# Wine-Case-Study

This is a retail case study, specifically done for wine selection, using machine learning techniques by Junge Zhang under the supervision of Dr. Maxime Cohen and Dr. Foster Provost.

The case study is based on the Kaggle Dataset Wine Reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). The case study aims to use clustering and classification models to pick wines for a new wine store. 

The repository includes a Five-Cluster folder and a Ten-Cluster folder, both of which include Python Scripts, Visualization, Descriptive Labels and Clustering Results. Except the Python Scripts folder which includes all Python codes for the case study, all others can be specifically referred to the case study report for their purposes.
