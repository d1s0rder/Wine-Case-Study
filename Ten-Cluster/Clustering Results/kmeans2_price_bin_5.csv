68186,Trimbach 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020–2035.",34.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,20-40
75163,Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2013  Sauternes,"As is often the case, a poor red wine vintage in Bordeaux is a good year for sweet wines. This unctuous wine, still young and dominated by 95% Sémillon, is beautifully balanced. Its honey and botrytis flavors give it a dry edge that comfortably contrasts with the opulent sweetness. The acidity, a source of freshness, gives the wine the lift it needs. Drink this serious and major wine from 2023.",45.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
78057,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035.",50.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
39002,Clos Troteligotte 2013 K-2 Malbec (Cahors),"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity. That makes for a wine that has a dusty texture coupled with a dry center of fruit and wood tannins. The acidity and the juicy berry fruits give freshness. Everything is ready for long aging. Drink from 2019.",60.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
48615,Château Calon Ségur 2013  Saint-Estèphe,This is an impressive wine that transcends the problems of the vintage. It has rich fruit that is sustained by the tannic structure that rests on a bed of fresh blackberry fruits cut with fresh acidity. The wine will certainly age well. Don't think about drinking it before 2024.,65.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
78042,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone.",65.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
47363,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Windsbuhl Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Ethereal notes of orange blossom and jasmine lead to richer tones of damask rose underpinned by a lively orange-peel freshness. The palate presents the same delicious juxtaposition of opulence and light-footed ease. Full of life and fragrant, vigorous joy, the wine has flavors that seem to linger forever.",80.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
88991,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Grand Cru Pfersigberg Doux Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer. The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything. The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",90.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
78045,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035.",100.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
92133,Château Pontet-Canet 2013  Pauillac,"This wine is rich, with generous black plum and berry fruits. It has a structure that is full, ripe and that will sustain the fruitiness of the wine over many years. The sensation is of velvet, with some force behind it. This remarkable wine will develop well over the medium term and then age for many years. Drink from 2022.",105.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
41081,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine Malbec (Cahors),"Created as an homage to the traditional powerful “black wines” that set the reputation of Cahors in Medieval times, this wine follows the old practice of heating the grape must before fermentation. The result is enormous concentration, seriously tannic ripe black fruit and considerable acidity. These are all elements that demand aging, and even at four years old this wine is just starting out. Drink from 2021 at the earliest.",112.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
78041,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.",120.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
70109,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",120.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
92132,Château Léoville Las Cases 2013  Saint-Julien,"This impressively powerful wine has dense tannins and concentration. With 74%  Cabernet Sauvignon, it is firm, packed with black-currant fruits with intense, perfumed acidity. Cabernet Franc adds spice to the wine. The wood aging is still showing and the wine will need several years before enjoying. Drink from 2025.",140.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
92131,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg.",365.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
92143,Château Margaux 2013  Margaux,"This wine is smooth, ripe with fine tannins and red plum and black-currant fruits that are soft and gentle. Acidity dominates at this stage, supported by the tannins. It brings out the fruit and freshness of the year while also keeping some structure from the high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025.",395.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
48622,Château Mouton Rothschild 2013  Pauillac,"This generous, almost opulent wine has both concentration and rounded fruits. It's open already, hinting at wood-aging while concentrating much more on the ripe fruits. Packed with fruit and tannins, it's densely textured. It will age, of course; don't start to drink before 2025.",400.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
92130,Château Cheval Blanc 2013  Saint-Émilion,"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024.",500.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
48617,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This is finely structured, a tense wine with great fruits and an intense texture. It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022. The production is tiny, and what is not fit for this wine goes into the Dillon Clarté wine.",767.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
48610,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"The production is tiny, yet the potential of this wine is enormous, with its tight, textured structure that is still so young. It is opulent and generous while still keeping a tight rein on its emotions. A steely core is surrounded by fruit that has hints of apricots as well as citrus. This will be a very fine wine but it needs many years, so wait until 2022.",932.0,97,5,0.9977465607915165,above 40
