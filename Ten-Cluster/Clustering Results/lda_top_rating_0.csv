74747,Foxen 2010 Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.",32.0,96,0,0.9689595419023359
41075,Ryan Cochrane 2015 Solomon Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This bottling from the San Francisco-based producer is about as Burgundian as California gets. Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor.",36.0,96,0,0.9653794146871733
42387,Williams Selyem 2010 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",65.0,96,0,0.9653744584943643
24010,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Solomon Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth.",34.0,95,0,0.9689598997448121
98044,Sandhi 2013 Mt. Carmel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end.",55.0,95,0,0.9653777423145299
111499,Illumination 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a blend of 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% Sémillon. It was partially barrel-fermented and then aged on the lees. It is a very great example of its genre, one of the best in memory. Shows intricate layers of Meyer lemons, kefir limes and white peaches, offset by crisp acidity and minerals but softened with buttercream and buttered toast. A vibrant, immaculate wine, one of the Sauvignon Blanc stars of the vintage.",40.0,95,0,0.9639911007662401
85571,Talley 2015 Oliver's Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Plump aromas of lemon mousse, meringue, wet limestone, white flowers and ripe key lime show on the nose of this excellent bottling. The palate bursts with flavors of cool cream, sea salt and lemon pith, set against a chalky texture. A mysteriously compelling experience.",38.0,95,0,0.9571371051299178
20086,Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Light but tropical notes touch on the fluffy nose of this bottling, with papaya-laced marshmallow, pineapple meringue, lemon curd and a sea salt caramel touch. Chamomile, yellow apple skins, yellow flowers, tight mango and lots of saltiness show on the mouth-watering sip. The buttery character grows as it warms up, but it's delicious in all temperatures.",35.0,94,0,0.9639935664484264
11582,Two Sisters 2014 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"From heritage clones of Wente and Mt. Eden, this top-end Chardonnay from the Foley family offers salted peaches, hazelnuts and crushed sea shells on a nose that recalls a steady sea breeze. It's light and brisk on the palate, with yellow pear, nectarine and lemon salt, all wrapped by a grippy texture. Excellent by itself, it would pair with foods from shellfish to roasted chicken.",55.0,94,0,0.9608598408753979
40191,Big Basin 2013 Coastview Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Light and a little cloudy in the glass, this is a delicious and deep wine from a vineyard in the eastern Salinas Valley, with lime blossoms, squeezed lemons, wet cement and salted white peach on the nose. The palate deftly pairs chalk, sour cream, and lime zest with dried white peach, sea salt and fresh churned butter.",44.0,94,0,0.9608590681827552
13613,Cullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve. Drink now–2025.",109.0,94,0,0.9608586598439732
30206,Barden 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now–2030.",48.0,94,0,0.9590830008912847
100910,Williams Selyem 2009 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Masses of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and mashed ripe pears in this marvelous wine, but that's not all. Buttered toast, crème brûlée, bananas sautéed in butter and brown sugar are some of the additional complexities. That makes the wine sound sweet, but it finishes dry. High in alcohol, but balanced, this flamboyant Chardonnay is best enjoyed now.",50.0,94,0,0.9590821920465792
93616,Testarossa 2014 Diana's Chardonnay (California),"The winery's best-barrel bottling of Chardonnay, this excels on all fronts, showing lemon peels, browned butter, creamy lily and pan-seared apples on the light, crisp yet savory nose. The mouthfeel is rich but decorated with zesty line of salty acidity that cuts through the lemon-curd flavors. Altogether mouthwatering, it's perfect for a seaside meal.",70.0,94,0,0.9590805465370557
63884,Paul Hobbs 2010 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This hits the palate with a strong oak presence, marked by flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch, honey and vanilla. But the wine evolves to show rich tropical fruit flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity. It defines California's modern take on white Burgundy.",70.0,94,0,0.9571343864946188
28831,Tablas Creek 2014 Roussanne (Adelaida District),"Roussanne is one of the more difficult grapes to get right, and these Rhône masters pulled it off this vintage with brilliance. Fascinating honey-laced melon cream and mango mochi aromas show on the dessert-like nose. The palate is bone-dry, however, with melon and honey mustard-like flavors, proving truly unique yet refreshingly delicious.",35.0,94,0,0.957133652753663
14613,Migration 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"An appealing wine for all types of Chardonnay palates, this bottling shows Meyer lemon zest, sea salt, tangerine pith, savory saffron and a touch of light butter on the nose. A salty lemon-curd flavor combo kicks off the palate, followed by honeysuckle and buttercream, proving rich yet dissected by smart acidity.",55.0,94,0,0.9571333921457935
115175,Talley 2014 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Sharp lime and pithy grapefruit notes accented by sour cream, chalk and limestone lead the nose of this wine from the pioneering Talley family. Nectarine, sea salt and Gravenstein apple flavors play on the palate, which strikes a happy balance between savory and tart, finishing with buttery depth.",48.0,94,0,0.9571319501360617
68194,Center of Effort 2013 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"This bottling shows touches of smoke, flint, Meyer lemon peel, honeysuckle and crisp jicama on the nose. A hint of ripe nectarine kicks off the palate before its knee-buckling acidity takes hold, bringing forth lemon peel, lime juice and more honeysuckle elements.",35.0,94,0,0.9571290843260151
63174,Chamisal Vineyards 2012 Chamise Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"This wine by winemaker Fintan du Fresne shows sea salt, apple blossom, cherimoya and tangerine rinds on the nose. Flavors are clean and pure, with dried apple, more sea salt, a bit of nectarine and orange spritz, offering a profile that could comfortably rest on the tongue all day long.",60.0,94,0,0.9549925644463426
