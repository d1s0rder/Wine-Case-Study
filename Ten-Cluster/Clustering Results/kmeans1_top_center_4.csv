3,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",65.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
19,Acrobat 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot.

23,Castello di Amorosa 2011 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site.

30,Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.",50.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
36,Hawkins Cellars 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.",22.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
69,Z'IVO 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.",25.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
141,Albatross Ridge 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.",55.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
156,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",44.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
160,Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.",38.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
168,McIntyre Vineyards 2006 Mission Ranch Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart.

172,Harrington 2006 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit.

208,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",15.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997
228,Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",45.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997
231,Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry.

261,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",34.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
263,J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.",52.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
265,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future.

324,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
347,Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry.

402,Rusack 2011 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes.",45.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997

410,Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",65.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
423,Babcock 2010 Ocean's Ghost Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir.

453,D.R. Stephens 2014 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure.

454,Davis Family 2014 Soul Patch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.",55.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
455,Davis Family 2014 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove.",55.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
460,Rex Hill 2014 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",55.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
461,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.",65.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
464,Tumwater 2014 Prince Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit.

469,Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",50.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
470,Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",50.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
475,Paul O'Brien 2014 Bradley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA.

476,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Twin Creeks Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus.

It's light in body but full of grippy texture.",42.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
477,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets.

485,Iron Horse 2013 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site.

This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

563,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention.

618,Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone.

644,Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side.

686,Lane Tanner 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian.

705,Adelsheim 2010 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.",105.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
718,Beacon Hill 2013 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago.

907,Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",40.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
911,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",75.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
945,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",24.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997
962,Sea Slopes 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola.

963,Trisaetum 2014 Family Reserve MMXIV Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.",100.0,94,4,0.9996405212884997
964,Bergström 2015 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine.

987,Dion 2014 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.",50.0,94,4,0.9996405212884997
989,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor.

3003,Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir.

3116,Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest.

3173,Eola Hills 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"One of Oregon's best-kept secrets is this well-made budget-priced Pinot from Eola Hills. Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit.

3477,Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity.

4061,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core.

4066,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent.

Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",72.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997

4077,Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",50.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
4087,Gary Farrell 2010 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Tastes a little vegetal and simple, with cherry jam, asparagus and sweet oak flavors. Not a success, and a particular disappointment compared to the winery's other 2010 single-vineyard Pinots.",50.0,82,4,0.9996405212884997

4108,Rock Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This single vineyard cuvée is quite light, yet retains your interest with a thin dusting of cocoa and ground coffee around the tangy berry fruit.

4200,Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish.

4227,Coeur de Terre 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.",22.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
4228,Cummins Road 2012 Pinot Noir,"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish.",25.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997

4491,Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices.

4701,Hyland 2012 Select Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Just one barrel was made of this reserve.

4882,Fullerton 2014 Croft Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Coming on stiff and herbal, the Croft needs some time and patience. There are not quite resolved streaks of citrus, cherries, earthy tannins and a touch of cocoa powder. Still a baby, this should improve over the next three to five years.",43.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
4883,Gehricke 2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"An elegant, restrained wine from the earthy appellation cooled by Pacific Ocean winds, this wine conveys a plethora of pretty clove, tea and rose petals, finished in cinnamon stick and vanilla.",39.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
4890,Willful 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Nicely textured strawberry fruit is featured here. It drinks almost like an especially rich rosé, fresh and simple, in a good way. There's a dash of bitter green in the finishing tannins.",26.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
4898,Black Kite 2009 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Defines a certain California style in the intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, whose sweetness is accented by caramelized oak. Delicious, and the acidity and tannins are just fine, but it's a little obvious, and wants greater subtlety.",52.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
4916,Longoria 2011 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There are some lean, green peppercorn, mint and herb flavors that suggest unripeness. The chilly vintage appears to have taken its toll, despite some well-oaked raspberry and cherry lushness. Drink up.",50.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
4920,Merriam 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a good, everyday Pinot that's rich and sweet in berries and cherries, with plenty of oak to give it that buttered toast and vanilla deliciousness. Enjoy it now.",40.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
4922,Peters Family 2009 Sonoma Stage VIneyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is heavy and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, with soft acids and rich cherry, currant, anise and mocha flavors. Doesn't have the structure for aging, so drink up.",45.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
4929,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Whole Cluster Fermented Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit.

4930,Wy'East Vineyards 2010 Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Fermented in one ton French oak fermenters, this estate grown Pinot Noir from 1980s plantings has notes of cherry, char, and butterscotch.

5018,Miner 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side.",60.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
5039,Rex Hill 2008 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style.

5046,Stephen Ross 2009 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"One of the richer, riper Edna Valley Pinots, offering waves of raspberry and cherry marmalade flavors. It sure is delicious, if a little direct. Drink now with lusty fare, like cold smoked salmon or chorizo.",32.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997

5069,Longoria 2006 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Typical of a fine young S&B; Pinot, this is rather hard and closed in tannins now, although decanting will help coax out the cherry and currant fruit. But it really needs a good 4–6 years.",45.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
5070,Apolloni 2006 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value.",45.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
5076,Retour 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging. Some whole cluster fermentation and native yeasts contribute to the complexity.

5101,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.",43.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
5113,Firefly Night 2008 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.",55.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
5125,Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young.

5148,Iron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy.

5170,Lincourt 2013 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity.",30.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5172,Patz & Hall 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pungent, spicy earth and cinnamon rise out of the wine's bouquet, inviting one to enjoy a structured expression of cranberry, raspberry and black tea. The tannin structure is well managed and the oak strong, yet integrated. Gap's Crown is among the vineyards that figure into the blend, along with several Dutton family properties. This is fresh and focused.",46.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5176,Balletto 2013 Sexton Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a steep hillside vineyard that is estate owned and farmed, this wine is pungent in dark fruit and black tea.

5181,Davies 2013 Nobles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Light and smoothly textured, this beautifully crafted wine is earthy in wild strawberry preserves, mushroom and forest floor.

5188,Landmark 2013 Escolle Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dark loam and a slate-driven minerality restrain the concentrated black raspberry and black currant ripeness on the nose of this elegant wine, made by a Sonoma-based group co-founded in 1972 by a descendant of tractor-maker John Deere. Lots of eucalyptus and purple sage shrubbery on the palate spices up the soft, luscious blackberry and olallieberry fruit core.",35.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5189,Last Light 2013 Derbyshire Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"This wine from an extreme coastal vineyard is framed by earthy notes of turned black loam as well as a cherry blossom ripeness, with a laid-back sagebrush element and touch of olive. There's a lot of thyme and marjoram on the palate, as well as orange rinds, plum peel, barely ripe cranberry fruit and a graphite tension.",34.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5191,Loring Wine Company 2013 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Ah, the beautiful fruit aromas, polished texture, ripe but tangy flavors and supreme balance make this an elegant and delicious wine.

5381,MacPhail 2013 Wildcat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's a touch of reduction on the nose of this wine, which otherwise offers a nutty profile that's somewhat shut down. Oaky and smoky, it has a bit of minty chocolate on the thick, full-bodied palate.",49.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
5414,Tamber Bey 2015 Walala Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation.

5415,Tantara 2015 Tondre Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This bottling explores the more concentrated side of Pinot Noir, with hearty aromas of balsamic fig sauce, cooked berries, clove and rum cake.

5423,Torii Mor 1998 Balcombe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Starts off with softly perfumed cherries and dried leaves, then turns strongly piny on the palate.

5425,Erath 1998 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Snappy and full of raspberry and cedar aromas. It’s mouthfilling and juicy, with a stylish lean edge to it. Puckery on the palate, with a right-on mix of acidity, fruit and oak.

5426,Evesham Wood 1998 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.",24.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
5429,Bear Creek 1998 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.",30.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
5434,Andrew Rich 1998 Les Vigneaux Corral Creek Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food.",25.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
5435,Argyle 1998 Spirit House Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"For those who like their Pinot oaky, this may be just the ticket. It starts out with caramel, coffee and chocolate aromas skillfully matched with sour cherries and a bouquet garni of green herbs.

5438,Tualatin Estate 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years.",24.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
5439,Cristom 1998 Louise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dark in color, almost pure purple; the bouquet carries some heavy oak, with aromas of toast and vanilla. It’s also a little sauvage.

Plenty of verve on the palate, which emphasizes fruit and more fruit. The frame is sleek, but it capably carries the wine’s zip.",25.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
5446,Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel.

5447,Adelsheim 1998 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power.",40.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997

5502,Wedell Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta.

5503,Winderlea 2013 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The old-vine estate vineyard delivers a well-balanced, elegant wine that shows mineral and steel along with tart berry fruit. Despite a much lighter vintage than 2012, there is enough density and depth to reward some additional cellar time.",60.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5509,Angela Estate 2013 Pinot Noir,"The label does not bear the name Angela Vineyard, but the fruit is estate grown. This is a tight, focused, young red wine, with tangy raspberry fruit that touches on black cherry. Vivid and penetrating, it needs plenty of time to breathe, and as it does it reveals subtle layers of mocha and caramel. This has the bones to age. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5510,Archery Summit 2013 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago.

5512,Arista 2013 U.V. Lucky Well Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a Ulises Valdez-farmed vineyard, along the same fence line as Valdez's Silver Eagle, this smoky, succulent wine has a reductive quality that will benefit from more time in bottle. Blackberry, strawberry and earth provide a fleshy aspect of intrigue. Cellar through 2023.",64.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
5515,Bethel Heights 2013 Casteel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A barrel by barrel selection results in this reserve-level cuvée.

5637,Gary Farrell 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California.

It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H.

6093,Hawley 2010 Estines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a very big, rich, extracted Pinot.

6711,Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"There is not much going on here. As with most California Pinots in this price range, the Erath is a stripped-down, pale and insubstantial take on the grape.

7691,Cakebread 2014 Two Creeks Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Great fruit concentration and depth give power to this full-bodied wine from Cakebread, better known for its Napa-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Not tricked up with too much oak, it tastes energized, deep and layered. Black cherry, rhubarb and cedar fan out across the palate, lingering a long time on the finish. Best from 2018.",42.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
7705,Alma Rosa 2006 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a very good wine, albeit with some coarseness to the tannins at this time. It's also a little earthy and mushroomy. But there's a solid core of black cherry, red currant, mocha and tangerine zest flavors. The vineyard is near Sanford & Benedict, whose Pinots require time to come around. This young wine should do interesting things.",49.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
7707,MacPhail 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Very dry and elegantly silky, this Pinot, from one of the best vineyards in the valley, brims with cherry, red currant, cola, licorice and peppery spice flavors.

7749,Walt 2011 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Delicious and soft in raspberries, cherries and the sweet vanilla and the cinnamon toast of new oak, this is a charming Pinot to drink now. It's light and airy in the mouth. Perfect with a simply prepared grilled steak or lamb chop.",60.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
7756,Mansfield-Dunne 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"If fruit were the only thing that counted, this Pinot would get a perfect score, with an upfront burst of cherries, strawberries and raspberries. The oak appliqué is rich and balanced, and the tannin-acid structure is just fine. Its powerful fruit notes suggest to give it 6–7 years.",48.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
7761,MacMurray Ranch 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up.",35.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
7801,Alma Rosa 2007 La Encantada Vineyard - Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Softly tannic and direct in jammy blackberry, cherry and red plum flavors, with chocolate overtones that have a candied, sugary edge. Not showing a great deal of complexity now, but could evolve in a few years. Hard to predict.",49.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
7807,Keller Estate 2006 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a big, rich, thick Pinot that almost seems more like a southern Rhône wine, it's that dark and full-bodied.

7808,Merry Edwards 2006 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.",60.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
7815,Etude 2006 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance. Drink now and over the next few years.",60.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
7823,Stephen Ross 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is somewhat lean, but its elegantly tailored in its brisk acidity and dryness. While the cherry and berry flavors are modest, the wine's austerity makes it versatile with an enormous range of foods.",38.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
7906,Glenora 2012 Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"A pretty spray of cherry blossom perfume runs from start to finish on this off-dry rosé. It's a bit honeyed on the palate, with ripe, luscious cherry flavor, but it's quaffable and undeniably tasty.",14.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
7910,Ancien 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This cleanly made wine has potential to live long in the cellar. Intensely focused aromas of black raspberry and black plum combine with crushed asphalt and a touch of purple flowers on the nose. The tightly wound palate slowly reveals tart boysenberry, char and pine resin, flavors that the firm structure will reveal even more deliciously with time. Drink 2018–2029.",52.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997

7945,Albatross Ridge 2014 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. There is great energy on the palate, with mulberry and elderberry flavors enhanced by light coffee, soil and fennel bulbs.",55.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7951,Gary Farrell 2014 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus.",75.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7954,Gary Farrell 2014 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Bringing together multiple sites in one wine, this provides a fine example of the sum equalling more than the parts.

7956,Melville 2014 Sandy's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This winery's bottlings manage to pack bright, fruity energy and a wide array of herbs and seasonings into the same lithe frame. In this case, sagebrush and chaparral meet candied red cherry and dark pomegranate on the nose.

7959,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait.",65.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7995,Pessagno 2006 Lucia Highlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years.",28.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
8012,Stoller 2010 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously.",25.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
8019,Erath 2010 La Nuit Magique Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort—along with the Battle Creek bottling—in 2010.

8033,Aiken 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years.",55.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
8034,Anam Cara 2010 Mark V Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The Mark V bottling usually gets the most new oak, but in this light vintage the wood has been kept in check.

8063,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This mountaintop winery puts much effort in single-vineyard expressions, but this blend rivals even those, with nose-tingling aromas of concentrated hibiscus and pomegranate, plus dried sour cherries and graphite. Prominent herbs like oregano, thyme and dried sage mix with eucalyptus and menthol on the palate, where soft cranberry fruit serves as backbone.",36.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8078,Spindrift Cellars 2007 Spinnaker Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This joins the happily increasing ranks of Oregon Pinots under $20 that can successfully compete with entry-level bottles from New Zealand, California and Burgundy.

8087,Arcane Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade.",24.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
8095,Ken Wright 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.",25.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997

8373,Soléna 2013 Grande Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.",28.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
8396,Tom Eddy 2012 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Dark-colored and deeply flavored, this full-bodied wine smells smoky and meaty, tastes savory, feels firm and appropriately tannic. Showing the more robust, hearty side of Pinot, it can be paired successfully with most opulent meat and fowl dishes.",60.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
8399,YNOT 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious",26.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
8423,Joseph Phelps 2013 Quarter Moon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a 100% estate wine from the producer's cool-climate sites near the town of Freestone. Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops. Soft and mellow, it's also feral and funky, with a strong essence of mushroomy forest floor.",75.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8436,Merry Edwards 2013 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange. It is softly voluptuous and velvety, though young, with a biting chewiness that should mellow in the cellar. Drink now through 2028.",57.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8444,Chenoweth 2013 Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This wine is from the Chenoweth grape-growing family and is made from three of its finest vineyard sites: Chenoweth Ranch, Treehouse and Bootleggers, all special spots that have produced grapes for special producers.

8445,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Classic Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices.

8450,Fiddlehead 2011 Lollapalooza Fiddlestix Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Elegant and silky on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of pressed violet, rose bud, grape candy, cherry blossom and lilac. There is a lot of cinnamon and star anise spice on the palate as well as a strong touch of licorice that's laid across deep olallieberry fruit and a lavender florality.",80.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8451,Foretell 2012 Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Stemmy wet forest and a distinct note of mushroom opens this exotic wine, a full-bodied and concentrated expression of the coast.

8474,Talbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is not a successful Sleepy Hollow Vineyard bottling.

8482,Donum 2013 Ten Oaks Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Another tiny production, made in a different style from many of the other designates released by the producer this year, Ten Oaks is named for the, yes, 10 trees bordering the vineyard. Medium in tannin and oak, with a surprising lightness of being, it shows a citrus-like quality that makes it refreshing, while a sublime texture keeps rolling along the tongue.",72.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
8491,Maggy Hawk 2013 Stormin' Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The color of this wine is deep and dark, and the aromas and flavors both have lots of plump black cherry, baking spice and clove tones. It's dry, full bodied and pretty massive in terms of mouthfeel, so this is not a delicate flower and is best enjoyed with heartier fare or after some time to open.",66.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
8495,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling.

8549,Gros Ventre 2013 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an earthy, ethereal, lighter-bodied wine.

8565,Bethel Heights 2014 Flat Block Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),This limited block selection comes from own-rooted vines planted in 1979. Full-fruited flavors combine into a fresh and lush mix of berries and cherries with a citrusy kick. There's a tropical punch sensibility combined with the texture and depth of a very fine Pinot.

8583,Keller 2014 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a wildly exotic wine, vibrantly abuzz in cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, a side note of barnyard-like earth and pretty rose petal. Tight-grained acidity remains firm in the glass and supportive of a grittiness of texture, notes of clove and black tea spiked throughout.",45.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8598,Elizabeth Rose 2012 Pinot Noir (Yountville),"Rustic earth and forest emanate from this Pinot Noir, a rare find from Yountville, a growing area more devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon.

8612,Bonneau 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Earthy and recalling the aromas of a woodshed or old barn, this tastes of darker fruit. Relatively lean on the palate, it ends as abruptly as it starts.",42.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997
8632,Au Bon Climat 2010 Talley Vineyard Rincon Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",40.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
8648,Kirkland Signature 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in fairly large quantities for a wide swath of palates, this wine is grippy in tannins and possessed of sizable weight and power.",13.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997

8670,Foxen 2013 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",64.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
8677,Antiquum Farm 2013 Juel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot.

8683,Della 2013 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal.

8696,Winderlea 2013 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits.

8747,Adler Fels 2014 The Eagle Rock Pinot Noir,"This blend of 76% Sta.

8800,Le Cadeau 2014 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix.

8834,Russian Hill 2005 Tara Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate.

It opens to a like palate, but the wine has an essentially lean, even sharp character, with rather high acidity for the thin fruit.

With a cool vintage, the wine feels a bit tough with prominent tannins and acidity. It's a balanced, elegant wine, however, with flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and heirloom tomato. Drink now–2016.",68.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9212,Longplay 2011 Lia's Vineyard Hi-Tone Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This cuvée features grapes from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's a light, elegant mix of pomegranate and cherry pie flavors with plenty of natural acidity behind it. Cola and dried herb highlights add complexity, and a persistent minerality buoys the finish.",45.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9214,Marimar Estate 2010 La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is sourced from grapes grown in an organic estate vineyard in the heart of the Green Valley. Flavors of raspberries and pomegranates are delicious, and new French oak marries seamlessly with the fruit. Vibrant coastal acidity makes everything sing. If there's an off note, it's a mushroom and veggie note, courtesy of the cold vintage. The wine is already softening in tannins so drink now.",44.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9230,Schug 2009 Rouge de Noirs Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is like a sparking Shiraz from Australia. It's pretty much as dark in color as a red wine, with a full body and a raspberry pie flavor. The palate is a little bit scouring and sweet, along with the classic yeastiness of a sparkling wine.",30.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
9243,Chime 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"What a great Pinot, and look at that price. The wine is translucent in ruby hue, dry, silky in texture and crisp in acids, showing the textural hallmarks of a fine coastal bottling. The raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors are delicious and complex. A terrific value. Production was 1,100 cases.",19.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9249,Thomas Fogarty 2008 Rapley Trail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a very nice Pinot Noir for drinking soon.

9251,Churchill Cellars 2008 Bella Luna Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Give this polished Pinot an hour or two of decanting and serve it now with a good steak, or try prosciutto-wrapped dates for an exotic appetizer. It's dry, rich and spicy, with ripe cherry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors, edged with sweet, smoky sandalwood.",45.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9252,Churchill Cellars 2008 Bella Sonoma Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot is made in a lighter style, but it's complex and interesting. It's marked by dryness and acidic crispness. The raspberry, cola and persimmon flavors are enriched with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Seems best now, but it could surprise over the next six years.",39.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9305,MacPhail 2010 Wildcat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a full-bodied Pinot Noir that's a little high in alcohol, but that's the cost of all the richness. The flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pie, sweet date and smoky, buttery vanilla are frankly addictive. Lovely pairings would be grilled salmon steaks with a fruity salsa or lamb chops in a wine reduction sauce.",49.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9310,Cambria 2010 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a big, fleshy wine, with evident tannins and acidity that give it bite and structure. The flavors are ripe and pure, suggesting red and black cherry pie filling, with lots of dusty spice and a hint of sweet oak. It will be very nice now and over the next 4–5 years. And with more than 22,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",25.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9323,Laetitia 2009 Les Galets Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This offers big bursts of ripe cherry and raspberry jam, but that richness is complicated by minerality, earthiness and firm tannins, giving it true complexity. It's not very subtle, and you might think it's a Grenache if you didn't know what you were tasting, but it's certainly delicious. Drink over the next few years.",60.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9331,Nefarious 2013 Madrona Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lake Chelan's Nefarious stretches out with this impressive Oregon Pinot Noir. Stiff and compact when first opened, it fills out nicely. The fruit runs from pomegranate to mountain berry to plum, with a touch of peppery spice. The midpalate continues to broaden and gather strength through a long finish.",37.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9335,Sarah's Vineyard 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Deeply brooding notes of crushed violets, rose petals, black cherries, thyme and sagebrush make for a manly take on this often feminine grape. Elderberry fruit shows on the palate, as do more violets and lilacs, dried mint, sagebrush, menthol and pine-needle flavors.",36.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9336,Soléna 2014 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Young, spicy and forward, this immediately accessible wine is a bowl of cherry candy, backed with pineapple highlights from natural acidity. It's full in the mouth, still with primary fruit flavors, but the structure to age gracefully over the next five to eight years.",55.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9343,Hyland 2014 Coury Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate.

9350,Elk Cove 2014 Goodrich Pinot Noir,"This is the first time this recently purchased vineyard has been featured as an Elk Cove designate. Planted in 2007, it's just coming into its own. The young fruit is tight and tangy—a mix of raspberry and black cherry. Forward, bright and lightly spicy, it's nicely focused effort with some high acid snap to the finish.",60.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9352,Vidon Vineyard 2013 Hans Clone Pommard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Softly smoky, with pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, this strikes a lovely balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and seductive, the flavors seamless and the balance spot on.",50.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9377,Summerland 2010 Vintners Select Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Heavy and dull, with a soft texture framing cherry, berry and spice flavors. Pinot's famously silky texture is there, but the wine isn't offering much else.",35.0,85,4,0.9996405212884997
9399,Cellars 33 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a blend of grapes sourced from three vineyard sites, including Keefer, one of the producer's vineyard designates, this wine displays a light red color. It has a noticeably supple texture, a soft expression of cranberry and red cherry accented by black tea.",33.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9405,Donkey & Goat 2013 Helluva Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has a medium-deep color with a slightly purple rim. Fresh and fruity aromas bring to mind strawberry juice, tart cherries and rose-hip tea. With medium body and enough tannin for a velvety texture, this well-mannered, slightly restrained wine keeps asking for another sip.",30.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9414,Phelps Creek 2007 Le Petit Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"For an inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a lovely, expansive aroma that mingles rose petals, strawberry, white chocolate and cola. This is elegant, supple and entirely approachable, with none of the hard, earthy, vegetal or bitter character that can often characterize inexpensive Pinots. Think of a really good village Burgundy from a ripe vintage such as 2005, but at a much better price.",18.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
9415,Ponzi 2006 Tavola Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Soft, silky and seductive, this qualifies as an outstanding everyday Pinot (by Oregon standards) that offers more subtle scent and flavor than most under-$30 bottles. Violets, cherries and star anise are mixed in the nose; the palate adds herbal and earthy nuances.",25.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
9432,Trione 2008 River Road Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This Pinot certainly has lots of concentrated fruit, with an intensity of cherry and raspberry jam, pomegranates and cola. It's also well oaked, to judge from the strong layer of buttered cinnamon toast. Feels strong and indelicate now, with a punch of acidity, but could mellow over the next 2–3 years.",35.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
9435,Pfendler 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"An example of a soft, accessible Pinot whose rich, ripe flavors are the main attraction. Brims with cola, cherry, cranberry and red licorice flavors. Seems best over the next 2–3 years.",45.0,88,4,0.9996405212884997
9521,Expression 39 2013 Ordway Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A sense of depth and gravity imbues this full-bodied and richly flavored wine. It smells woodsy and mushroomy along with lots of ripe plum. It feels broad and plump on the palate, is nicely supported by moderate tannins and acidity, and has a lingering finish.",50.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9523,Fritz 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation. Layered, with a twinge of yeasty baked bread, it has a strong personality, stemmy and feral, with a lasting linger of grenadine.",40.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9535,Chêne 2014 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"An intriguingly and wondrously unique nose offers baked plum, shaved kola nut, pressed red rose buds, cinnamon and dried tea leaves. The palate carries that array of scents forward, showing root beer and more kola nut as well as tobacco lead, slate and slightly sour black plum skins.",48.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9561,Mahoney 2009 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A tight, dry and somewhat one-dimensional Pinot Noir. It offers cherry, cola and spice flavors, and is elegantly structured. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, but it's ready for drinking now.",36.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
9605,Lucienne 2012 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish.",50.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
9629,Adelsheim 2008 Quarter Mile Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Sadly, just 44 cases were produced, from Block 1 of the original estate vineyard. Rhubarb, cherry, cinnamon and suggestions of light tropical fruits are delicately entwined here. It would be easy to skip over the wine's complexity; you must let it breathe open and it will reward you with fascinating, subtle layers that slowly unravel.",90.0,94,4,0.9996405212884997
9642,Brogan 2006 Michaela's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",110.0,94,4,0.9996405212884997
9643,Calera 2007 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Typically Calera's most luscious, delicious wine in youth. The year 2007 was kind, and the result is a Pinot rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and cola, wrapped into a silky texture, with near perfect acids and tannins. As good as it is now, it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",45.0,94,4,0.9996405212884997
9650,Brogan 2007 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"What's so likeable about this Pinot is its dryness, silkiness and elegance. It shows a cool-climate structure, with a bite of acidity and fine tannins, and tantalizing flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and minerals. Should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",50.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9651,Calera 2007 Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",40.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9720,Vidon Vineyard 2007 Three Clones Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively.",39.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9736,Pali 2011 Rancho La Viña Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The wine tastes and feels tight and remote now, despite luscious raspberry, strawberry and oak flavors. But the promise is there, with firm tannins, crisp acidity and bracing minerality providing the structure for aging. This should hit its stride between 2015–2017.",56.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9739,Melville 2011 Terraces Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness.",56.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
9749,Big Basin 2012 Alfaro Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins.",48.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9762,Freeman 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is rich and ripe, oozing with black cherry, boysenberry and strawberry jam aromas and flavors. It feels full and rather soft on the palate, as the acidity and tannins appear very mild.",45.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9777,DanCin 2015 Écarté Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA. It's loaded with ripe, fleshy cherry fruit and suggestions of steely minerality, typical of the terroir. Big, full, delicious and nicely balanced, it wraps up with a yummy chocolaty finish.",38.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9778,Decroux 2015 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This bottling's core of black cherry fragrance is wrapped in sugar plum, balsamic, allspice and nutmeg notes, combining elegance and power. Mulberry and wild cherry flavors show on the palate, lifted by baking spice and gingerbread accents and balanced by solid acidity and tannins. A sagebrush note pops on the finish.",75.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9779,Domaine Eden 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This wine's wild raspberry, mace, composting violets, kola nut and musk hints make for a very pretty but extremely complex nose. Fermented with 30% whole clusters, it's energetic on the palate, with dark cranberry and sharp raspberry flavors enhanced by allspice and anise. It has a very long finish.",35.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9783,Fess Parker 2015 Older Barrel Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas.

9788,Roark Wine Co. 2015 Burning Creek Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark.

9789,Lavinea 2014 Elton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead. The old-vine grapes create a skeleton of mineral and acid upon which just-ripe fruit flavors of mulberry, plum and blueberry are placed. Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer.",75.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9790,Lavinea 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This deeply fruited wine is a rich cranberry/purple in hue, and flavors put blueberry and plum front and center. There's a touch of cassis, and the tannins are brushed velvety smooth, while remaining substantial, even muscular. Bergamot, pomegranate and marionberry flavors come through as well, in a lush cascade of spicy fruits.",55.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9791,Lucienne 2015 Hook Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Winemaker Paul Clifton excelled in this vintage, finding the balance between the region's ripe fruit, natural acidity and powerful spice. Baked black cherry, hibiscus, earth, gingerbread and cola notes show on the nose. The palate is creamy and lush, but the acidity is persistent, carrying its dark red fruit and minty chocolate flavors into the finish.",50.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9793,Windrun 2015 Vintage Selection No. 12 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish.",33.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9796,Bethel Heights 2015 Casteel Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"A barrel-selection, top-of-the-line cuvée, this is intensely aromatic with black cherry, soft leather and baking spices in play.

Overall it's a big wine, full flavored, balanced and already drinking very well.",75.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9825,Saxon Brown 2009 Parmelee-Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This small-production single-vineyard Pinot Noir is dry, elegant and may be deceptively simple in its youth. It feels delicate now, almost fragile, with the suggestion of barely ripe cherries and cola that's been left out overnight so it loses its spritz. It's a wine of nuance, not power, and could easily develop dramatically over the next six years.",48.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9833,Gresser 2009 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.",24.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997

9852,Chehalem 2015 Corral Creek Vineyards Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This aromatic wine offers rich fruit and floral scents. It's tart and spicy on the palate, with bright red fruit. Although aged in 42% new and 33% one-year barrels, oak-derived flavors aren't evident. Still, it's a young wine pulling itself together.",50.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9855,Delgado 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Caramel toasted oak contributes a concentrated richness to this full-bodied expression of the coast—a dark brooding offering of baked cherry and cola spice.

9856,Dois Irmãos 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Plum, black cherry and mocha cflavors ombine in this smooth, well-integrated wine. It must have seen some time in new oak, and the pretty baking spice accents add length and pleasure to the finish.",35.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
9884,Keller 2011 El Coro Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The tough, earthy taste of raw mushrooms makes this Pinot less than lush. That's despite some good Lifesaver candy raspberry flavors. The grapes are from the estate vineyard, in the Petaluma Gap. Cold vintage, cool growing area, slightly unripe wine.",52.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
9887,MacMurray Ranch 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"With a delicate, silky mouthfeel and bright acidity, this wine fulfils Pinot's basic requirements.

9889,Pali 2012 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Intensely ripe raspberry and cherry pie flavors mark this wine. Oak brings even greater richness, in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. The finish is dry, and there's a good burst of acidity. The alcohol is a little hot, but still, it's a nice, silky wine for drinking now.",23.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997
9896,Joseph Soggé 2014 DeNatale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light and clear in color, this ethereal and delicate wine is earthy, with a brightness of cherries and a woodsy back note. Subtle in alcohol and power, it provides a food-friendly experience of cardamom and rose petals that makes it pretty on the nose and elusive on the palate.",38.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9901,Torii Mor 2013 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This pure Pommard-clone bottling offers lighter red fruit with highlights of cocoa and baking spices.

9904,R. Stuart & Co. 2013 Vignette Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This unfined and unfiltered wine carries itself lightly, as is appropriate to the vintage and the grape. It's clean and delicate, with light raspberry fruit and hints of leaf and dried herb.",30.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9905,"R. Stuart & Co. 2014 Love, Oregon Pinot Noir (Oregon)","Scents of rose powder and petals come up first, followed by hints of cherries. Then the palate brings raspberries, with a sour-candy tanginess. The cleansing acids and overall balance are pitch perfect.",28.0,89,4,0.9996405212884997
9907,Spindrift Cellars 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This displays the bright and polished fruit of this excellent vintage.

9909,Krutz 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source.

9918,Alchemist 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Firm but fully ripe, this mixes black cherry and dark chocolate in a tight and chewy style.

9935,Schug 1998 Heritage Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Specially selected lots account for this top-of-the-line bottling. It's really very good. The fruit tends toward raspberries and cherries, and it's smooth as silk in the mouth. The nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and peppery notes last for a long time on the finish. The difference between this and the typical Carneros bottling is intensity; the fruit is more focused. It's the difference, say, between a flashlight and a laser.",30.0,93,4,0.9996405212884997
9941,Schug 1998 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Cherry-berry fruit, spice, a velvety texture and a long finish make for a lovely wine, soft and limpid, but with underlying power. The tannins are as light as air, but somehow substantial anyway. The framework is exceptional. You'll be smacking your lips over this beauty.",18.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997

9975,Castle Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Medium body and an attractive earthy, oaky flavor profile make this wine a little different from the norm and a great value.

10202,Coeur de Terre 2014 Abby's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age.",65.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
10203,Coeur de Terre 2014 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Crafted principally from estate-grown fruit, this has the complexity and downright panache of a far more expensive bottling.

10222,Purple Hands 2015 Kropf Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"When first opened, this seemed a bit shallow, but it blossomed with breathing time into a lovely brambly berry-soaked wine with a full-bodied palate.

10227,Phillips Hill 2012 Boontling Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has a medium-garnet color, not overly dark, and the aromas are a bit restrained.

10244,DanCin 2012 Pas de Trois Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Grapes from three vineyards (estate, Hyland and Durant) and seven different clones are blended here, then aged for 14 months in 40% new French oak. At first sniff it's more steely than oaky, with chunky flavors of red fruits firmly underscored with highlights of earth and stem. There's a vein of black licorice also, and the wine leaves the impression that waiting until 2016–2017 will help bring out its best.",34.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
10248,Foursight 2012 Charles Vineyard Zero Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Not too deep in color or overly effusive in aroma, this nevertheless full-bodied wine has fresh red cherry and plum flavors backed by firm acidity and tannins.

10297,Ermisch 2010 Eréndira Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine.",35.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
10298,Fig 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Created by Joshua Klapper, the fine winemaker at La Fenetre, for Santa Monica's Fig Restaurant, this wine is balanced in alcohol and subtle, but complex in its array of fruits, spices, earth, oak, tannins and acids.

10303,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 114 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Bolinas-based Sean Thackrey's new project, Cassiopeia is centered on one block from a single Anderson Valley vineyard. His quest was to see what four different Pinot Noir clones on one rootstock, all the same age, and treated otherwise similarly, could become once turned into wine. This, the 114, is lightly rendered, though deceptively full and meaty, tasting of dark cherry and herb.",45.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997

10309,Whitcraft 2011 Pence Ranch Clone 828 Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness.

10329,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2005 Laurène Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.",65.0,92,4,0.9996405212884997
10353,Prodigal 2015 Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of three clones shows plump red-plum and hibiscus aromas on the nose as well as sharp cinnamon, cola and sumac spices.

10397,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2015 Trouble Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There's a funky, foxy note and a sour edge to this wine, which seems disjointed, or perhaps still showing a little bottle shock.

10420,Furthermore 2010 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Flavor wasn't a problem with this Pinot, which comes from a great vineyard. It floods the mouth with raspberries and cherries. There's also lots of oak influence, in the form of buttered toast and sweet wood sap.

10492,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Bernau Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years.",55.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
10497,Thistle 2007 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Thistle makes a spicy, herbal, earthy style of Pinot Noir, so don't look for sweet, ripe, jammy flavors.

10515,Stoller 2007 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),This is a standout in this price range.

10544,Toretti's 2010 Inocencio Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Sharp and minty, this wine has some underripe notes, yet the flavor of peppery black cherry tastes jammy. The alcohol is high and somewhat unbalanced, which gives the wine a heavy mouthfeel.",44.0,84,4,0.9996405212884997

11011,Rusack 2008 Rancho Santa Rosa Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Rusack's best 2008 Pinot comes from this great vineyard that displays such fine Santa Rita Hills character. It's ripe enough in cherries to satisfy, and also brisk in acidity, with complex mineral and herb notes, and the oak barrel layering is perfect.

11018,Kason 2007 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This reserve is the best of Kason's 2007 releases, with cranberry fruit, minty spice, moderate tannins and overall balance. The thinness of the vintage shows through, and this will need to be drunk now, rather than cellared. Aging in 80% new French oak puts some toast into the finish.",28.0,87,4,0.9996405212884997
11020,M. Autumn 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the dryness and crispness you want in a fine coastal Pinot Noir, with good flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranate juice and sandalwood.

11207,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A fairly subdued, mostly mineral-driven nose characterizes this wine by the Santa Clara Valley-based producer founded in 1978, with bits of brick and graphite most prevalent.

11257,Windy Bay 2011 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Most of what this wine has to offer comes through its enchanting aromas of mint, cranberry, and toasty spice. The palate—light, delicate, and tart—can't quite deliver on this promise. Still, a varietally correct Oregon Pinot Noir at this price? Yes, please!",14.0,86,4,0.9996405212884997

11312,Native Flora 2014 Next Time Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light pretty red fruits mingle here, supported with tart citrus. It's an elegant, rather steely style, and one that needs aeration and a bit of patience. The best drinking window should be 2020 through 2025.",48.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997

11403,McManis 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"In Pinot Noir, you get what you pay for. Granted, MaManis's 2010 is a pretty simple wine.

11426,Calicaro 2008 Paris Mountain Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Direct and appealing now, like a cola drink infused with cherry and raspberry essence, with the caramelized, brown butter sauce complexities from oak barrel aging.

11468,Rex Hill 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fruity and forward, this is a pretty, approachable wine with bright berry and cherry fruit.

Spice and sharp acids add definition to the midpalate, and the careful barrel aging has introduced accent notes of nutmeg, licorice and black tea. Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish.",48.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
11499,Le Cadeau 2006 Equinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Le Cadeau's Equinoxe Cuvée is the winery's most limited offering, just 110 cases.

11505,Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2005 Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.",100.0,91,4,0.9996405212884997
11531,Melville 2011 Block M Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows intensely concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, with an earthy note of sweet beetroot and a dusting of exotic crushed hard spices.

11578,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The eponymous winemaker of this brand is based in San Francisco, from which, in this bottling, he turns out a stunner. Focused, intense, energetic and yet delicate, the nose is full of just-ripe raspberries, bay leaf, thyme, eucalyptus and chipped slate.

11639,Le Cadeau 2006 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle.

11646,Torii Mor 2006 Olson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The flavors are sappy and spicy and full, and the wine has a pleasing depth and richness. The fruits run through red and purple berries and lead into hints of chocolate and leaf. The winemaking is polished and confident, and yet Jacques Tardy has left just enough roughness in the flavors to give the wine personality and character.

11814,Orentano 2010 R. Buoncristiani Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Some unripe mushroom and leafy notes compromise this silky wine, along with richer flavors of cola. The alcohol is nice and moderate, but the cold vintage has taken its toll. Drink up.",38.0,84,4,0.9996405212884997
11849,Patz & Hall 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows good Sonoma Coast character in the tart acids and cool-climate flavors of pomegranates, cherries and cola.

But within that broad category, there are very few single-vineyard, Willamette Valley entries. Add this to the list.

Complex and refined, it has subtle power.",22.0,90,4,0.9996405212884997
11906,Phillips Hill 2012 Valenti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This has a red-brick rim, and mellow aromas and soft texture seem to confirm this is a mature wine that's ready to enjoy.

11935,Loring Wine Company 2006 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Keefer has not been Loring's most successful bottling.

12194,Lachini 2014 Prima Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012.

12218,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Outland Ridge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins.
