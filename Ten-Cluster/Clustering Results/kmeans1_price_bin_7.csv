7962,Falcone 2013 Mia's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins.",50.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
4506,Prime 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.",59.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
7957,Mt. Brave 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"The mountain appellation speaks loudly in this wine, contributing juicy blackberry, tar and leather, all within a forested context of wild truffle and crunchy leaves. Concentrated and robust in body and ripeness, it unwinds slowly in the glass, imparting jolts of black pepper as it goes.",75.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
5632,Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",80.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
5633,Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",80.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
7938,La Jota Vineyard 2013 Howell Mountain Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"This full-bodied, concentrated wine shows plenty of power in its bringing together of the variety with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. With a huge presence on the palate that lingers and stays in one's brain, it shows a reductive quality of toasted oak along with black pepper, bark and leather saddle,. It's a wine to enjoy from a giant leather chaise, if possible. Cellar until 2023.",85.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
5628,Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",89.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
9934,Beringer 1996 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",100.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
2777,Flora Springs 2008 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years.",100.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
8917,Nickel & Nickel 2014 State Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.",115.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
1306,Z. Alexander Brown 2013 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023.",120.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
1413,Quilceda Creek 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",125.0,99,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
5772,B Cellars 2009 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This Dr. Crane vineyard has really rocked in recent vintages. Enormously rich and deep, with a fabulous compaction of black currant, dark chocolate, baking spice and cedar flavors. There's an interesting grilled meatiness, like the charred fat on a great steak, and lots of new oak, but it's perfectly integrated. The smoky, toasty barrel notes are perfect companions to the fruit's power. Drink this 100% Cab now and over the next 12–15 years.",145.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
1318,Freemark Abbey 2013 Cabernet Bosché Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout.",150.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
1422,JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",150.0,97,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
7940,Robert Mondavi 2013 To Kalon Vineyard 50th Anniversary Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A wine marking the 50th anniversary of Robert Mondavi Winery's founding, this shows the grandeur of the man, the vineyard and the vintage. Full bodied and robust, it's intense in bark, tar and black licorice, with dottings of coconut. Aromatically inviting, it's dusty and soft, with acres of complexity and structure. Enjoy it in 2023 and beyond.",155.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
7953,Far Niente 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now.",155.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
7963,Hall 2013 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.",165.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
5773,B Cellars 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce. So beautiful now, it's hard to resist drinking it, but this lovely wine should improve for a decade, slowly developing in the bottle.",165.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
322,J. Davies 2012 Jamie Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022.",200.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178,above 40
