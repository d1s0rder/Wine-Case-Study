40152,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This young wine is all magnificent structure. It is intense, with fruit and acidity given richness by the powerful texture and tense tannins. The dense symphony of ripe fruits is kept in check by the structure. This wine needs many years; drink from 2019.",69.0,97,3,0.9437451803459469,above 40
40153,Domaine Pinson 2012 Cuvée Authentique Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Fermented and aged in six-year old wood for 24 months, this is a richly spicy wine. The wood is there to smell and taste, but it is the rich fruit that speaks. Yellow fruits are given weight by the mineral backdrop, while layers of acidity instill freshness. Drink this complex wine from 2018.",95.0,97,3,0.9608631291620379,above 40
110175,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Dense and beautifully ripe, this is a rounded rich wine. It focuses on the tropical yellow-fruit spectrum. That gives a full wine with wood-spice hints and just the right amount of citrus acidity to give it a lift. Drink this finely structured wine from 2023.",95.0,97,3,0.9571352615496442,above 40
102965,Cockburn's 2011 Vintage  (Port),"A complete wine, ripely fruity, firmly tannic and dense. It has weight and the right balance of fruit and structure. It's an impressive wine, powerful and concentrated while showing great fruitiness. The finish reveals its freshness.",95.0,97,3,0.9526250416866362,above 40
32621,Taittinger 2008 Millésimé Brut  (Champagne),"The balance between ripeness and acidity that is the hallmark of this fine vintage is expressed well in this impressive wine. Tangy, with a strong streak of minerality, it is crisp and rich at the same time. For its fruitiness, it is ready to drink; for more maturity, it will need to age until 2018.",95.0,97,3,0.947050809265898,above 40
102959,Quinta do Vesuvio 2011 Capela Vintage  (Port),"This is beautifully ripe and perfumed, packed with richness in the form of sweet berries and touches of spice. It's already a gorgeous wine, its ripeness lifted by the acidity and given shape by the tannic structure. This powerful wine shows great aging potential.",127.0,98,3,0.962491902138775,above 40
109831,Louis Jadot 2009  Corton-Charlemagne,"A hugely rich, powerful Chardonnay, layering ripe fruit with a core of tannic structure, acidity, wood and huge depth of flavor. The wine is concentrated, with layers of fruit and textured acidity. Of course, it needs aging—7 years at least.",130.0,96,3,0.9571367259053916,above 40
108402,Vignobles Brumont 2010 Château Montus La Tyre Tannat (Madiran),"From a beautifully exposed southwest facing vineyard with views of the Pyrenees, this is a serious and impressive wine. There is no holding back on the powerful structure and rich fruit or the dense texture and the layers of spice from the 16 months of wood aging. Balanced and generous, it will age for many years, and will best be drunk from 2022.",160.0,96,3,0.9571385193895376,above 40
24628,Louis Jadot 2014  Corton-Charlemagne,"This is a powerhouse of a wine—structured and dense yet still developing and closed at this young stage. There's already a sense of both fruit richness and mineral texture, underpinned by oak spice, yet it will grow more powerful with time. Drink from 2023.",184.0,97,3,0.9470448539457603,above 40
71400,Gosset 2002 Celebris Vintage Extra Brut  (Champagne),"Aged for 10 years before disgorging and a further time before release, this is Gosset's top wine from a great vintage year. Extra Brut means it is dry, although the age of this wine has softened the intense acidity and turned it into an elegant, mature wine of great complexity as well as immediate attraction. It will age further at least until 2022, although it is totally drinkable now.",195.0,96,3,0.9608640594611145,above 40
74170,Louis Roederer 2009 Cristal Brut  (Champagne),"The latest incarnation of this famous Champagne now comes from Roderer's own vineyards, a good portion of which are run on biodynamic lines. This still-young wine has great depth and richness, a beautiful balance between ripe fruit and crisp texture that make it alive, crisp and bright. As it matures, it will deepen and become even more intense. Drink now if you must, but preferably wait until 2019.",249.0,97,3,0.957133135352554,above 40
71396,Pol Roger 2004 Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut  (Champagne),"Following on from the great 2002 vintage of this wine, the 2004 is equally memorable. It is a magnificent wine, structured and beautifully balanced between the ripe white fruits and the tight texture that will allow it to age many years. While drinkable now, it is still young at 11 years, still with great potential. Drink now, until 2024, and probably beyond.",305.0,97,3,0.9526211875812834,above 40
14189,Château Haut-Brion 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.",330.0,97,3,0.9549926052390177,above 40
1416,Château Palmer 2009  Margaux,"A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style.",380.0,98,3,0.9549862106003109,above 40
48622,Château Mouton Rothschild 2013  Pauillac,"This generous, almost opulent wine has both concentration and rounded fruits. It's open already, hinting at wood-aging while concentrating much more on the ripe fruits. Packed with fruit and tannins, it's densely textured. It will age, of course; don't start to drink before 2025.",400.0,96,3,0.9571359867609522,above 40
5322,Domaine Leflaive 2008  Chevalier-Montrachet,"A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish.",550.0,97,3,0.9549913118370071,above 40
109271,Louis Latour 2015  Montrachet,"This opulent, powerful wine has weight, richness and a beautiful creamy texture. It's built to age, from its wood aging to its minerality. Concentrated, it offers yellow fruits shot through with acidity. From the grandest Chardonnay vineyard in Burgundy, it will age well and be ready to drink from 2026.",650.0,97,3,0.9499861871698878,above 40
110168,Château Haut-Brion 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024.",848.0,100,3,0.9608557106420945,above 40
48610,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"The production is tiny, yet the potential of this wine is enormous, with its tight, textured structure that is still so young. It is opulent and generous while still keeping a tight rein on its emotions. A steely core is surrounded by fruit that has hints of apricots as well as citrus. This will be a very fine wine but it needs many years, so wait until 2022.",932.0,97,3,0.9590854316934236,above 40
58427,Château Pétrus 2011  Pomerol,"This extravagantly perfumed wine has great juicy, ripe fruits. The tannic structure is almost secondary in the welter of ripe fruits, but it is enough to promise aging. Acidity and rich fruitiness partner each other to give a wine that is both fresh and powerful. Drink from 2020.",2000.0,97,3,0.9526257037942415,above 40
