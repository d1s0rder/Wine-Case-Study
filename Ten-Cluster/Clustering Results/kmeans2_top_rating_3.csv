32622,Kracher 2013 Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 5 Zwischen den Seen Scheurebe (Burgenland),"Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph.",95.0,97,3,0.9979774496351095
41066,Royal Tokaji 2013 6 Puttonyos Aszú Gold Label  (Tokaji),"This ethereal Tokaji Aszú is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot. The flavors come alive on the palate, showing luscious apricot, floral honeycomb and fresh pear juice. The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying.",80.0,97,3,0.9979774496351095
41076,Royal Tokaji 2013 5 Puttonyos Aszú Red Label  (Tokaji),"Straw colored with gold reflections, this delightful sweet wine has aromas of dried pear, fresh apricot and yellow peach. Flavors of fresh Bartlett pear, acacia honey and tinned apricots unfold on the palate. The finish is sweet, with just the right amount of acidity.",54.0,96,3,0.9979774496351095
53678,Hickinbotham 2013 The Peake Cabernet-Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.",150.0,96,3,0.9979774496351095
316,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",85.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
325,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",60.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
14130,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2013 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Blossomy pink-grapefruit perfume bursts from this fruity, floral, complex auslese. While lip-smackingly sweet with flavors of red berries and hibiscus nectar, it's grounded with a backdrop of acidity and steely minerality that resonates long through the finish.",52.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
14131,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2013 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Sheer in texture, this honeyed nectar falls on the palate like a whisper, but its stone fruit, red berry and grapefruit flavors are powerful and compounding. Multifaceted with touches of sugar cookie and guava juxtaposed with lime zest and slate, it delivers a long, ponderous finish.",50.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
14795,Lambert 2013 The Family Tree Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Rich, dense and intense, this is a big, muscular rendering of Barossa Shiraz. Scents of maple syrup and menthol intertwine with flavors of ripe plums and grilled meat. It's mouthcoating and long on the tannic finish, so give it some time in the cellar; drink 2020–2030.",65.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
34905,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",60.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
38987,Domdechant Werner 2013 Hochheimer Kirchenstück Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Wet slate and chalk penetrate through silken layers of honey, fig and dried apricot in this decadent beerenauslese. It's intensely concentrated in fruit, but also racy and taut, finishing with a flair of rose petals and pink grapefruit. Stunning now, but structured enough to develop beautifully for decades.",323.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
38993,Schloss Johannisberger 2013 Rosalack No. 398 Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"A standout amidst a stellar lineup of 2013 Rheingau auslese, this deeply concentrated, complex Riesling is a kaleidescope of sensory offerings. Pretty white floral notes perfume swathes of marmalade and crushed minerals. It's unctuous yet spine tingling, lithe yet endlessly penetrating on the finish.",160.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
39001,Robert Weil 2013 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA. The palate is persistent and pristine, awash in stone fruit flavors that pierce with laser-like brilliance. Delectable now for it's youth and fruitiness, but likely to develop mineral complexities for decades to come.",775.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
53685,Heartland 2013 One Red (Langhorne Creek),"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.",95.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
969,Schild Estate 2013 Moorooroo Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.",100.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
1309,Alves de Sousa 2013 Abandonado Red (Douro),"This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years. With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021.",85.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
4176,El Esteco 2013 Chañar Punco Red (Calchaquí Valley),"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.",68.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
4181,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Nicolas Catena Zapata Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.",125.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
4185,Casa Anadia 2013 Palácio Anadia Reserva Touriga Nacional (Dão),"Portugal's native Touriga Nacional originally comes from the Dão and this wine shows it in its glory. Planted around an ornate 16th-century palace, the vines have produced a richly structured wine, still showing some signs of wood aging. It is concentrated, with ripe red-cherry and blackberry fruits, solid tannins and acidity. Drink this wine from 2020.",50.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
7065,Cave Spring 2013 Riesling Icewine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"Smooth as silk and deeply concentrated, this outstanding icewine offers pressed apple, peach, pear, apricot and papaya fruit in a seamless, dense and immensely flavorful core. A streak of butter and honey carries it into a long, splendid finish.",60.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
