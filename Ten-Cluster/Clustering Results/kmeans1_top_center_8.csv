With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",45.0,91,8,0.9994698635153196
122,Delheim 2001 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure.

652,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),"Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset.",14.0,85,8,0.9994698635153196

888,Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",20.0,88,8,0.9994698635153196

1335,TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",12.0,86,8,0.9994698635153196
1344,Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors.

1361,San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character.

1718,Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",12.0,89,8,0.9994698635153196
1724,Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley),"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel.

1813,Rutini 2012 Trumpeter Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish.",11.0,84,8,0.9994698635153196
1822,San Felipe 2012 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Dry, spicy aromas aren't overly ripe or expressive. In the mouth, this basic Cab is raw, racy and spiky in feel.

2044,Viña Cobos 2007 Felino Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game.

2116,Viña Casas Patronales 2012 Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"Earthy, woody aromas suggest oak, coconut and coffee, while an herbal, olive note is also present.

2196,Cono Sur 2010 Visión El Recurso Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Leather, cheese, licorice, herb and tomato notes define the nose on this snappy, crisp Cabernet that's more racy and zesty than rich and deep.

2254,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2014 Los Vascos Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Aromas of cherry and currant are a bit flat. On the palate, this is perfectly good but common.

2456,Errazuriz 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.",12.0,87,8,0.9994698635153196

2685,Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity.

3122,Zolo 2015 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins.

3318,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity.

3380,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),"Herbal aromas of tomato leaf and earthy plum are a bit green.

This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver.

6807,Calama 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Mushroom and charcoal dot the nose, but with that comes just a modicum of fruit.

7130,La Playa 2005 Axel Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Minty and dusty at first, with secondary floral aromas that make you take notice.

7719,Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Chile),"Cherry and black olive aromas are common for standard Chilean Cabernet, which this is.
