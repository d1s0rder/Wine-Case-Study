26915,Joseph Phelps 2013 Insignia 40th Vintage Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),"The mighty Insignia shows a vibrancy of purpose and craft in this, its 40th vintage, combining 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Together they find a higher calling of perfumed violet, dark plum and berry along with graphite and an edginess of dried herb. Firm, structured tannins show tremendous potential for aging and decanting. This is a near-perfect effort from a blockbuster vintage.",250.0,98,2,0.9985205942544925
4056,Limerick Lane 2013 Rocky Knoll Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This wine is insanely good, from a dry-farmed, yes, rocky outcropping of vines planted first in 1910, then again in 1934 and the 1970s, with Carignane and Petite Sirah in the mix. It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently.",50.0,97,2,0.9985205942544925
14203,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Block B Paderewski Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine from Jordan Fiorentini is a stunning study in how to achieve extreme richness with elegance. Deep black cherry, violet, espresso, milk chocolate and vanilla pastry show on the nose. On the palate, chalky, soft tannins bring forth baked blueberry, star anise and clove flavors, with floral tones and acidic lift on the finish.",90.0,96,2,0.9985205942544925
26918,Horsepower 2013 The Tribe Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is aromatically brooding but precise, with notes of umami, black olive, smoked ham, crushed violets, funk and peat. The flavors are hefty and concentrated—with notes of fire pit and wet stone—while showing earth-shaking depth and intensity. The finish stretches out as long as you care to count. This is a complete knee buckler.",120.0,96,2,0.9985205942544925
41074,Portfolio 2013 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley),"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.",155.0,96,2,0.9985205942544925
50994,Terre Rouge 2013 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rhône-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030.",90.0,96,2,0.9985205942544925
2280,Trisaetum 2013 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length.",32.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
7937,K Vintners 2013 The Hidden Northridge Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Aromas of pomegranate, black fruit, herb and barrel spice lead to rich seamless palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It's hedonistic but retains a sense of balance along with an unabashed deliciousness.",70.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
13590,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Deliciously varietal in its huge offering of white pepper and robust black and blue fruit, this well-crafted wine boasts a lithe texture that invites sip after sip. It remains light footed throughout the palate, yet with enough complexity and balancing weight before the refined finish gives a final hit of juiciness.",50.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
24008,La Jota Vineyard 2013 Merlot (Howell Mountain),"The La Jota and W.S. Keyes vineyards are the sources for this classically styled wine that is intense and alive in minerality. Clove, black pepper and mountains of dried herb are front and center between firm, dusty tannin and oak. The texture is plush and velvety on the palate, with plenty of length on the finish.",85.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
24638,Law 2013 Sagacious Red (Paso Robles),"A testament to the power of Paso Robles' wines, this blend of 37% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 29% Syrah is dense, dark and viscous, showing candied blackberry, crème de cassis and pressed violet aromas, accented with cola and mocha notes. Soft, lush tannins massage the palate, growing grippier with time, while boisterous acidity releases blackberry, espresso and crushed slate flavors. Immensely likable now, it will also last for years.",70.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
26923,Horsepower 2013 Sur Echalas Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism.",120.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
26929,Cayuse 2013 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas are perfumed and expressive, with notes of crushed flowers, brown stems, black olive, sea salt, smoked meat and funk. The flavors are dense and intense, but still with a silky feel. It's a classic example of this producer, with a finish that just won't quit.",80.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
26935,Cayuse 2013 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Out of the gate this wine reveals quite savory aromas of stems, fire pit, soot, black olive and light flowers. The flavors are intense and tightly wound, showing a lot of structure along with elegance. It's a flat out stunner, showing grace and power as well as a hyper-extended finish.",105.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
28074,Dragonette 2013 MJM Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years. Drink now–2028.",75.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
28075,Shafer 2013 Relentless Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is a stunning, vibrantly robust and intense wine, big, bold and reductive and blended with 3% Petite Sirah. Floral aromas take on meaty, gamy overtones amidst black licorice, tar and juicy strawberry, the tannins silky and supportive and the finish leathery and spicy.",87.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
29867,Sineann 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Even by past standards, this new vintage of Sineann's Old Vine Zin is spectacular, with ripe, jammy, concentrated fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and purple plum. The balance among the fruit, acidity, tannin and alcohol is spot-on, without blowing away the more subtle compexity of the old vine fruit.",39.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
34904,Holus Bolus 2013 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Though this bottling is Peter Hunken's least-expensive Syrah, it gives his single-vineyard expressions a serious run for the money for best of vintage. Amazing aromas of chipped asphalt, smoked beef, dense boysenberry, soy, cedar, sandalwood and soy drop into a palate of peppery berry juice, beef jerky, underripe blackberry and elderberry, and pepper-crusted teriyaki beef.",32.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
41084,Vina Robles 2013 Suendero Red (Paso Robles),"This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg. A deep shade of mauve, the wine coats the glass and unleashes intense, lavish aromas of cassis, fig paste, mint and tarragon. It's as soft as it looks on the palate, where baked black cherry, roast beef, turned earth and lilac flavors ride luxurious yet firmly structured tannins.",56.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
43230,Sineann 2013 Riesling (Oregon),"This sweet, luscious, dessert-style wine keeps enough acidity to contrast and compensate for the sugar. There's nothing flabby here, but how sweet it is! Caramel apples, molasses, maple syrup and honey coalesce around concentrated fruits, ranging from citrus through tropical. Orange and peach, pineapple and papaya are all to be found. A half bottle is rich enough to satisfy four tasters.",24.0,95,2,0.9985205942544925
