4054,Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",155.0,98,4,0.9996405212884997
4057,Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.",115.0,97,4,0.9996405212884997
6571,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",70.0,97,4,0.9996405212884997
4058,Calera 2013 Reed Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"From a vineyard that Josh Jensen planted in 1975 comes this bottling that shows sultry black plum, minty herbs, tarragon, black slate, smashed mulberry and a touch of pork fat. A wondrous array of baked red and black fruit meet with clove, nutmeg, more tarragon and minty flavors on the palate too, producing delicious, dynamic flavor. It's like an expertly cooked stew of fruit, spice and herb.",70.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
4059,Wayfarer 2014 Mother Rock Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024.",115.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
4060,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle. Sultry baking spice accents kirsch and strawberry, with understudies of tar, rose garden and tannin, all framed by moderate acidity. Cellar through 2023.",90.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
4061,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024.",115.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
4064,Calera 2013 Jensen Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"A stunning range of black sage, fresh bay leaf, hearty mulberry, exotic cinnamon, raw beef and baking spice converge for a rugged yet pretty nose on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975. Elderberry and elderflower show on the sip, as do beet juice, dried ginger, crushed rocks, potting soils and a concentrated potpourri of purple flowers.",88.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
8890,Roark Wine Co. 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it outâ€”an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.",52.0,96,4,0.9996405212884997
324,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
2778,Hirsch 2007 San Andreas Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.",60.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
4066,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",72.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
4069,Byron 2013 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy. Intriguing river--stone minerality powers the palate, where black plums and olallieberries meet with black spice and lots of florality.",45.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
4072,Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way. Full bodied, it retains enough acidity to remain mouthwatering and yet complex, a subtlety of white pepper and cardamom biting at the its heels. Drink now through 2024.",90.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
4077,Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",50.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
5323,Copain Wines 2009 Monument Tree Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Outstanding. So dry and elegant, with such a deft, delicate texture, yet so explosive in fruit and spice. Bone dry, it has notes of herbs, cinnamon, raspberries and white pepper. A gorgeous, complex wine, one to think about and discuss.",50.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
5324,Copain Wines 2009 Wentzel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Brilliantly dry and rich in acidity, this Pinot feels very refined in the mouth. With relatively modest alcohol, it offers an elegant and refreshing alternative to the heavy style of many California Pinot Noirs. Offers notes of earth, cherries, mushrooms, spices and sweet sandalwood.",50.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7943,Walt 2014 Sierra Mar Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Sultry aromas of black plum, violet, lava rocks, smoke, caramelized beef, forest floor and star anise draw the nose into this hearty, well-rounded wine. There is both vibrant energy and tannic grip to the palate, with dense, dark cranberry, tangy fruit skins, a touch of vanilla and a minty fennel element on the finish.",75.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7945,Albatross Ridge 2014 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. There is great energy on the palate, with mulberry and elderberry flavors enhanced by light coffee, soil and fennel bulbs.",55.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
7951,Gary Farrell 2014 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus.",75.0,95,4,0.9996405212884997
