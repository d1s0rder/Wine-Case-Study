70103,Shea 2013 Shea Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Here is an utterly irresistible wine—spicy, sensuous and layered with beautifully ripened citrus, tree and tropical fruits. A whiff of pine needle continues as a flavor thread, along with vanilla, buttered nuts, lemongrass and macaroon. This wine just keeps on going.",35.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,20-40
76255,Thomas Fogarty 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"From one of the preeminent Chardonnay producers in the country comes their least expensive yet perhaps most stunning bottling, showing strong lemon rind, sea salt, Gravenstein apple and a floral touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The wondrously zippy and saline palate is framed by a grippy, grapefruit-rind-led tension, but opens just enough to allow the slightest hints of lemon curd and delicate marzipan warmth.",35.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,20-40
34906,Dehlinger 2013 Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a bright, effusive, estate-grown, unfiltered white, delineated by high-toned acidity and gorgeously floral aromatics. Planted originally in 1975 to heritage Wente clone Chardonnay by owner/winemaker Tom Dehlinger, its generosity of fresh apple and pear ride a voluptuous, balanced texture that's wholly satisfying, before meeting deeper hues of spicy, exotic tropical tones on the finish.",40.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,20-40
43231,Fairsing 2013 Chardonnay,"Stunning is the only word that does justice to this exceptional wine. It's fragrant and compelling, from the first sniffs of almond paste, butter cream and apple pie, right on through a magnificent palate loaded with well-balanced fruit, pastry and nut flavors. Rich, complex, and beautifully proportioned, it rolls into a seamless, toasty finish.",42.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
85149,Brick House 2013 Essence Chardonnay (Ribbon Ridge),"One large (500 liter) barrel was set aside with wine from a single acre of four interplanted and ungrafted Chardonnay clones. This is truly a natural wine, fermented with no additives, aged on the lees for 18 months, and bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deeply rich flavors of apple pastry, buttery barrel and sweet spice are ineffably long and seductive. This rare and exceptional wine should be consumed in its youth.",45.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
68366,Trisaetum 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This conveys a heady mix of luscious French oak, butter and toast, plus roasted nuts, a dash of Cognac, orange oil, apple sauce and baked pear.

It reflects the growing partnership between winemaker James Frey and Jacques Lardière formerly from Jadot.",49.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
98044,Sandhi 2013 Mt. Carmel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end.",55.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
85151,Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"An intensity of petrol-like oakiness on the nose of this wine suggests a youthful coiling that's yet to unravel. Still, plenty of promise is revealed, from robust yet floral elements of golden apple and honey to the effusive back notes of peach. Medium bodied, it finishes crisp and creamy, an expert combination of strength and elegance. Drink now through 2020.",55.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
85145,Joseph Phelps 2013 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This 100% varietal wine from the cooler outpost of Freestone is so deliciously crisp, bright in minerally lemon and fresh pear.

71399,Gary Farrell 2013 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate. But tameness comes in the form of lemon and grapefruit pith, brightening the load, with a sinewy structure supporting its core. The finish is succulent in honey and stone. Drink now through 2020.",55.0,96,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
70089,Domaine Serene 2013 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This is a sensational vintage for this cuvée, which is part of the winery's extensive Chardonnay lineup.

The finish lingers for several minutes, and the wine drinks as well or better on the second day it's been open.",55.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
68364,Sandhi 2013 Sanford & Benedict Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lime peels and lemon pith mix it up with rain on cement, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, ocean-spray saltiness and a lemon-pepper spice on the nose of this wine from the appellation's first vineyard. The palate is reminiscent of a perfectly restrained margarita, with the warmth of sea salt, the pungency of squeezed caviar limes and the body of lemon curds, topped with a sprig of mint.",55.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
7066,Ch.igai Takaha 2013 Samurai Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time.

75953,Blue Farm 2013 Laceroni Vineyard Estate Farmed Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine is the product of farming by Anne Moller-Racke and winemaking by Kenneth Juhasz, the original team behind Donum Estate in Carneros. Here, they've created a gorgeous, elegant expression of lemon zest and pear that harmonizes with stony minerality and brash, bristling acidity that becomes succulent on the palate. Atop it all is a scent of fresh-cut white flowers.",65.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
7047,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2013 Édition Limitée Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This reserve-level wine is down to just three barrels in this vintage.

38998,Bergström 2013 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"The Sigrid never fails to deliver lush fruit and hedonistic barrel flavors. However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well. This is a wine of power and finesse, with juicy pear and peach, supple acids, brioche and toasted biscuit, underscored with refreshing minerality. Drink now through 2025.",85.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
98049,Sandhi 2013 Bentrock Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is one of the most expensive white wines on the Central Coast, and it's mighty good, with aromas of cheese rind, lime pith, slate and tiny bits of Marcona almond and oak smoke. It's laser-focused on the chalky, mineral-laden palate, with poached apples in the midpalate and lemon peels and tangerine rinds throughout.",90.0,95,9,0.9789773061688091,above 40
