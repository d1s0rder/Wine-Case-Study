146,Casa Santa Vitória 2013 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano),"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018.",26.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095
200,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico),"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",20.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
316,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",85.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
325,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",60.0,95,3,0.9979774496351095
388,Vinos de Arganza 2013 Marqués de Montejos Selección Mencía (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Leathery berry and savory, smoky oak aromas are a rugged introduction to a stout palate with juicy acidity.

467,Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Made With Organic Grapes Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.",24.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095
490,Clos d'Argentine 2013 Winemaker's Selection Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky, charred aromas of blackberry and blackened spices set up a bold palate with energy to spare.

575,Luis Duarte 2013 Monte de Carrapatelo Colheita Seleccionada Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017.",30.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
579,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo),"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",23.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
580,Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro),"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",80.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
623,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",35.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095
669,Lagarde 2013 Henry Legarde Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.",17.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
739,Torbreck 2013 Cuvee Juveniles Red (Barossa Valley),"Built for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries. Drink now–2022.",22.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
745,Navardia 2013 Made With Organic Grapes  (Rioja),"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.",12.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
781,Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoss-Altenahr 2013 Trocken Früburgunder (Ahr),"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.",40.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095

847,Covila 2013 II Crianza  (Rioja),"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.",15.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
851,Finca del Marquesado 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good.",18.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
923,Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee),"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",25.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
929,Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina),"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",18.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
932,Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",16.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
939,Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño.

969,Schild Estate 2013 Moorooroo Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.",100.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
1077,Altos Las Hormigas 2013 Appellation Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity.

1181,Dr. Fischer 2013 Ockfener Bockstein Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Spine-tingling acidity runs throughout this off-dry Riesling. Swathes of honey and fresh apple, saffron and dried berries lend sweetness and warmth, but this striking kabinett does not surrender its sharp edges easily.",20.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
1197,Albet I Noya 2013 Brut Natural Reserva Sparkling (Penedès),"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage.

1199,Alta Alella 2013 Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense.

1263,Bodega Norton 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"This screaming violet-colored chunkster is big and blocky up front, with aromas of vitamins and grapy black fruits.

1280,Quinta do Vallado 2013 Sousão (Douro),"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",40.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
1309,Alves de Sousa 2013 Abandonado Red (Douro),"This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years.

1637,Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava),"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",15.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
1645,San Felipe 2013 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.",12.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
1655,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra),"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble.

1661,Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil.

1671,Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina),"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",25.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095
1672,Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",20.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095
1678,Alamos 2013 Red (Mendoza),"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.",13.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095
1682,Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",25.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095
1807,Felix Solis 2013 Flirty Bird Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean.

1831,Árido 2013 Sustainably Farmed Moscato (Mendoza),"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized.",12.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095
1833,Casa Rojo 2013 El Gordo del Circo Verdejo (Rueda),Melon and citrus aromas are yeasty and a bit sulfuric. This feels plump and juicy but not exact or well cut. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine turn bitter and salty on the finish.,17.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095
1945,Quinta da Padrela 2013 Premium Red (Douro),"The tannins are firm, still controlling the black fruits in this wine. It is concentrated, with considerable extraction giving a dry wine with a hard edge. The red-berry flavors are lost.",33.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095

2114,La Purísima 2013 Alphabet Wines Monastrell (Yecla),"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.",15.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
2158,Caves Transmontanas 2013 Vertice Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"This densely tannic wine is bold and linear, with concentrated chocolate and spice flavors.

2261,Koyle 2013 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"This opens with herbal berry aromas that are textbook Carmenère, but with airing a floral note comes in to accent black-cherry aromas.

2271,Apaltagua 2013 Envero Gran Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Initially, this Carmenère smells green and minty, with a heavy herbal blast.

2317,Terrazas de Los Andes 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth.

3400,Grove Mill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Wairau Valley),"This crisp, relatively light-bodied wine comes across as a bit lean in a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc context, offering hints of struck flint, grapefruit pith and underripe melon. Drink it over the next several months.",15.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
3404,Marqués de Cáceres 2013 Rosé (Rioja),"Cherry and raspberry aromas are fresh, clean and simple. A juicy, direct palate brings cherry and plum skin flavors with citric acid for cleansing purposes. This rosé is the definition of a simple summer quaffer.",9.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
3416,Wairau River 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor.

3539,Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar.

3620,Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",18.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
3622,Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",16.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
3628,Pedro Escudero 2013 Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping.

3648,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Curicó Valley),"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar.

3653,Bouza 2013 B2 Parcela Unica Tannat (Canelones),"Ripe earthy aromas of raisin and oaky vanilla open this heavy, saturated Tannat that displays jagged tartaric acidity and heat (15.5% ABV). Stewed berry, raisin and vanilla flavors finish full, tannic and chunky. All in all, this seems a bit overdone and overripe.",43.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
3692,Casca Wines 2013 Santos da Casa Red (Alentejano),"Blackberry jam aromas lead to a fruity wine, soft and juicy. Fresh and rounded, it has balanced acidity and an open, generous character. Drink now.",13.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095

3704,Artesana 2013 Tannat-Merlot-Zinfandel Red (Canelones),"Cherry-berry aromas are floral but also a bit furry and volatile. The palate on this uncommon blend feels fruity but also like grapeskins, meaning rubbery and pinching. Equally rubbery flavors of black plum and berry fruits turn mildly bitter on the finish.",16.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
3729,Quinta das Carvalhas 2013 Vintage  (Port),"Produced from a field blend of Douro varieties, and foot trodden in open granite fermenters, this is a wine that has an excellent future.

3780,Casas del Bosque 2013 Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Smoky, rubbery aromas of plum and foresty berry fruits turn damp and earthy with airing. This feels wiry, with tomato, herbal plum and boysenberry flavors. Barrel spice and toasty oak take over on the finish.",13.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095

3849,Caracol Serrano 2013 Red (Jumilla),"Leather and citrus aromas unleash a mild chemical note on the nose of this Monastrell-Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A solid palate with hard, poking tannins leads to cherry flavors that veer towards bitterness. This finishes woody, dry and slightly bitter.",11.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
3866,Santa Quiteria 2013 BT Bodega Tintoralba Garnacha Tintorera (Almansa),"Dusty strawberry and cherry aromas are modest and fruity.

4002,Gillmore 2013 Mariposa Estate Old Vines Dry Farmed Syrah-Merlot (Loncomilla Valley),"This dry-farmed Syrah and Merlot blend opens with foresty berry and black-olive aromas.

4176,El Esteco 2013 Chañar Punco Red (Calchaquí Valley),"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.",68.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
4181,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Nicolas Catena Zapata Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.",125.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095

4235,Raiza 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose.

4248,Tiza 2013 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Earthy slightly grassy infusions work their way onto a hot energetic bouquet. This feels racy, drawing and a bit clampy, while woody spicy flavors of rubbery berry fruits finish bold and hot like the beginning.",20.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
4369,Sierra Cantabria 2013 Selección  (Rioja),"Raspberry, plum and floral aromas are clean but nothing special or unusual. This basic Rioja feels sturdy and solid, while flavors of spicy oak accent plum and berry fruit. A medium-long finish with resiny, peppery notes is a touch hot.",12.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
4376,Herdade Grande 2013 Audaz Reserva Red (Alentejano),"This is a rich, ripe and full-bodied blend that includes Alicante Bouschet to give the dark color.

4420,Bodega Tacuil 2013 Viñas de Dávalos Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Salta),"Earthy, stewy aromas of baked berry and tree bark are typical for this winery. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is dense, layered and shows just enough acidity to stay upright.

4565,Trivento 2013 Amado Sur Torrontés-Viognier-Chardonnay White (Mendoza),"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits.

4755,Garces Silva 2013 Boya Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Tight, gritty, steely aromas of nettle and ocean mist allow for a modest amount of citrus fruit to poke through.

4829,Umathum 2013 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"With overtones of reduction, this wine needs a lot of air at first but then proceeds to show an elegant, supple and soft Zweigelt. There are welcome edges of white pepper and very supple, soft cherry fruit, creating elegance but no heaviness.

4885,TintoNegro 2013 Finca La Escuela La Arena Malbec (Mendoza),"Saucy, woody aromas of plum and berry are good but strained. This smacks down with high acidity and a sense of tomato. Salty flavors of tomato, herbs, red plum and currant remain salty on the finish.",30.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
4894,SignoSeis 2013 The Angel Oak Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush.

Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.",30.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
4968,Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras),"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",17.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095
4971,Cristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre),"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus.

4983,Terrai 2013 OVG Garnacha (Cariñena),"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",12.0,82,3,0.9979774496351095
4984,Bodegas Riojanas 2013 Puerta Vieja Blanco Viura (Rioja),"Wheaty and waxy on the nose, this Viura also smells of vinyl and corn.

4986,Trencalòs 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Chunky aromas of hay and mealy stone fruits are acceptable. This Sauvignon Blanc has a melony, creamy palate and mealy flavors of melon and papaya that match the bouquet.

5205,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2013 Chento Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp and furry on the nose, this is all tannins and scratch. High acidity only contributes to the grating mouthfeel, hence it's a bumpy ride where standard berry flavors are a sideshow. Chento 2012 is a better bet if it's still on the shelf.",20.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095

5236,Pittacum 2013 Tres Obispos Mencía Rosado (Bierzo),"Aromas of generic red fruits and children's vitamins are the greeting. This is chunky in feel, with light acidity that tries to keep things from coming across cloying. Candied flavors could use more dryness and elegance, while the finish is sweet and tastes of brown sugar and berry syrup.",23.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095
5237,Tilia 2013 Torrontés (Mendoza),"Generic, slightly soapy tropical fruit and cured-meat aromas smell oily. This is not flabby, with soft flavors of melon, papaya and lychee. A mild finish with some bitterness doesn't offer much snap or zest.",12.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095

5613,Fritz Haag 2013 Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Still stark and taut, this dry, delicately framed Riesling has beauty within its subtleties. Hints of lemon, lime, honey and blossom flutter on the palate against a backdrop of steely minerals and piercing acidity. It's subdued in its elegance, but should become more profound by holding until 2020–2022 for maturation.",42.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
5622,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro 2013 Madrigal Viognier (Lisboa),"Viognier in Portugal brings out the grape's ripe side along with layers of rich spice.

5828,Marqués de Vargas 2013 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero),"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar.

6411,Fire Road 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers.

6971,Markus Huber 2013 Berg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Very soft notions of ripe, yellow pear with floral overtones create a softer, luscious but completely dry palate.

8954,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2013 Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"While the nose is demure, suggesting only a hint of muted apple and pear, the sweet-tart palate on this spry wine is full of yellow-cherry flavor.

A distinct buttery flavor rides high on the finish.",11.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
9291,Carravid 2013  Ribera del Duero,"Earthy, medicinal cherry and leather aromas come in front of a tight, pointed, firm palate.

9468,Quinta de Chocapalha 2013 Branco White (Lisboa),"Viosinho, more often found in the Douro, dominates this ripe and full-bodied wine. Lemon acidity is integrated into the rich yellow fruit flavors to give smoothness and roundness. The intense fruit needs to soften a little, so wait until 2016 to drink.",15.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
9601,Bründlmayer 2013 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes.

9607,Markus Huber 2013 Alte Setzen Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Very ripe yellow pear mixed with punchy arugula create a contrast that makes this wine hard to put down.

9609,Nigl 2013 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),A beautifully subtle scent of Williams pear makes for a soft opening.

9747,St. Hubertus 2013 Chasselas (Okanagan Valley),"This crisp Swiss white grape is rarely seen in the U.S. and that's a shame.

9760,Dürnberg 2013 Ortolan Cuvée Prestive White (Niederösterreich),"Earthy yeastiness combined with soft lemon freshness creates a very savory wine. While the palate has umami-like spice, it also has a linear lick of clean lemon acid. The two work in contrast and will show their best with a mixed cheese platter.",23.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
9761,Dürnberg 2013 Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Lemon balm, peppery arugula and yeasty savoriness combine into a sleek, streamlined wine that goes down all too easily—notwithstanding its wonderful layers and length.

9964,Balduzzi 2013 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley),"Herbal berry aromas are dry and foresty, much like Loire Valley Cabernet Franc. This is superficially creamy and a touch sticky, but otherwise not that deep or dense. Leafy-berry flavors finish with notes of spice, olive and herbal berry. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Merlot is more old school than modern.",18.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095

10136,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2013 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),"Very subtle hints of blueberry emerge first, while on the palate they color both texture and flavor of this elegantly structured wine. Peppery spice tinges the aftertaste. This is fine-boned and defined, but with upright, well-bred poise and a subtle rather than in-your-face charm. Drink this now with game and venison or treasure it for another 3–5 years.",55.0,93,3,0.9979774496351095
10146,Weninger 2013 Kirchholz Alte Reben Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Fleshy cherry fruit becomes immediately apparent, while on the palate the fruit acquires a spicy edge of appetizing white pepper.

10158,Anko 2013 Torrontés (Salta),"Acrid and heavy on the nose, this is not showing any of Torrontés's floral, lighter qualities. Instead, this wine is slightly chemical and rough, with a blocky, citric palate and a mix of bitter citrus and pithy flavors.",14.0,82,3,0.9979774496351095
10246,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2013 Bernkasteler Graben Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Succulent yellow plums and cherries burst from each sip of this gloriously honeyed Riesling.

10247,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2013 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Bracing lemon and lime flavors are offset by streaks of luscious white peach and wildflower honey in this mouthwatering kabinett. While off dry and racy in style, it finishes long, enriched by creamy, lingering touches of hazelnut and cashew. Drinks gorgeously now, but has enough complexity and structure to evolve well through 2020.",32.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095

11587,Anakena 2013 Ona Special Reserve Riesling-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Leyda Valley),"Honey blossom and grassy aromas are all right, but struggle to offer much fruit.

18118,Ritual 2013 Alcaparral Syrah (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of citrus peel, rubber, spice, and iodine lead to a tight, drawing but full-feeling palate. This tastes herbal, spicy and oaky, with carob accenting black fruit and berry flavors. A minty, oaky, resiny finish closes this out.",20.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
18122,Maimai 2013 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"This is a medium-bodied, oak-inflected wine. Initial aromas of sun-warmed lumber and vanilla give way with air to scents of cola, earth and mocha. The overall impression is savory, especially on the long finish, which picks up some asphalt notes. Probably best with herb-crusted beef or lamb.",22.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
18188,Puramun 2013 Co Fermented Red (Valle de Uco),"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming.

18246,Hillinger 2013 Hillside Red (Burgenland),"Fleshy, primary notes of juicy, luscious plum have little shimmers of white pepper here and there. The palate is soft but not without structure, and the nature of this spells playfulness and fruity fun.",29.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
18247,Hutter 2013 Alte Point Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Earthy notes blend into hints of pear and yeast on the nose, while the palate puts more force on gentle peach and a concentrated, slender core with fitting, precise freshness.

18248,Kohl 2013 Kohloss Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),"Waves of crunchy, ripe red cherries on the nose mellow into cinnamon-spiced fruitiness on the palate.

18259,Vinos de Arganza 2013 Lagar de Robla Mencía (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Savory, spicy aromas of leathery berry, oak and graphite set up a medium-full palate that's dense, blocky and burly.

18298,Castelo de Medina 2013 Verdejo (Rueda),"Mild citrus aromas of grapefruit are offset by bready, leesy, yeasty scents. This has a citric mouthfeel with the suggestion of lime. Flavors of orange peel and gooseberry finish briny, with a puply feel.",13.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095

18401,Arrumaco 2013 Verdejo (Spain),"Yeasty, slightly stalky aromas of melon, citrus and peach are simple yet fresh. This feels solid, pulpy and fleshy, but not flabby; flavors of melon, papaya and white grapefruit finish pithy and slightly bitter. Drink immediately.",9.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
18403,Bodegas San Valero 2013 Particular White (Cariñena),"While this is largely neutral-smelling, it's flush in the mouth, with pithy citrus and green apple flavors.

18510,Hillinger 2013 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Fleshy plum notes rich with cinnamon set the tone on nose and lead to a big, bold and dense palate full of plum and black cherry fruit.

18515,Newton Forrest Estate 2013 Cornerstone Gimblett Gravels Red (Hawke's Bay),"This wine includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and (somewhat unusually) Malbec.

18595,Arboleda 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"Briny aromas of lime, jalapeño and minerals filter into a juicy, acidic palate with flavors that match the nose: briny citrus, lime and bell pepper.

18673,Herdade de São Miguel 2013 Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Alentejano),"With a touch of wood aging, this is a bright yet toasty wine.

18759,Streicker 2013 Bridgeland Block Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River),"Showing its age, but unfortunately not very well, this wine has lost any semblance of freshness, with notes of overripe lemons, stone fruit, pressed buttercups and buttered green beans. The palate is more attractive in its creamy texture, balanced by plenty of acidity. The finish once again descends into rather off-putting buttered green bean flavors.",28.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
18764,Ariano Hermanos 2013 Don Adelio Reserve Tannat-Syrah (Canelones),"Baked, earthy berry and herbal aromas turn murky and suggest animal as this breathes. A wiry, pulling palate with clipped acidity and hard tannins tastes of tart plum, tomato, herbs and grass. While the finish is shaken and stirred, it's not broken. This is Tannat and Syrah.",16.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095
18766,Alberto Orte 2013 La Antigua Clásico White (Rioja),"Chemical resiny aromas stand out more than fruit. This Viura-led blend feels tight, tangy and acidic.

18813,Juan Gil 2013 Honoro Vera Monastrell (Jumilla),"Earthy, medicinal plum and berry aromas are also a bit mulchy and leathery in character.

18894,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Curicó Valley),"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar.

18927,Basagoiti 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Spicy reedy cherry and red-plum aromas open this high-acid sizzler from a cool vintage.

19005,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Touriga Nacional (Douro),"The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.",40.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
19010,Santa Luz 2013 Gran Corte Red (Colchagua Valley),"A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry.

19464,Azamor 2013 Red (Alentejano),"For its alcohol, this is a surprisingly light and fruity wine. It does have tannins although they are subservient to the red berry fruitiness and freshness of the wine. It's balanced and aromatic, and could age further. Drink from 2017.",24.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
19556,Markus Altenburger 2013 Ried Satz Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"The nose just hints at white pepper and berries, while the palate confirms they are indeed there, but there is such slenderness, such fresh acidity amidst the ripe fruit that this wine comes across as simpler than it is.

19626,Espaço Rural 2013 Poento Branco Reserva Antão Vaz (Alentejano),"This is complex wine, still young, with intense fruitiness and a tight, tense structure.

31494,Maximo 2013 Edicion Limitada Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Mealy aromas of compostable white fruits lack freshness. This is high in acid but low on body. Briny flavors scream sauerkraut, while the finish tastes pickled and feels caustic.",9.0,82,3,0.9979774496351095
31505,Albet I Noya 2013 Petit Albet White (Penedès),"Like certain Rieslings, this smells a lot like gasoline. In the mouth, this Chardonnay-Xarello blend is narrow and scouring. Bitter, nutty flavors of generic white fruits finish waxy.",13.0,82,3,0.9979774496351095
31507,Garbó 2013 Negre Red (Montsant),"Herbaceous berry aromas blend with a strong scent of burnt coffee. Astringent and clampy on the palate, expect flavors that match the nose and a green, raw-feeling ending.",19.0,82,3,0.9979774496351095
31527,Callia 2013 Alta Pinot Grigio (Tulum Valley),"Light, citrusy aromas also are suggestive of bath soap. The feel is juicy yet innocuous, while flavors of tropical fruits finish mild and simple. This is the definition of a quaffing wine.",9.0,84,3,0.9979774496351095

31596,Fontes da Cunha 2013 Munda Touriga Nacional (Dão),"With 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a finely perfumed, ripe yet elegant wine. The wood aging still shows in the spice and vanilla, although this will certainly diminish as the wine ages further. This small production wine just needs a few more months and will be ready from 2018.",50.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
31666,Anton Bauer 2013 Vintage Blanc de Blanc Sparkling (Wagram),"A flinty note precedes touches of lemon on the nose.

31872,Markus Huber 2013 Alte Setzen Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Very ripe yellow pear mixed with punchy arugula create a contrast that makes this wine hard to put down.

31873,Nigl 2013 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),A beautifully subtle scent of Williams pear makes for a soft opening.

31888,Sattlerhof 2013 Sernauberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Grapefruit zest and chervil meet in a happy union that suggests riper fruit the longer this stays on the palate.

The finish is earthy and long.",40.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
31901,Quinta do Noval 2013 Cedro do Noval Red (Duriense),"The blend is concentrated and spicy due to Syrah. It is a rich wine, with Douro minerality and concentration, given freshness by the final acidity. Drink this ripe wine now.",24.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
31918,Tyrrell's 2013 Rufus Stone Shiraz (Heathcote),"This is meant to provide a counterpoint to the Tyrrell family's Hunter Valley offerings, but it retains similar sensibilities.

31939,Brokenwood 2013 Graveyard Vineyard Shiraz (Hunter Valley),"This wine was inadvertently tasted against a bunch of Barossa giants, so I may have underestimated it. It still held its own, delivering subtle notes of plum, cinnamon and clove, plus hints of olive and mocha. It's medium in body, with some herbal notes, yet finishes dusty and mouthwatering. Drink now–2028.",125.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095

32053,Loimer 2013 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Niederösterreich),"The nose signals crunchy, crisp red apple, which also follows through on the sprightly, wonderfully foamy and fresh palate of exquisitely small bubbles. This is light but full-fruited, brimming with all the crunch of Red Delicious and Braeburn apples supported by just a little shortbread richness from the yeast. There is concentration and poise, utter freshness and quite a bit of length.",32.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095
32054,Loimer 2013 Extra Brut Sparkling (Niederösterreich),"A lovely rich apple scent of Golden Pearmain pervades nose and palate of this fresh sparkler.

32121,Luigi Bosca 2013 Gala 4 Cabernet Franc-Malbec (Mendoza),"Aromas of red plum, herbs, smoky leather and toast crust unveil this Cab Franc with 5% Malbec. An expansive palate is the opposite of restrained, while this tastes earthy and spicy, with herbal cherry, plum and cassis flavors. A dry, composed, lightly herbal finish is a fine conclusion.

32252,Bodegas Tobía 2013 Selección Crianza  (Rioja),"Oak dominates the nose of this wine, leading to maple, molasses and mint aromas. It's broad and grippy on the palate, with herbal plum and toasty oak flavors. Its big, tannic finish is bold, but somewhat one-note.",22.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
32263,Eder 2013 Smaragd Traminer (Wachau),"An intriguing mix of pepper, rose petals, stone fruit and zesty lime creates a heady aroma. The palate is more toned down but all the more appealing for it. Rounded and concentrated, this is full of textural and aromatic interest. Ripe, washed-rind cheeses or spicy pan-Asian combinations would do this rich, layered wine real justice.",27.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
32272,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2013 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"Faint but appetizing notes of crunchy, red cherry are joined by white pepper on the vivacious nose. This is a serious red, but by no means a heavy one.

Medium bodied, it shows the elegant, spicy side of the variety without denying its lively, cherry-laden appeal.",25.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
32290,Jalits 2013 Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"Distant woodsmoke, ripe blueberry and notions of amarena cherry create an aromatic opening. The palate is toned and has an enticing, fresh-faced but sophisticated red cherry fruitiness in a taut structure. While this wine is concentrated, it also shows poise and a light-footedness. Elegance, aroma and finesse—all in one sip.",20.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
32341,Markus Molitor 2013 Ürziger Würzgarten Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Demure apple and pear aromas belie the intensely honeyed peach and tropical fruit flavors that burst from this feather-light nectar. A crush of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the sweetness, leading a long, laser-focused finish. Drinks well now, but will develop well through at least 2025.",25.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095

32358,Schloss Vollrads 2013 Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau),"Green floral notes and lemon zest perfume this pristine, pretty kabinett.

32550,Millton 2013 Opou Vineyard Riesling (Gisborne),"The warm climate of Gisborne, on New Zealand's North Island, isn't known for its Riesling, but this is a solid effort, as long as sweetness isn't an issue. Pineapple, peach and citrus flavors carry a hint of wet stone and deliver plenty of sugar (a reported 40 g/L), making it a strong candidate to pair with spicy Asian dishes.",30.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
32579,Lamadrid 2013 Single Vineyard Reserva Malbec (Agrelo),"Jammy berry and raisin aromas are compact and tell a lot about what's coming next. That's a saturated but rough and tannic palate with extremely ripe flavors of prune, licorice and blackberry jam. A peppery, syrupy finish is anything but lean.",20.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
32614,Marichal 2013 Reserve Collection Red (Canelones),"Pinot Noir blended with Tannat? Like it or not, here it is, and this unicorn wine from Uruguay smells cheesy and murky. A linear palate is not well padded, while this tastes earthy, like saucy plum and tomato.",20.0,81,3,0.9979774496351095
32622,Kracher 2013 Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 5 Zwischen den Seen Scheurebe (Burgenland),"Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph.",95.0,97,3,0.9979774496351095
32786,Viña Cobos 2013 Bramare Rebon Vineyard Malbec (Valle de Uco),"A fully ripe bouquet brushes up against raisin notes but pulls back. This feels juicy and full of life.

32789,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Andreza Grand Reserva White (Douro),The stupidly heavy bottle is off-putting. That's a shame as the wine itself is ripe and impressive.

32899,Angosto 2013 Almendros Red (Valencia),"This blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas. It's hard as nails on the palate, with drilling tannins. Rubbery, herbal blackberry flavors end with burnt toast, rubbery accents and a briny aftertaste. Best from 2017–2022.",40.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095

32957,Bodegas Ontañón 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Like most 2013s in Rioja, this smells gritty and earthy more than overtly ripe. A plump, slightly flat palate houses medium-ripe berry and plum flavors. A dry, peppery finish with moderate but present oak is solid.",16.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
32981,Gunter Triebaumer 2013 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland),"Candied lemon and rich blossom honey hit the brain with their lifted, intense scents. A touch of smoky stone can be glimpsed before the sweetness of the palate takes over. Here, a pleasantly bitter note edges the richness with welcome texture and bite. Candied-citrus notes swish across the palate, trailing blossom, honey, nectar and candied peel in their wake. The finish is fresh and clean.",35.0,94,3,0.9979774496351095
33009,Flam 2013 Rosé (Judean Hills),"Medium blush in color, this wine has aromas of guava, melon and strawberry.

33017,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2013 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid.",33.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
33022,Bastgen 2013 Kestener Paulinshofberg Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Whiffs of sage and brush lend an herbaceous quality to this vivacious wine. Apple cider and honey tones are bright and sweet, accentuated by puckery lemon-lime acidity.",23.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
33142,Netzl 2013 Cuvée Red (Carnuntum),"Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic. Merlot adds riper fruit while Blaufränkisch contributes more pepper and structure. This is a very harmonious blend. Lovely now but with the mileage to last a number of years in the cellar. Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020.",17.0,91,3,0.9979774496351095
33175,Urlar 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Wairarapa),"This medium-bodied wine features plenty of pungent, boxwood-like scents and musky, herbal flavors. Thankfully, there's enough melon and fig to compensate and the wine finishes with a pleasant touch of anise.",20.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095

33274,Markus Huber 2013 Auslese Riesling (Niederösterreich),"A closed nose opens into a light-bodied, citrus-led palate of mild sweetness, with that lovely killer acid that is Riesling's own.

33288,De Martino 2013 Viejas Tinajas Cinsault (Coelemu),"From old dry-farmed vineyards in the southern Itata Valley, this amphorae-fermented wine is one of Chile's most unusual reds. It's muscular and medicinal on the nose, with earthy, rubbery scents. Flavors of mushroom and dusty berry lack pointed freshness, while the finish is lively and earthy, with a plum character. This is unique but the final product has its faults. Tasted twice.",25.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095

33421,Leindl 2013 Zöbinger Heiligenstein Riesling (Kamptal),"Distinct dried pear, apricot and sultana notes signal some evolution in this wine. The same, rich dried fruit notes are accented with zesty grapefruit freshness on the dry, concentrated palate. It finishes with pithy bitterness and a moreish streak of lemon. Rather advanced for the vintage but still evolving. Drink now–2022.",43.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095
33532,Loscano 2013 Capriccio Reserve Blend Red (Mendoza),"Cool herbal aromas of blackberry and cola are minty. This feels narrow, with hard tannins that aren't ready to reconcile now.

33553,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Red (Tejo),"Dominated by Touriga Nacional at 60% with the addition of 40% Syrah, this is a ripe, fruity wine.

33556,Echeverria 2013 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Plum, black cherry, sandalwood and spice aromas work well together. This feels well balanced. Spicy, minty plum and berry aromas are common for Carmenère, while a chewy finish is smooth and not demanding.",13.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
33572,Adega Mãe 2013 Dory Red (Lisboa),"A blend of Touriga Nacional, Aragon and Syrah, the wine is open, generous and almost ready to drink. It has some firm tannins along with lifted acidity. The black currant fruits are fresh, right up front and give the wine its delicious fruitiness. Drink from late 2016.",14.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
33767,Nacido del Quórum 2013 3 Meses en Barrica Monastrell (Jumilla),"This was aged but three months in oak, but it smells and tastes woody. Char, resin and toasty blackberry and black plum aromas lead into a resiny palate with charred flavors of black cherry and plum. Burnt, bitter notes rise up on the finish.",12.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
33903,Falernia 2013 Pedriscal Vineyard Reserva Carmenère (Elqui Valley),"Murky, mulchy aromas of baked black fruits and coffee grinds set up a gritty, hard palate of barrel char and roasted berry fruits.

37372,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium 2013 Fritz Willi Riesling (Mosel),"A whiff of fennel lends spice to pristine, tart peach and yellow plum flavors in this pert off-dry wine. Ideal as an apéritif, it's brisk, lean and refreshingly juicy.",17.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095
37412,Montebro 2013 Vilamar Reserva Reerva Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Terra Alta),"Candied, oaky aromas of clove outmuscle foxy berry scents.

37680,Coto de Hayas 2013 Fagus Selección Especial Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"Right from the start, this is all about oak and not about quality fruit, balance or subtlety. Aromas of wood resin, milk chocolate and char lead to a rugged rough palate. Flavors of burnt wood and stewed fruit finish resiny. Year after year, Fagus smells and tastes like this: it's time for a reboot.",21.0,81,3,0.9979774496351095
37687,Autoritas 2013 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Plum and berry aromas are leathery and solid. This feels a bit wiry, but full of energy and sharp acidity.

37719,Matarromera 2013 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Ripe cherry, cassis, animal and smoke aromas are staunch. Saturated, drawing and highly tannic now, this needs age.

37858,Caves Aliança 2013 Alabastro Red (Alentejano),"Along with the typical warmth of an Alentejo wine comes an earthy character that is less attractive. There are juicy rhubarb and redcurrant tones, but they are engulfed by its rustic character. Drink now.",8.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095

38182,Jurtschitsch 2013 Löss Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Aromatically, this wine does not want to give too much away yet.

38450,Bellingham 2013 The Bernard Series Bush Vine Pinotage (Coastal Region),"Graphite, char, vanilla bean and cedar plank lay atop the black berry and plum preserve fruit core on the nose.

41998,Carmelo Patti 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),"Aromas of tire rubber, black cherry and citrus peel are tight and closed. This feels dry and tannic, with little give. Dark-berry flavors come with a dash of salt, while this remains salty and feels dried out on the finish.",33.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095

42894,Magnum Vinhos 2013 Maria Mora Red (Alentejano),"This is a dense wine with firm tannins and a solid structure. The black currant fruits are stalky and still developing, along with the acidity.

43678,Ressò 2013 Garnacha (Catalunya),"Loamy, earthy aromas of raspberry and raisin fall flat as this breathes. A heavy palate is low on freshness and acidity, while prune, cherry and cassis flavors veer toward raisin on a finish that quickly loses clarity and snap.",8.0,83,3,0.9979774496351095

47999,Ridgeview Estate 2013 Fitzrovia Rosé Sparkling (England),Very slight notes of elderflower play around the crisp apple fruit.

48220,Yaffo 2013 Sauvage Red (Judean Hills),"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of fruits of the wood with a hint of roasted tomato.

48644,Greywacke 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs.

48723,D'Arenberg 2013 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale),"This wavers from the classic Australian recipe of dry Riesling to offer something with a touch of residual sugar (13.6 g/L). Notes of crushed stone, pineapple and lime are buttressed by tart acids, while the sugar helps to balance the finish.

49699,Falernia 2013 Reserva Malbec (Elqui Valley),"If you know Falernia and Elqui, then this fits the mold. If you don't, you'll probably find this Malbec to be weird or unlikable.

50980,Attis 2013 Nana Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Aromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own.",32.0,81,3,0.9979774496351095
50981,Bodegas Hnos. Pérez Pascuas 2013 El Pedrosal  (Ribera del Duero),"Woodsy, spicy top aromas announce plenty of oak, which is confirmed by minty notes. In the mouth, this is raw and clamping—harsh in a word. Sour, pinchy, leafy flavors are herbal and underripe. A hard-tannin finish is grating.",26.0,81,3,0.9979774496351095
51023,Clos Henri 2013 Petit Clos Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A French-owned outpost in the South Pacific, Clos Henri seems to be finally coming of age. This entry-level offering delivers a hint of smoky, fumé character, but also plenty of ripe fruit, ranging from fig, melon and stone fruit to zestier notes of passion fruit.

51071,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2013 Vintage  (Port),"From a very fine Port vineyard, this is an attractive wine from what is not a great Port vintage. It has perfumed fruits and gentle tannins that give a red fruit character to the wine. The wine is in a style that can almost be drunk young for its fruit, red plums and dried raisins spiced with acidity and a easy structure. Drink now, although for the true vintage Port experience, wait until 2025.",125.0,90,3,0.9979774496351095

There's an immediately attractive richness to the nose, thanks to upfront notes of beeswax, honeysuckle, Asian pear, yellow apple and a touch of guava. The medium-weight mouthfeel is surprisingly direct and clean, with tart white fruit and pure citrus tones that carry through to the bright finish. Drink now–2018.",16.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
51099,Val do Sosego 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Apple and stone fruit aromas are fresh and direct, not wayward, leesy or creamy.

51256,Solar de Castro 2013 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja),"Aromas of minerally pencil lead and smoky plum and berry are positive albeit oaky. This is tight and grabby in feel, with firm tannins.

51624,Gimenez Riili 2013 Padres Dedicados Malbec (Mendoza),"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla.

Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.",150.0,96,3,0.9979774496351095
53685,Heartland 2013 One Red (Langhorne Creek),"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated.

56673,Ara 2013 Pathway Single Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a crisp, tightly focused offering, but one that doesn't lack fruit.

56768,Steindorfer 2013 Pinot Gris (Burgenland),"A rather closed nose and tightly-wound aromatics suggest that this will take time to reach its peak.

56899,Lagar de Besada 2013 Baladiña Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Peachy aromas are less than perky, while in the mouth this is lemony, narrow and citric. Flavors of lemon and tangerine finish with stony mineral notes but also a drawing citric acidity.",16.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095
57015,Turasan 2013 Kalecik Karasi (Turkey),"A nose of black cherry, cocoa and juniper berry paves the way for flavors of tart cherry, white chocolate, cocoa and orange zest.

57094,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2013 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Blueberry, blackberry, smoke and white pepper unite to create a mysterious, almost brooding impression.

The finish turns away from darker fruit and ends on ripe, red cherry.",45.0,93,3,0.9979774496351095
57097,Jäger 2013 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Very ripe notions of pineapple and soft banana are coupled with a fresh, clean earthiness.

57098,Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 St. Laurent (Thermenregion),"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and orange peel insinuate themselves on the pure red cherry fruit. The palate remains refreshingly slender, unadulterated and perfectly balanced. This is subtle and understated and thus allows the moody and mutable St. Laurent fruit to change its expression as constantly and quickly as stormy clouds.",20.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
57112,Paul Achs 2013 Edelgrund Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"White pepper in a fortuitous blend of blueberry and blackberry creates an inviting nose.

57229,Montebro 2013 Vilamar Reserva Reerva Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Terra Alta),"Candied, oaky aromas of clove outmuscle foxy berry scents.

58311,Quintay 2013 Clava Coastal Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Crisp, spicy, grassy, citrus aromas are all good.

58362,Calcu 2013 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Colchagua Valley),"Briary and rubbery smelling, this also shows aromas of leafy herbal plum. Fairly pinched and tannic, this delivers a raw mouthfeel.

58607,Lapostolle 2013 Casa Grand Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),"Gritty apple and matchstick aromas are not overly stable.

59716,Bodegas Aragonesas 2013 Dom Ramon Imperial Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"Cherry and black plum aromas are oaky and smoky. Full, blocky and a bit awkward on the palate, this Garnacha tastes of minty, oaky clove, roasted plum and black currant. A saucy, semi-oaked finish is solid enough.",9.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
59741,Bodegas Aragonesas 2013 Don Ramón Vino Tinto Barrica Red (Campo de Borja),"A mellow, mildly fruity nose is like a cypher. This feels limited but healthy and compact.

60602,Marqués de la Concordia 2013 Vega de la Reina Hacienda Zorita Verdejo (Rueda),"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla.

60607,R&A; Pfaffl 2013 Hundsleiten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"The nose is subdued and rounded, while some green pear aromatics play on the palate of this mild wine.

60792,Paco & Lola 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Dusty peach and apple aromas fold in stony mineral notes as well as leesy scents. This feels solid, properly acidic and a bit pulpy. Flavors of apple cider and peach pit finish with citrusy acidity.",22.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
60841,SignoSeis 2013 The Angel Oak Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.",30.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095

61022,Puramun 2013 Co Fermented Red (Valle de Uco),"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming.

Drink now.",45.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
61122,Luigi Bosca 2013 Finca Los Nobles Malbec Verdot Field Blend Malbec Blend (Luján de Cuyo),"Dense woody aromas come with notes of damp earth, coffee grounds and eucalyptus nut. On the palate, this blend of Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot is high in acidity but also resiny from oak treatment. Salty plum and tomato flavors give way to a tidal wave of oak flavor on the finish. Drink through 2025.",95.0,89,3,0.9979774496351095
61124,Bratanov 2013 South Sakar Selection Merlot-Syrah (Thracian Valley),"A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Syrah this garnet-colored wine has aromas of bright cherry, blackberry and dried oregano.

61266,Juan Gil 2013 Dry Muscat (Jumilla),"Yeasty, floral aromas fold in notes of citrus and apple. This is more lifted and fresh than the newer 2014, which was a warmer vintage. Flavors of citrus and tropical fruits turn more yeasty and bready on the finish.",11.0,86,3,0.9979774496351095

61397,Casa de la Ermita 2013 Dulce Blanco Macabeo (Jumilla),"This almost colorless sweet wine is made from Macabeo, not your most expressive grape variety. Aromas are funky and cheesy, with a low-acid palate that's on the flabby side, while creamy vanilla and caramel flavors don't allow for much fruit to shine through.",20.0,85,3,0.9979774496351095
61432,Sierra Cantabria 2013 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja),"Aromas of cola nut, bacon, blackberry, licorice and wood smoke announce a raw rugged palate that's not nearly as plump and lush as it normally is: a clear reflection of the cool 2013 vintage in Rioja.

61683,Pegasus Bay 2013 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Waipara Valley),"On the one hand, this wine seems almost honeyed, broad and rather lush.

61841,Kalfu 2013 Sumpai Huasco Valley Sauvignon Blanc (Chile),"Yeasty vanilla and mild vegetal aromas lead the way on this otherwise neutral-smelling SB. The palate is lively but more generic than specific; flavors of bell pepper and asparagus dot the picture, with lime and grapefruit also apparent. A salty, briny finish may stem from the ground water used to irrigate this desert-origin new SB.",22.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
61862,Cellar Hand 2013 Free Run White (Okanagan Valley),"A second-label for Black Hills Estate Winery, this little gem overdelivers in every regard.

61883,Hunky Dory 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Pungent and sweaty, this makes an immediate impact on the nose. That vibrancy carries over onto the plushly textured palate and electric, mouthwatering finish. A fun, flashy wine for near-term consumption.",16.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
61909,Nobilo 2013 Regional Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Nicely ripe for an entry-level wine, with stone-fruit shadings to the gooseberry and grapefruit notes. A subtle leafiness helps balance a slightly honeyed feel on the palate. Easy to drink.",13.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
61963,Koyle 2013 Royale Tempranillo (Colchagua Valley),"While there are few varietal Tempranillos made in Chile, this one is mostly positive. On the nose, this is dark, with a chocolaty crust along with patented Los Lingues aromas of olive and herbs. A choppy palate is high in acidity, while flavors of heavy oak, vanilla and herbal plum finish peppery, spicy and scratchy in feel.",26.0,88,3,0.9979774496351095

62108,Gaia Wines 2013 Notios White (Peloponnese),"The Notios blend offers aromas and flavors of pert lemon, sea salt and spice, with an attractive acid balance. Focused and fresh but with some complexity, it's a god expression of Greek terroir and style.",17.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
62114,Quinta da Raza 2013 Dom Diogo Arinto (Vinho Verde),"This is a wine that shows a more serious side to Vinho Verde. Bone dry, with a crisp and creamy texture, it has citrus, pineapple and red apple flavors. It could even age a few months, but is so drinkable now.",13.0,87,3,0.9979774496351095
62139,Hillinger 2013 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Fleshy plum notes rich with cinnamon set the tone on nose and lead to a big, bold and dense palate full of plum and black cherry fruit.

62143,Glatzer 2013 Altenberg St. Laurent (Carnuntum),"Aromatic red cherries lifted with appetizing notes of pine forest glisten on the nose and frame the palate.

62152,Te Mata 2013 Bullnose Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"Te Mata's Bullnose doesn't receive nearly the media attention of its flagship Coleraine, but it's a benchmark for Hawke's Bay Syrah—the violets and pepper on the nose couldn't be mistaken for any other variety. This is a bit creamy in texture on the midpalate but not weighty at all, more agile or spry, with a fine, silky feel on the finish. Drink now–2023.",40.0,92,3,0.9979774496351095
62167,Chilensis 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Merlot (Maule Valley),"Raw, earthy plum aromas are spicy and lightly herbal. This feels saucy yet monotone.
