3500,Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture.

6805,Zenaida Cellars 2000 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"It's too hot for Pinot Noir in Paso Robles, right? This wine shows why. It's not bad, but clumsy, with heavy, earthy flavors. It lacks delicacy and subtlety, which is what Pinot Noir is all about.",20.0,83,6,0.597505703236952

41527,Del Dotto 2011 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"The vineyard produces everything from Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc to Chardonnay and Syrah for the winery, with generally good results. This Pinot shows the exotic notes of wildland herbs and pine that so often show up in Fort Ross-Seaview Pinots. But it's also rich in cherries, and the acidity is just about perfect.

64743,Kramer 2007 Port Pinot Noir,"A Pinot Noir Port is a rare creature, and somewhat contradictory.

101508,Inocencio 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Heavy for a Pinot Noir, it's almost unrecognizable. While it is a nice, rustic red wine, dry and spicy, with lots of berry fruit, it's just not particularly Pinot-esque.",42.0,85,6,0.5663109962322279

76701,Weingut Burg Ravensburg 2007 Noir Dry Pinot Noir (Baden),"This is a blend of 85% Pinot Noir and 15% Lemberger—and yet the Lemberger is the dominant grape. The color is dark, the aromas and flavors are chunky and less nuanced than pure Pinot Noir, and the tannins are ripe but lack the silky character of Pinot. It's a solid, robust red that would make a nice match for burgers and the like.",19.0,88,6,0.5657807496918333

49248,Robert Mondavi 2001 Private Selection Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"It's Pinot-esque in the cherry and raspberry flavors and light, silky tannins, which make for easy drinking.

54016,J Vineyards & Winery 2012 Misterra Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews.",50.0,89,6,0.5635003527523936
19558,Ostler 2011 Caroline's Pinot Noir (Waitaki Valley),"Waitaki Valley is an increasingly popular region for Pinot Noir, although the number of producers is quite small.

37644,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a sort of junior version of Swan's awesome Trenton Estate Pinot.

20569,Longboard 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Longboard shies away from overt fruit in favor of earthier tobacco flavors in this dry, complex and tannic young Pinot Noir.

Drink now–2019 as it gradually sheds fruit.",33.0,91,6,0.5492471258084884
6571,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",70.0,97,6,0.5487735987952809
