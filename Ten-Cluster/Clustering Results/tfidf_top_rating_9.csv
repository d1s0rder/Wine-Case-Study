105756,Failla 2010 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying. Winemaker Ehren Jordan suggests pairing it with simple fare like roast chicken and salted fingerling potatoes.",44.0,99,9,0.3158780544949541
37384,Dolce 2006 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.",85.0,98,9,0.30902875788473494
74747,Foxen 2010 Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.",32.0,96,9,0.41685441607024776
42385,Dolce 2007 Late Harvest Wine Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% Sémillon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc.",85.0,96,9,0.3684201534644675
105764,Lynmar 2010 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish.",50.0,96,9,0.34447522510178513
60018,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2006 Berncasteler Doctor Beerenauslese Goldkap Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"The wonderful minerality imparted by the Doctor vineyard is somehow able to keep this intensely sweet, rich wine from being heavy or cloying. Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",160.0,96,9,0.34075171128748477
42387,Williams Selyem 2010 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",65.0,96,9,0.3386824300443436
37389,Macauley 2007 Special Selected Late Harvest Botrytis Sémillon (Alexander Valley),"This is one of the best dessert wines available from California. It's dazzlingly rich and sweet in orange jam, apricot, honey, buttered cinnamon toast and créme brûlée flavors. The intense sweetness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, and the wine despite its sweetness accomplishes the miracle of finishing dry and clean. The grapes are 100% Sémillon.",45.0,96,9,0.33644590327422225
41076,Royal Tokaji 2013 5 Puttonyos Aszú Red Label  (Tokaji),"Straw colored with gold reflections, this delightful sweet wine has aromas of dried pear, fresh apricot and yellow peach. Flavors of fresh Bartlett pear, acacia honey and tinned apricots unfold on the palate. The finish is sweet, with just the right amount of acidity.",54.0,96,9,0.33075883685752056
42388,Williams Selyem 2010 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The acidity really makes this Chardonnay come alive, providing vitality, a quality that's boosted by an undercurrent of minerals. It's so rich in tropical fruit, orange, nectarine and pear flavors, and so generously oaked, which brings a sweet, satisfying note of buttered toast, that all you want to do is drink it now, preferably with steamed lobster and melted butter.",50.0,96,9,0.32240085043234246
76126,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Ethos Late Harvest White Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is just this side of unctuous, a decadently ripe and rich late harvest Riesling. The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey. Apart from the winery's Single Berry Select Trockenbeerenauslese project with Ernie Loosen, this is the best dessert wine made in Washington.",40.0,96,9,0.32189046444963265
40898,Boekenoogen 2007 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering.",34.0,96,9,0.3044317064252736
52227,Paul Hobbs 2010 Edwards James Estate Wente Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There isn't a Chardonnay out there as rich, opulent and delicious as this one. It dazzles with tropical fruit, pear, peach, green apple, honey, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Brisk, lime-driven acidity provides beautiful balance. It's oaky, but the smoky, buttered-toast and butterscotch notes are nearly perfect. Drink now with rich crab, lobster or scallop dishes.",75.0,95,9,0.4187832435204889
52224,Paul Hobbs 2010 Edwards James Estate Bato Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a Chardonnay for red wine lovers. It's full bodied and oaky, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Airing brings out sweet honey, orange jam, apricot and tropical fruit favors, yet the acidity and minerality also develop, providing balance. The oak develops too, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes bringing additional richness.",75.0,95,9,0.4097452016975944
90982,Williams Selyem 2008 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",50.0,95,9,0.3879039364758562
43230,Sineann 2013 Riesling (Oregon),"This sweet, luscious, dessert-style wine keeps enough acidity to contrast and compensate for the sugar. There's nothing flabby here, but how sweet it is! Caramel apples, molasses, maple syrup and honey coalesce around concentrated fruits, ranging from citrus through tropical. Orange and peach, pineapple and papaya are all to be found. A half bottle is rich enough to satisfy four tasters.",24.0,95,9,0.35202386799165314
84412,Rochioli 2010 Sweetwater Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"One word describes this Chardonnay: fabulous. It's really everything a California Chardonnay can deliver. Ripe tropical fruit, pear, green apple and honey flavors are wrapped into buttery, smoky oak. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity and a touch of minerals, showing its pedigree with every nuance. Drink soon, to enjoy its youthful beauty.",60.0,95,9,0.3462651920197419
90987,Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",25.0,95,9,0.3453522750115279
68938,Prinz Salm 2011 Berg Roxheim Erste Lage Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Nahe),"Scents of sweet spice and orange marmalade waft exuberantly from this honey-kissed TBA. Lusciously sweet, the palate undulates with waves of mango, melon and pineapple flavor, accented with notes of potpourri and saffron. Lingers long with a shower of delicate acidity.",237.0,95,9,0.33902238388621425
98010,Nicolaysen Family Vineyards 2001 Late Harvest Alisos Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County),"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",50.0,95,9,0.3272416702183274
