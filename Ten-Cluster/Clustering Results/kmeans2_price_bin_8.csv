66100,Navarro 1997 Late Harvest Cluster Select White Riesling (Anderson Valley),"Old-gold in color, and thick and syrupy. The aromas run to caramel, apricots, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan pie and crème brûlée. Tastes as voluptuous as it smells. Fantastic concentration and depth; a nectar bursting with sweet, gorgeous fruit. The acidity is high, but it feels soft and creamy. Residual sugar of 28% makes it tooth-achingly sweet. Only 554 cases produced, but worth the search.",25.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235,20-40
66102,Beringer 1996 Nightingale White (North Coast),"Decades ago, Beringer’s then-winemaker Myron Nightingale created an artificial method of introducing the botrytis to Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, with great results. This splendid version has strong aromas of crème brûlée, vanilla custard, honey, apricot purée and a warm note of peach pie fresh out of the oven. The taste is, in a word, fabulous. This is a nectar fit for the gods.",30.0,93,8,0.9861271836406683,20-40
15055,Ledson 1998 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"This is one of the most interesting Merlots of the vintage because it combines fruity ripeness with herbal and vegetal notes to create a complex wine. Blackberry and cassis, a bit of stewed tomato and mushroom, grilled meat, green olives and roasted coffee beans only begin to describe it. Dry and harmonious.",34.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905,20-40
9938,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1997 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now.",35.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235,20-40
15051,"Terre Rouge 1999 Sentinel Oak Vineyard, Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))","Hang onto your hat; here's a very great Syrah. The aromas are hiding, now suggesting plum and blackberry, now black pepper, now freshly baked rhubarb pie. In the mouth, it knocks out with grace and power. It's soft as silk, but complex and layered, and the richly tannic finish suggests aging potential. Not too long, though.",35.0,94,8,0.9795773347375224,20-40
94329,Io 1997 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier. Opens with brilliant, beautiful aromas of berries and fruit, chocolate, violets, herbs and spices, and smoky oak. In the mouth, there's fabulous complexity and an opulent, velvety smooth texture. Very dry and elegant, and the sweet, spicy finish goes on forever.",40.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235,20-40
48099,Flora Springs 1997 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"With a sweet core of cherry fruit, plenty of tobacco and coffee nuances and other fine touches, this meritage blend hits the right chords and shows just the right weight. Deep, handsome, and fairly seamless; some light oak is applied skillfully, and in general the final product sings a pretty song.",45.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
94328,Leonetti Cellar 1998 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"If this isn't the best $50 Merlot in the world, I don't know what is. Dark, thick and jammy, with dense layers of fruit, spice and oak. Scents of sandalwood, coffee, mint, pepper and more, much more. In the mouth it offers a seamless, achingly rich mix of fruits, woods and spices. Big, rich, long and deep, it's nonetheless best enjoyed right now, not cellared.",50.0,94,8,0.9830952708870905,above 40
48087,Iron Horse 1997 T-bar-T Benchmark Red (Sonoma County),"Full and plush, with complex aromas of cassis, cinnamon, earth, cedar, coffee and cream. Low in acidity, it is large in depth of fruit and flavor, with black currants, earth and coffee reigning on the palate and into the finish. A sensuous texture and long finish with soft tannins complete the pleasure package. Very approachable; drink now through 2008.",50.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
17524,Gloria Ferrer 1997 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"This is the winery's most expensive bottling, a late disgorged bubbly that has now seen a decade of age. It shows the elegant polish of the '97 Royal Cuvée, but is superior even to it in richness. The creamy smoothness is the star attraction, but so are the subtle citrus, raspberry, brioche and vanilla flavors. Impeccably dry balance guarantees that this beautiful brut will age effortlessly for 10 years, if not longer.",50.0,95,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
94331,Glen Fiona 1997 Basket Press Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rhône-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.",55.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
66101,Schramsberg 1993 J. Schram  (Napa Valley),"An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.",65.0,93,8,0.9851335269383661,above 40
62666,M. Cosentino 1997 The Poet Red (Napa Valley),"Forward aromas of ripe cherries and deep vanillin oak meld nicely. Black plum, sweet cherry and coffee flavors, with cedar accents. The very full, supple mouthfeel is captivating. Shows fine length, spicy dry tannins and the stuffing to last. Hold four or more years, as it will keep for ages.",65.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
9936,Dolce 1998 White (Napa Valley),"Ripe hay, vanilla, and apricot mark the nose; deep orange flavors with cinnamon spice notes and a very smooth mouthfeel are the already promising attributes of this infant. All the right elements are there, and in good balance. Best cellared for three to five years.",75.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905,above 40
17125,Niebaum-Coppola 1999 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),"A wonderfully refined wine, with firm, ripe tannins that fream an elegant blend of rich plum, balckberry, coffee, chocolate, cassis, black cherry, cedar and spice flavors. The finish is long and smooth, with a bright cherry boost at the end. Francis Coppola's benchmark wine.",100.0,94,8,0.9795773347375224,above 40
48098,Dominus 1997 Estate Bottled Red (Napa Valley),"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound. The finish is especially tight, with dry tannins and complex mineral and earth elements. Huge but refined, the quintessential iron fist in a velvet glove; it needs time.",100.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
89601,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Cask 23 Red (Napa Valley),"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.",150.0,95,8,0.9830952708870905,above 40
6033,Iron Horse 1996 Joy! Rosé Sparkling (Green Valley),"This Brut-style wine feels extraordinarily refined in the mouth, with a silky, airy texture. The flavors of toffee, butterscotch, orange marmalade and vanilla bean are rich, but balanced with yeasty bitterness and bright acidity. Gorgeous to drink now, anywhere, anytime, with practically anything. Pricey, yes, but worth it for special occasions.",160.0,94,8,0.9861271836406683,above 40
74745,Iron Horse 1997 Joy! Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),"A triumph, really. Held back for 14 years and just recently disgorged, it's fantastically rich and complex, just oozing the most delicious orange, butterscotch, yeast and toast flavors. So silky, so sweet in fruit, and yet with a dry finish. Stands out in any tasting of the best sparklers. Hard to imagine a California bubbly better than this.",179.0,97,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
52223,Schramsberg 1997 J. Schram Late Disgorged 150th Anniversary Release Sparkling (Napa-Monterey-Mendocino),"This spectacular brut-style sparkler that's made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir still has plenty of tart acidity and yeastiness, providing the backdrop for rich, concentrated flavors of lime, raspberry, orange, brioche, mineral, vanilla and spice. It's enjoyable now, a tête de cuvée that is among the best California bubblies of the year, and it will continue to develop bottle complexity for many years.",200.0,96,8,0.9851487050465235,above 40
