89,Soquel Vineyards 2013 Intreccio Library Selection Red (Napa Valley),"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate.

154,Dracaena 2013 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose.

371,Guardian 2013 Confidential Source Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree.

458,Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley),"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",35.0,91,2,0.9985205942544925
459,Qupé 2013 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard.

496,Limerick Lane 2013 Hail Mary Syrah-Grenache (Russian River Valley),"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper.

673,Pech Merle 2013 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine.

The palate is rich and densely concentrated, kept taut by a frame of bold tannins. It's pleasant now but should develop smoky, savory complexities through 2023.",22.0,89,2,0.9985205942544925
14234,Hearst Ranch 2013 Chileno Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"Leather, smoked beef, beef jerky and black currant aromas show on the nose of this smoky bottling, whose name is a nod to one of the historic Hearst Ranch's old cowboy camps.

It's dry, crisp in acidity and savory in lime, orange, kumquat and vanilla flavors that finish long and clean.

15209,Fulcrum 2013 Landy Vineyard Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),"This is a relatively light-bodied and elegant version of the variety, softly approachable and enjoyable even in its youth.

Mushroom aromas give it a Pinot Noir-esque personality at first, before layers of red and black berry provide sultry, juicy texture and flavor. The finish is chewy, asking for more time. Cellar through 2023.",48.0,92,2,0.9985205942544925
15285,Site 2013 Larner Vineyard Viognier (Ballard Canyon),"From an area better known for red wines, this bottling by Paso Robles-based Jeremy Weintraub shows the strong white wine potential of this new Santa Barbara County appellation.

15351,Longboard 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Dry and refreshing, it's steely in stone fruit and pineapple.

15507,Shafer 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a robust, dense and tannic wine, with 8% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It needs time to unravel what are now just mere suggestions of coffee and black-cherry jam, with seasonings of cedar, peppercorn and dried sage.

15565,Sequin 2013 Delicately Bubbled Pinot Grigio (California),"Sweetness, softness and a little carbonation make this drink more like a Moscato.

15633,Anthony Nappa 2013 Giallo Sémillon (North Fork of Long Island),"Bold and unconventional, there's nothing quite like this late-harvest wine. Made from Sémillon grapes left to ripen and shrivel through midwinter, it's deeply concentrated with dried mango and orange-peel flavors. Fermentation via natural yeast on its skins lends a deeply phenolic astringency to the palate. It's dusty and mineral with a sherried aldehydic character attributable to deliberate oxidation in barrels, yet somehow, it maintains a luminous core of fresh fruit. A curious and thought-provoking wine for the adventurous wine lover.",40.0,89,2,0.9985205942544925
15644,Wölffer 2013 Coeur Cheval Petit Verdot (Long Island),"Bold swathes of bramble, toast and smoke reverberate throughout this inky rich red. While lusciously concentrated, it's not at all brawny with tart red-currant acidity and fine-grained tannins lending a four-square frame of structure.

15646,Brian Benson 2013 Arbor Creek Vineyard Primitivo (Paso Robles),"Bright olallieberrries, fresh lilacs and crushed graphite show on the rather boisterous nose of this bottling.

15692,Rocky Hill 2013 Richard Dinner Vineyard Buddy's Blend White (Sonoma Mountain),"A curious mix of 77% Pinot Gris and 33% Chardonnay from a sought-after vineyard site, Buddy's is oaky, salty and thick, with a floral bouquet that lightens its load and represents the Pinot Gris component well. It may need more time to harmonize.",24.0,86,2,0.9985205942544925
15721,Woodbury 2013 Semi Dry Riesling (New York),"Bracing aromas of lemon and grapefruit meld into spice, caramel and red apple on the palate of this zesty off-dry Riesling. It's spry and lean yet juicy and gulpable. Drink now through 2019.",18.0,87,2,0.9985205942544925

15813,Oak Knoll 2013 Sheppard Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This starts to fall flat even as it hits the mouth. It's got some puckery citrus and apple fruit, then rolls into a thin finish. The aftertaste shows some slightly bitter skin flavors.",14.0,85,2,0.9985205942544925
15814,Hey Mambo 2013 White (California),"Strong grassy aromas and flavors come with an almost sweet feel in the mouth in this medium-bodied, rather soft-texured white wine.

15888,K Vintners 2013 Charlotte Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Mourvèdre (45%), Grenache (31%) and Syrah (12%) make up the majority of this wine, which is fleshed out with Counoise, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul.

15894,Maragas 2013 Tempranillo (Applegate Valley),"This rustic wine is pure varietal and spent a year in 20% new French oak. Scents favor asphalt and tar rather than oak and toast, and the candied red fruits do not speak the usual varietal flavors. But this is perfectly fine for every day drinking.",28.0,85,2,0.9985205942544925
15897,Season 2013 Limited Edition Series Carmenère (Southern Oregon),"If the staunchly herbal and green-bean scents and flavors often found with this grape are your cup of tea, this will prove enjoyable.

36785,Frey 2013 Estate Grown Biodynamic Syrah (Redwood Valley),"This full-bodied and tannic wine balances richness and restraint well. The color is basically black with a smoky red rim, while the aroma is full of inviting ripe fruit, like boysenberries and blackberries with a whiff of wet earth and dried herbs.

36945,Remy 2013 Lone Madrone Vineyard Lagrein (Willamette Valley),"Oregon Lagrein has to be about as rare as it gets. It's almost jet black, yet just 10% alcohol.

36954,Bell 2013 Merlot (Yountville),"Closed aromas make it a challenge at first to get a read on this wine that takes time to unfurl touches of herb and dried fruit.

36968,Côte Bonneville 2013 DuBrul Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity.

37231,Zaca Mesa 2013 Z Gris Estate Grown and Bottled Dry Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible.

40497,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Malbec (Livermore Valley),"This wine is serious in style, from the deep, dark color to the tempting touch of oak in the aroma to the plump but tangy fruit flavors. Its full body and nicely tannic texture gives it some grip on the palate.",32.0,88,2,0.9985205942544925
40501,Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling.

The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.",49.0,88,2,0.9985205942544925
40504,Monte Volpe 2013 Montepulciano (Mendocino County),"It's a treat to taste this varietal that is so popular in Italy, but rarely bottled by California wineries. This is a big-impact wine that is not overly full bodied. It is dark colored, full of dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and black fig, and moderately tannic but also fresh and lively.",28.0,88,2,0.9985205942544925
40506,"Naggiar 2013 Estate Grown, Produced and Bottled Syrah (Sierra Foothills)","Aromas and flavors like raisins and dried figs, together with full body and a fairly thick texture make this wine mouth filling and rich.

40507,Peter Franus 2013 Brandlin Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),"Brambly berry and heaps of brown sugar combine for a thick, soft and richly layered wine that pushes the limits in terms of ripeness.

40513,Iron Hub 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"Very mellow and mature tasting, this full-bodied wine leaves no rough edges or elbows sticking out, so sipping it is a pleasure.

40571,Domaine Serene 2013 Grand Cheval Pinot Noir-Syrah (Oregon),"This unique blend of Dundee Hill Pinot Noir and Walla Walla Syrah seduces instantly with a bouquet redolent of smoke and licorice, tobacco and vanilla.

40609,2Plank 2013 Solstice Viognier (El Dorado),"A deep gold-orange color and floral aromas lead to rich, broad peach and apricot flavors that are moderately sweet and nicely concentrated.

40625,Swedish Hill 2013 Doyle Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"While lemony-fresh with a streak of crushed-stone minerality, this medium-bodied white lacks the exuberance and spice expected of Gewürztraminer.

40702,Hermann J. Wiemer 2013 Josef Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),"The 2013 Josef Vineyard is quieter on the nose than the more exuberant Magdalena, but the palate packs plenty of luscious fruit and floral punch.

Delicious now but will improve through 2023.",39.0,94,2,0.9985205942544925
40712,Skyline Wines 2013 Artisan White (Central Coast),"This curious blend of 61% Riesling and 39% Sauvignon Blanc manages to succeed, with lime rinds, limestone and wafts of gasoline intriguing the nose.

41007,Coffee Pot Cellars 2013 Meritage (North Fork of Long Island),"Bold hits of spice and toasted cedar envelop ripe black-cherry and plum flavors in this Merlot-based wine (augmented by proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot).

41074,Portfolio 2013 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley),"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.",155.0,96,2,0.9985205942544925
41084,Vina Robles 2013 Suendero Red (Paso Robles),"This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg.

41105,Crux 2013 Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),"Just a small amount of this wine was made, blended with 7% Zinfandel and 5% Syrah.

41158,Spindrift Cellars 2013 Pinot Gris & Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"This interesting rosé mixes 78% Pinot Noir with 22% Pinot Gris.

A strong boysenberry pie aroma is lifted by purple flower scents on the nose, and the palate's lush black cherry, vanilla and mocha spice flavors are reminiscent of a dessert wine without being sweet.",25.0,93,2,0.9985205942544925
41261,Gainey 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"The nose on this wine from the longtime Santa Ynez Valley producer is a bit faint, with wet lawn and lemon most apparent.

41873,Kathryn Kennedy 2013 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"With a tiny bit of breathing room, this wine opens up magically into dark earth, crushed asphalt, blackberry jam, cappuccino and mocha on the nose, which predict a tarry texture. Indeed, the structure is firm and fine-tuned, yet vibrant with boisterous acidity, showing layered flavors of dark fruit enhance by cedar, sandalwood and incense notes. Drink 2017–2033.",42.0,94,2,0.9985205942544925
41886,Calcareous 2013 Moose Syrah-Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),"This wine begins a bit wound-up and restrained on the nose, but then reveals waves of cassis, blackcurrant, elderberry and caramelized beef tips. The flavors are woven together perfectly, showing deep blueberry syrup, dark-chocolate chips, brighter plums, lovely lilacs and a touch of tar. It's deep, dark and complex.",49.0,94,2,0.9985205942544925
41914,B. Leighton 2013 Olsen Brothers Vineyard Petit Verdot (Yakima Valley),"This is an exceptional example of this variety, with aromas of fresh herb, violets, orange peel and black fruit.

42190,Januik 2013 Sagemoor Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is more a Bordeaux Blanc with Sémillon (15%) playing a prominent role.

42192,La Folia Winery 2013 Fiano (Sierra Foothills),"This is an interesting, dry white wine from an unusual grape variety.

42200,Sanguis 2013 Rosé (Central Coast),"Rather dark in mauve colors and slightly cloudy, this wine by urban vintner Matthias Pippig offers rather heady aromas for a rosé, with smashed olallieberry, blackberry and a touch of cardamom spice.

42223,Roku 2013 Riesling (Monterey County),"Sweet on the nose with honeysuckle, golden honey, apple syrup and a touch of cement minerality, this wine is aimed at pairing with Asian food.

42231,Jewelry Box 2013 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),"Just-squeezed lime aromas mesh with riper green and yellow apples and wet stone on the nose of this simple yet quaffable boxed wine. The flavors lack energy, but show familiar apple and lime characteristics.",28.0,84,2,0.9985205942544925
42293,Grizzly Peak 2013 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),"A disappointment after the outstanding 2012, this is a tannic thin wine, with strong accents of mushroom. Much like a simple cru Bordeaux, it's probably best served with grilled meat or burgers.",25.0,85,2,0.9985205942544925
42395,HammerSky 2013 Straight de Barrel Merlot (Paso Robles),"This squat bottle comes, indeed, straight from the barrel with no filtering, and works quite well.

42407,Callaway 2013 Winemaker's Reserve Roussanne (Temecula Valley),"Honey, jasmine, salted nectarine, yellow melon and plumeria flowers pop on the nose of this bottling that indicates Roussanne may do well in Temecula. There's solid yellow-grapefruit-pith grip to the palate, a touch of tart tangerine, slate minerality and some botanical elements.

42634,Terre Rouge 2013 Enigma White (Sierra Foothills),"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors. It's a wine for lingering over, because it reveals its best stuff after time in the glass.

43278,Crux 2013 Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),"Just a small amount of this wine was made, blended with 7% Zinfandel and 5% Syrah.

43344,Saviah 2013 Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This variety is still a rarity in the valley, though it is up-and-coming.

43361,Chimney Rock 2013 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),"This is an austere, elegant study in power and grace, blending 53% Merlot with 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial and tannin-defined as many of its brethren of this vintage, it shows cedar, pencil shavings and a touch of tobacco, more savory than fruit-driven.

43605,Verterra 2013 Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),"There's a blanket of dusty-pollen over notions of underripe peach and green apple on the nose.

47004,Sofia 2013 Red (Paso Robles),"This oddly shaped bottle of lightly colored wine shows aromas of boysenberry, dried rose petals, cranberry soda and minty root beer.

47007,Taft Street 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Light in color and seemingly simple, this wine celebrates the virtues of fresh-squeezed citrus and peach while floating through floating clouds of air, that's how light it remains on the palate.

47036,Pezzi King 2013 Oakey Grande Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Fistfuls of oak, heat and chocolate-covered blackberry form the basis for this hugely ripe, leathery wine that features a sideshow of tannin.

47060,Ca' Momi 2013 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"American oak stands out on the nose, before this wine offers bright red raspberry, blackberry and an unexpected crispness.

47158,Lost Blues 2013 Good Fences Syrah-Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),"Emerging winemaker Giovanni Grandinetti is one to watch. In this bottling he blends co-fermented lots of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache from Bien Nacido and Murmur vineyards to produce aromas reminiscent of venison in a rainbow peppercorn glaze, with touches of tar and crushed graphite. The palate is likewise quite gamy and tarry, with dried beef and teriyaki touches.",42.0,92,2,0.9985205942544925
47160,Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island),"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate.

47324,Shannon 2013 Reserve Two Bud Block Zinfandel (Lake County),"Winemaker Joy Merrilees got more oomph out of Two Bud Block in 2013.

47404,Hermann J. Wiemer 2013 Cuvée Brut  (Seneca Lake),"Wiemer's Cuvée Brut is fresher and more forward than the producer's longer-aged blanc de blanc. Yet amidst the cutting green apple and lemon, there's plenty of autolytic character, expressed as whispers of toast, rising dough and burnt sugar. It's vibrantly balanced by tiny, penetrating bubbles and a lingering, fresh finish.",32.0,92,2,0.9985205942544925
47512,San Simeon 2013 Sran Vineyard Estate Viognier (Paso Robles),"White flowers and a red apple candy reveal themselves on the nose, but the strongest aromas convey a concentrated pear-peach perfume.
