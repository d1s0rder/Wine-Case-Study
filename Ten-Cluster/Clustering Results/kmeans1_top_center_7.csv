417,Bell 2009 Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley.

427,Lyeth 2010 L de Lyeth Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet.

There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part.

1249,Substance 2006 Cs Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen.

1321,Grimm's Bluff 2014 Cliff Hanger Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong.",72.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
1328,Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",175.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
1330,Sixteen by Twenty 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",60.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178

1338,Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",20.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
1374,Charles Krug 2009 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.",75.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
1384,Steven Kent 2009 The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A new addition to Steven Kent's lineup of exemplary Cabernets, this is 100% Cabernet from Ghielmetti Vineyard, one of Kent's favorite pieces of Livermore ground.

1422,JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",150.0,97,7,0.9989985700457178

1534,Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",115.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
1540,Ugly Duckling 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon.

1659,Viluko 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.",50.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
1666,Long Meadow Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",47.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
1667,Mario Bazán 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",60.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
1668,Medlock Ames 2011 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

1683,Hendry 2011 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties.

1688,Hundred Acre 2008 Few and Far Between Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry.

Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",48.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
1726,Hendry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.",55.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178

1757,Cade 2009 Napa Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors.

1872,Waypoint 2006 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar.

1873,Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth.

2141,Foyt Family 2009 No. 77 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.",75.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

2718,Joseph Carr 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Deep and lush aromas of candied blueberry and black cherry meet with chocolate cake, light brown spices and a touch of beef jerky on the nose of this judiciously priced wine. Though a tad light on the palate at first, it has an energetic and spicy acidity that carries forth flavors of tobacco and black fruit.",40.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
2727,Pepper Bridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate.

2745,Forgeron 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins.

2777,Flora Springs 2008 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust.

2901,Bell 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass.

2916,Stryker Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",35.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

2934,Hill Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short.",55.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
2988,St. Clement 2004 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",80.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
2989,Arbios 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked.

3033,Sojourn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak.

3201,L'Ecole No. 41 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"L'Ecole's Columbia Valley Cabernet is again 100% varietal; the blending magic comes from a mix of excellent vineyards. This is a classy, classic wine, with pinpoint structure and spot-on varietal character. The compact palate is packed with details, and though it's drinking well, it is clearly a wine to cellar for a while longer. Notes of clean earth, clover, herb and light chocolate add depth to a core of black cherry and cassis.",32.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
3214,L'Ecole No. 41 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"L'Ecole's Walla Walla Cabernet has a soft-focus silkiness, an almost gauzy character. Behind that film is a wine tasting of wild berries, Bing cherries and fresh herbs, with light streaks of coffee and moist earth. Give this one plenty of decanting and the scrim lifts away and reveals a firm, beautifully balanced and nuanced wine.",40.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
3231,Falkner 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley),"There is a great deal of restraint exercised in this bottling from this warmer SoCal region, with tightly wound blackberry, black currant and turned loam on the nose. The flavors are also still wrapped up firmly, with more black currant, asphalt and gravel hidden behind sticky tannins. This wine is still young and should age well.",60.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178

3294,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb.

3298,Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",40.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
3305,Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

3306,Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",50.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
3362,Pondera 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A high-toned whiff of Band-Aid opens into a broadly flavored wine, with notes of black fruits, baking spices and dark threads of charcoal and roasted coffee. Best for drinking over the next 2–3 years.",30.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

3421,Sheldon 2012 D'Alliard Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Now for something completely different.

3441,Avalon 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Very fruity, fresh and easy to enjoy, this has the smoothness of barrel age but little overt oak flavor.

3486,Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",55.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
3493,Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers.

3509,Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",10.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
3575,M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",195.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
3580,Corison 2006 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",98.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178

Cohn 2010 Olive Hill Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Mint and tarragon come to the fore aromatically in this vineyard-designate, a soft, approachable mix of juicy plum, red berry and chocolate.

3721,En Garde 2013 Greenville Summit Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner.

3744,Michel-Schlumberger 2013 Platinum Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"This full-bodied, quite ripe red has a classical edge in its grip of pencil led, black currant and dense blackberry fruit. Despite its heft and youthful tannins, it shows promise of aging in its backbone of structure and subtle grace. Enjoy best 2023 through 2028.",75.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
3764,Sequoia Grove 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The winery's larger-production blend of several vineyard sources, given 20 months in American oak, this wine opens in pungent earth, soy and mushroom, reminiscent of a beef bouillon or beef stew.

3885,Martin Ranch 2005 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Lots of juicy blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young wine.

4022,Pine Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Ripe to the point of being overripe, this has a sweet raisin and prune note to the blackberry flavor. It's clear that the winemaker was trying to make a flashy, opulent Cab, but this one carries it over the top. Not likely to benefit from age, so drink up.",90.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178

Blended with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, it sings in robust red and black cherry and currant, as well as more luxurious waves of chocolate and vanilla. There's a forwardness to the texture, making for a wine that's both big and happy.",67.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4098,Harlow Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish.",11.0,81,7,0.9989985700457178
4139,St. Francis 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Good price for a nicely complex Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and smooth in tannins, it shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and herb flavors, with a kiss of oak.",22.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4141,Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",40.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4146,Beringer 2007 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",115.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4195,Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",75.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4202,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"This wine has bold aromas of wood smoke and vanilla, a very firm, fine-grained and tannic texture, and lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors. It's a big, robust wine—pour alongside hefty proteins and settle back for the evening.",70.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4211,Michael David 2013 Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020.",20.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4213,Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",40.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4253,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"An earthy, leathery, spicy nose dominates this 100% Cabernet from 17-year-old vines. This is an elegant, complex, earthy wine, beautifully balanced with classic cassis laced with leather, barnyard, coffee, smoke and spice. 180 cases made.",32.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4265,Seven Hills 1997 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",25.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4276,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging.",25.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
4284,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 418 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Blackberry, black currant, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It shows real Oakville character, at a good price. Gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015.",25.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4323,Concannon 2009 Conservancy Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish.",18.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
4336,La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",26.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
4404,William Hill Estate 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),"This bright and engaging wine looks quite deep in color, smells jammy, tastes fresh, young and gushing with ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. It's not too tannic, not too full-bodied, appropriately dry and easy to enjoy.",17.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4439,Morro Bay 2008 Split Oak Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A fine, soft-tannined Cab made from Lodi Rules grapes missing some body in the midpalate, but otherwise fair for the $12 price.",12.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
4449,Tortoise Creek 2008 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough—and very fairly priced—to pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.",11.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
4467,ZD 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A finely crafted, complex Cabernet that shows classic Napa construction. The tannins are very fine and the acidity balancing, while the flavors are rich in black currants, minerals and cedar. Drink now–2017.",60.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4468,Joseph Phelps 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine shows the glamour you expect from a Phelps Cabernet. It's softly tannic and rich in blackberries, currants, licorice and cedar, with a lovely structure. Nice to drink now, right out of the bottle. Easy to find, with 17,300 cases produced.",65.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4506,Prime 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.",59.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
4510,Signorello 2009 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",145.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4511,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",210.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4512,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 FAY Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet, easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink now–2015.",95.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4515,Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Vintage VI Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",100.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4516,Corliss Estates 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release. Smooth as silk, it mixes berry, cherry and plum notes, with whiffs of smoke, green tea, and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.",75.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4517,Creō 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role, but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.",75.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4518,Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018, and it could go far beyond that.",150.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4521,Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",230.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4522,K Vintners 2009 Stoneridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"This is pure Cabernet—tight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake.",45.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4523,Krupp Brothers 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region, and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe, complex flavors. It's high in alcohol, which gives it some heat, and it is rich in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and cassis liqueur. Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink now.",75.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4524,Constant 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lush, plush and absolutely delicious, this shows a range of softly approachable flavors, including blackberry, cherry, currant, anise, cocoa, mineral, buttery oak and spice. The tannins are thick but finely ground. It's firmly set in the modern cult style and may not be an ager, but it sure impresses now.",130.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4525,Hewitt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.",85.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
4536,Gibbs 2010 Obsidian Block Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Attractively priced, this Cab—with 5% Petit Verdot—offers meaty bacon and smoky oak character around sizable tannins, black currant, black licorice and a finishing dust of mocha.",36.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4537,Greyscale 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.",54.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4539,Piña 2011 Firehouse Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.",85.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4541,Renteria 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a modestly priced Napa Cabernet that's feral and brambly, the flavors well-composed and soft in black plum and black cherry. It's well balanced and structured, with ample tannins and length on the finish.",32.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4553,Arbor Crest 2012 Five Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.",20.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
4554,Genius Wines 2009 Creò Clajeux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),"Sanguine and brawny, it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit, with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip.",75.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4587,Waterbrook 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, this Cabernet—which includes healthy doses of Malbec and Syrah—is light in style with notes of herbs and currant. With the oak (21% new American) dialed back, it's fresh and direct.",14.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
4603,Brilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.",85.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
4605,Les Belles Collines 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Softened by 10% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this is a medium-bodied, elegant wine, with highlights of coffee, cedar and cherry-vanilla. Classic elements of cedar and dried herb complement firm, solid tannin.",70.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
4626,Gundlach Bundschu 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.",50.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
4652,Valley of the Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A good, dry Cabernet whose fruit flavors are balanced with rich tannins. Offers upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cocoa. Good price, considering the elegance",20.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4657,Brandlin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Even for a Mount Veeder Cab, this one's pretty tannic. It also seems very oaky, with lots of caramelized, charred wood. Somewhere underneath it all are blackberries and black currants that are sweetly ripe. Your best bet is to cellar it, but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.",85.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4666,Rutherford Hill 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",51.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4667,Stewart 2011 Hollis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, soft, ripe and juicy, this Cab shows all the hallmarks of the modern cult style. It's incredibly lavish in oak, blackberry pie, cassis liqueur and licorice flavors, and should drink well for the next six years.",40.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4687,Stewart 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little ungainly now, with stiff tannins and lots of fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit colliding with unintegrated oak notes. All the parts are there, but they need until 2019–2020 to meld.",65.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
4698,Hall 2011 Bergfeld Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Bergfeld is named for the winery's historic owner and the land he originally planted around the winery in 1873.

4699,Hunt McKay 2011 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry. With medium weight that picks up steam on the milk-chocolate finish, it's an impressive sipper or worthy companion to steak and potatoes.",125.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
4710,Merryvale 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Despite the challenging harvest, this Cabernet excels in juicy blueberry and plum tones. Dusted with cinnamon on the finish, it shows a level-headed use of oak, imparting a soft, expressive texture marked by acidity. Enjoy now or cellar through 2026.",65.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
4736,Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A 100% varietal wine from the winery property, certified organic to boot, this is classic in cedar, currant and a freshness of blackberry.

4813,Atalon 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A bit rugged, with some unripeness, but otherwise a solid Cabernet, drily tannic and clean. The blackberry jam and oak flavors are pleasant.",40.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
4849,Hooker 2011 Old Boys Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Blackberry and cherry jam and caramelized oak flavors characterize this simple Cabernet. The tannins add good, dry structure, but the wine still feels simple and candied.",48.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
4852,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2010 Alexander School Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"There's a brown sugar, candied edge to the raspberries and cherries of this 100% Cabernet. Plenty of caramelized oak, too. The result is a soft wine that grows cloying after a while.",45.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
4886,Tortoise Creek 2013 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This nicely rich and rounded wine smells like vanilla and toasted bread. The flavors are ripe and black-cherry-like, with a hint of chocolate and baking spices that comes from oak. It's medium bodied and easy to like.",12.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
4915,Justin 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Dry and tannic, this fresh young Cabernet shows good varietal flavors of blackberries and currants, touched by smoky oak. There are some green notes. It's a sound wine, but unlikely to develop, so drink up.",26.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
4943,Sequum 2009 Kidd Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.",62.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
4944,Sequum 2010 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",55.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
4951,Duckhorn 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year.",80.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5027,Martin Ranch 2004 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish.",50.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
5065,Obsidian Ridge 2005 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002, and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet.

Provides more evidence that this Red Hills of Lake County appellation has enormous potential for Cabernet.",27.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
5135,Kirkland Signature 2011 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a good price for a Cabernet this rich and satisfying. It's dry, tannic and opulent in blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a complex note of green olives. It's fully ready to drink now.",20.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
5146,Hearst Ranch 2013 Bunkhouse Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Ripe blueberries, toasted oak, caramel, brown coffee, black pepper and crushed grape seeds combine for a pleasant smoke and fruit combo on the nose of this bottling.

5151,Collier Falls 2012 Hillside Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine surprises in its sanguine nature, dusted in currant and cranberry, with a dustiness to the firm, but not overbearing tannins.

5249,Reyes 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Pelona Valley),"There are some curious, almost Syrah-like elements to this bottling from a rural region between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, but it's an interesting wine. Aromas of concentrated blueberry and blackberry meet with tar, peppercorn and black licorice on the nose. Then the palate shows dark fruit with fennel, oregano, marjoram, black-olive and beef-crust flavors.",26.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5250,Rodney Strong 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From a selection of sites within the appellation, this approachable wine is dusty and grippy, with strong flavors of chocolate, plum and blackberry.

5256,Windy Canyon 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of assorted green herbs mix with notes of black cherry, anise and barrel spice. The blackberry flavors are sweet and tacky in feel. There's intrigue but it doesn't all come together.",28.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5259,Beringer 2015 Founders' Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Sturdy and flavorful, this is a well-made, dry and moderately tannic wine that smells beefy, salt-and-peppery, and tastes juicy like raspberries and cherries with a little bit of meatiness coming through for complexity. The texture has good grip and acidity so the wine will pair well with big proteins.",10.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5283,Kenwood 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Densely extracted, this larger production wine succeeds in keeping things simple and approachable, its midpalate juicy and round, with accents of graphite, compost, leather, black currant and berry.",19.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5292,Dumas Station 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas of dried cranberry, raspberry, vanilla, dill and spice are followed by velvety fruit and barrel flavors that show a lovely sense of balance. It provides plenty of interest but the barrel notes seem a bit too predominant.",38.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5326,Hogue 2013 Genesis Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, dried herbs and plum lead to black-currant flavors that display a reserved styling. A light grip of tannins provides the frame.",16.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5331,Madrigal 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"A ripe, easygoing wine, made in small amounts, this dances in smoky blackberry jam and clove. The tannins are approachable and integrated, and the oak happy to play a supporting role.",80.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5335,Rodney Strong 2012 Rockaway Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From the producer's sloping vineyard at a 750-foot elevation in the eastern section of the appellation, this wine also contains 4% Malbec from the same site. Earthy in stewed mushrooms, grilled meat and bouillon, it's a bold, dense powerhouse of a wine, with a tobacco-laden finish.",75.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5336,Ross Andrew 2013 Glaze Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blackberry and black-currant aromas are fresh and bright, with herbal notes providing accents.

5352,Terra Valentine 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"There's a vegetable aroma in this wine, not exactly herbs, more like asparagus. In the mouth, the Cab tastes soft, sweet and candied. Average at best, and not an ager.",40.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
5361,Little Stone Vineyard 2007 Adrian's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft, thin and simple. Other than that, it's not bad, with proper blackberry and spice flavors and smooth tannins. Give it greater concentration, and the score would rise.",19.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
5367,Oberon 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft, simple and a little vegetal, with modest blackberry and oak flavors. The tannins are well-sculpted.",22.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
5376,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"The flavors of this medium-bodied wine are hearty, with bell pepper, black pepper and green olive notes, and in this vein it's tasty and fairly concentrated. The balance is good, the palate sensation is nicely dry and the finish lingers a bit.",10.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
5404,Newton 2014 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Dried herb, graphite and cedar form a cast of characters around a big powerful tannin concentration in this appellation wine.

5409,Russian Ridge 2013 Martin Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Black cherry and black currant open the nose on this bottling, but there are more savory components of soy and black pepper lurking in the background. The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate.",34.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
5419,Arrowood 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),"Made from two vineyards in the appellation, this shows black cherry, cedar and tobacco, with a graphite element not far behind. Sticky tannins provide grip and weight, as full-bodied richly ripe blue fruit and plum form a continuum between hits of clove.",35.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
5453,Abeja 2011 Heather Hill Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this offers aromas of coffee, cherry, chocolate, oak spices and green herbs that show a touch of underripeness.

5462,Slingshot 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is still a baby, pudgy and withdrawn, yet still it imparts enough herbal and black cherry to be inviting and promising. It retains the girth of tannins expected in a youthful wine, but is already integrative in oak. Let it open for the full effect.",23.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
5468,Clayhouse 2013 Red Cedar Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"An extremely good deal, this wine will keep both neophytes and experts entertained, with aromas of black-plum jam, dark strawberries and graphite on the lively nose.

5480,Terra Valentine 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with 15% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, this wine traffics in huge upfront tannins, accented by clove and dried herb. The power relents on the finish, ending soft.",48.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
5484,V. Sattui 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A twinge of cedar and bell pepper show on the nose, before a taste of dusty tannin, clove spice and red currant layer themselves softly and simply around a medium-sized body. Let the wine open before enjoying.",39.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
5508,18401 Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This wine is all varietal coming from the esteemed Seven Hills Vineyard.

5519,William Hill Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose. High-toned, structured and elegant, it has subtle power and concentration but remains fresh in the glass. Drink now through 2020.",45.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
5529,Raymond 2012 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Powerful and full-bodied, it's fruity, balanced and enjoyable now.",85.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
5591,Compilation 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Soft and muddled, this is a smoky, dusty Cab with undistinguished red fruit that's quite tannic, especially on the finish. Let it open before drinking.",30.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
5625,Renteria 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Toasty oak and black pepper hit first on the palate and nose, followed by savory, dry tannin, black cherry and vanilla. Restrained and in balance, the Cabernet is supported by 12% Petit Verdot, which adds girth and intensity without becoming extreme.",60.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
5628,Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",89.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
5632,Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",80.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
5633,Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",80.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
5638,Silverado 2009 Limited Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",150.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5641,Leonetti Cellar 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit, mixing Seven Hills, Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes. The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend. Young and chewy, with a hint of herbaceousness, this shows lovely balance and a mix of raspberry, black cherry, cassis, coffee and cacao. It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.",90.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5644,Sequum 2009 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Produced from four vineyards throughout the valley, this Cabernet shows the art of the blend. It's softly tannic and frankly delicious, with dazzlingly rich blackberry, cassis liqueur, anise and mineral flavors. Hard to describe how attractive this wine is now.",50.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5651,Captûre 2010 Révélation Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",140.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5653,Chateau Chevalier 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"This Cab doesn't taste especially Spring Mountain-ish. It could come from anywhere, with its jammy red cherry, mocha and oak flavors that veer into raisins. Soft and a bit hot, it provides pleasant drinking now.",30.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
5658,Miracle Valley 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),Baked strawberry and raspberry aromas carry onto the medium-bodied palate. Fine chalky tannins and bright acids lend the toasted herb flavor structural support.,28.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
5665,Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings.",23.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
5700,Raymond 2014 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This 100% varietal wine from the rocky, mountainous appellation offers sizable tannins and robust, smoky leather, black pepper and cola notes. Full-bodied and concentrated with ripe black fruit, it's a long, brawny experience.",95.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
5707,Sojourn 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a 100% varietal wine from a prime appellation, memorably juicy in raspberry, cassis and red currant with a floral, almost tropical flirtation on the nose. Edgy tannins and a depth of concentration smooth out on the lengthy finish, giving this wine a sense of satisfying completion.",69.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5749,Greenwood Ridge 2013 Hundred Point Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino Ridge),"Contrary to its name, this isn't exactly a 100-point wine, but it is ripe and full-flavored. Smooth on the palate and almost soft in texture, it's medium-bodied and very drinkable.",50.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
5759,Coniglio 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Good structure in this Cab, with firm tannins and fine acidity, but it lacks richness, especially at this price. There's a minty green sharpness next to the black currant flavors, making it feel unripe and unbalanced.",60.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
5772,B Cellars 2009 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This Dr. Crane vineyard has really rocked in recent vintages. Enormously rich and deep, with a fabulous compaction of black currant, dark chocolate, baking spice and cedar flavors. There's an interesting grilled meatiness, like the charred fat on a great steak, and lots of new oak, but it's perfectly integrated. The smoky, toasty barrel notes are perfect companions to the fruit's power. Drink this 100% Cab now and over the next 12–15 years.",145.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
5773,B Cellars 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce. So beautiful now, it's hard to resist drinking it, but this lovely wine should improve for a decade, slowly developing in the bottle.",165.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
5783,Stone The Crows 2010 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch.",85.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5788,Punch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Much of the fruit for this wine comes from Napa's Mount Veeder, with additions from neighboring Sonoma County and other unidentified statewide sources. Even so, this shows a Napa-esque flair, bearing softly ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with balance and richness. The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith.",35.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178

It shows just a trace of bitterness on the finish, so drink soon.",36.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
5826,Del Rio 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),"It's not possible to analyze vineyard practices from afar, but this wine is thin, tart and astringent, suggesting such possibilities as over-cropping, picking too early, or simply the wrong clones. In any event, it's a flavorless wine with no varietal character.",28.0,82,7,0.9989985700457178
5840,Jeunesse 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This Cabernet was made to be consumed as a dessert wine. It's soft, simple and very sweet, with white sugar and cherry jam flavors.",13.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178

5899,Woodward Canyon 2006 Old Vines Dedication Series #26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.",84.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
5904,Roberts & Rogers 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Here's one for the cellar. The tannins swamp the mouth, giving a hard, astringent edge. But the wine is beautifully balanced and dry, with a deep core of black currants, blueberries, spicy plums, cedar and minerals. Impressive. Best after 2010.",75.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5923,Serdonis 2004 Ink Grade Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question.",60.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
5927,Janzen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A brisk, sturdy Cabernet, marked by firm tannins, tart acidity and a marked coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's Janzen's basic Napa Cabernet, and shows the winery's ability to produce elegant Cabs. But it's not an ager.",50.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
5929,Kendall-Jackson 2011 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value.

5971,Padilla Erickson 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Just delicious. Feels soft and lush and chocolaty in the mouth, with melted blackberry and cherry flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. The alcohol is high, in the California style, and the wine won't age, but it's fine now with a grilled steak.",35.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
5980,Barons 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011. A rich mix of berry and cassis dives deeply into the palate, with dark chocolate highlights. The tannins are silky and polished, and the wine seems a sure bet to cellar well until the mid-2020's.",45.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5981,Côtes de Ciel 2012 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"This pure varietal wine showcases rich, ripe cherry pie fruit backed up against a mineral-soaked base. Baking spice highlights and a streak of caramel reflect aging in 100% new French oak. Acids and tannins are proportionate and substantial.",50.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5982,Double Canyon 2012 Double Canyon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe.",48.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5987,San Simeon 2010 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Elegant and attractive aromas of dark violet, red rose, cedar and a touch of vanilla serve as a promising entry point to this Cabernet. A bit of char kicks in on the palate alongside dark chocolate, espresso and ripe plum skin, with roasted beet in the background.",25.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
5994,Diamond Creek 2011 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020.",200.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
6007,Mt. Brave 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"From high-elevation vineyards, this is a lean, dusty wine driven by dried herb, blueberry and savory tobacco, with a floral flirtation on the bouquet. Integrated tannins are still sizable and structured, the midpalate touched by a gamy, meaty suggestion akin to charcuterie.",75.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6008,Northstar 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit for this 100% varietal wine comes from Cold Creek, Klipsun and Anna Marie vineyards.

6024,Judd's Hill 2010 Founder's Art Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Exhibiting cooler-climate characteristics, the fruit sourced primarily from the Stag's Leap District, this wine shows dried herb and cedar on the nose, evolving deeper layers of red cherry and cranberry on the midpalate. It takes on weight and structure on the finish.",80.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6025,Lawrelin 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"No, that vintage is not a typo. This winery holds back its wines for an extended time prior to release. It's in full bloom with aromas of coffee, dried cherry, flowers, leather and black tea. The black fruit flavors are still fresh and lively, showing concentration and detail. Drink now.",48.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6039,Atlas Peak 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"What a great wine for the price. It's made from various Napa mountain vineyards, and shows concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, wrapped into superfine Napa tannins that go down with silky smoothness. Not cheap, but the price is a bargain compared to superexpensive Napa Cabs. At nearly 6,000 cases produced, it's a steal.",35.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
6040,Blue Rock 2007 Best Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Shows the softness and herbal quality that mark Alexander Valley Cabernet, in the best sense. The wine feels fine and beautiful in the mouth, with the complexity and elegance to pair with great food. Delightful for its cherry, berry, currant, cola and oak flavors. Great now, and should develop over the next five years.",75.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
6043,Robert Craig 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Textbook Howell Mountain Cabernet, classic in the volume of its tannins and the intensity of its fruit. Massive and delicious in blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and oak flavors that sink down into the palate and stay there. So good now, it's hard not to drink, but should develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",80.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
6092,Franciscan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Good price for a Cabernet this elegant and classy.

6178,Nathaniel Rose 2012 Left Bank Abigail's Vineyard Domaine Barrien Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake Michigan Shore),"This eponymous label of winemaker Nathaniel Rose is one of his many endeavors in the Michigan wine scene. While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background. The medium-bodied palate is supported by grainy tannins, yet there's a good balance of juicy, red fruit and streaks of granite.",250.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
6199,Paul Hobbs 2011 Beckstoffer Las Piedras Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"From a warm vineyard site in a cool year, this Cab intrigues in sage and chewy black cherry, possessed of a powerful, buoyant minerality.

6221,Robert Karl 2005 Gunselman Bench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Fragrant, smoky, oaky and seductive, this toasty wine is immediately appealing, and has been given the all-star treatment. The young vineyard offers promising fruit; its flavors light and clean, tasting of raspberries and pie cherries. Lots of oak gives it a very chocolaty finish.",37.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
6234,Scotto Family Cellars 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),This is a medium-bodied gently balanced wine with very ripe fruit flavors and a smooth soft texture. Scotto ferments it in stainless steel and ages it for 18 months in pre-used French oak barrels.,13.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
6241,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Gentle in texture and generous in flavor, this wine is medium bodied, rather soft in mouthfeel and has ripe strawberry and red-cherry notes that are direct and delicious, leaving a fruity, almost sweet finish.",8.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
6262,Krutz 2010 Stagecoach Vineyard Limited Edition Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A Syrah-esque bit of smoke and cured meat wafts from this wine aromatically, which follows through on the palate. Bright cherry and currant fruit then intermix with a restrained sense of clove spice, the Stagecoach Cab blended with Malbec and Petit Verdot, aged in 60% new French oak.",55.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
6275,Broken Earth 2010 CV Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.",59.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
6293,Brion 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow.",70.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
6296,William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012.",50.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
6297,Barnett 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"A big, bold and beautiful Cabernet. Will appeal to those who like the California style, although Bordeauxphiles will find it too ripe and fruity. Brims with blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and sweet toasted oak, wrapped into firm, mountain tannins. Now–2014.",65.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178

6349,Arns 2004 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Smells raisiny-Porty, and turns dry and austere in the mouth, with modest currant and oak flavors set off by hard tannins. The official alcohol is only 14.9%, but the wine feels hotter than that.",75.0,82,7,0.9989985700457178
6385,Indigené 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County.

6390,Altamura 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability.",75.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
6418,Raymond 2009 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"As delicious and opulent as they come, yet it's somewhat formulaic. It's all about oak, insanely ripe black currant and dark chocolate fruit, ultrasmooth tannins and heat from alcohol.",85.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
6431,Emblem 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich and velvety, it carries an important mouthfeel consisting of firm tannins, good acidity and a firm, minerally grounding. Fruit is the star, filling the mouth with blackberries and black currants, and a smoky coating of oak. With a dry finish, it's drinking very well now, and will soften through 2018.",35.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
6466,Nice 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness. While the tannins are thick and fine, there's something rustic on the finish in the form of extracted, candied sweetness and heat. Flashy as it is, you're best drinking this wine now.",110.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
6470,Roza Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills),"This is a sophisticated Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend, with 9% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. It carries a note of leather and drying tannins, suggesting that you should drink it fairly soon. It should be delicious with a grilled steak.",14.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
6484,Folie à Deux 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is immediately attractive in blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a subtle coating of smoky oak.

6521,Seven Hills 2014 McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Green herb, barrel spice, clove and cherry aromas intermingle and lead to a highly structured palate, with supple fruit flavors. It might be a touch green for some tastes.",45.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178

6574,Langtry 2010 Tephra Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),"From a high-elevation vineyard on the eastern edge of Lake County, this Cabernet offers sensuously juicy, brambly fruit and a dusty backbone. Rich and chewy, it conveys intense cranberry, black cherry and woodsy cedar.",40.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
6610,Pride Mountain 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma),"Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper. Intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cedar are wrapped into complex but gentle tannins, making the wine drinkable now. But it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",68.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
6643,Francis Ford Coppola 2006 Director's Cut Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.",29.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178

6698,Maryhill 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",36.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178

6713,Snake River 2003 Arena Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Idaho),"Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity.",16.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
6721,Norman 2003 Conquest Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.",20.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
6738,D.R. Stephens 2012 Walther River Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This big-boy, 100% varietal Cab is reflective of both its vintage and provenance, a celebration of black pepper, blackberry and tar around an intensely full-bodied, bittersweet palate. Tobacco leaf and leather saddle interweave themselves through the wine's middle and end. Drink now through 2020.",150.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
6750,Merryvale 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Rustic earth gives way to bright, crisp red fruit and a hit of citrus providing freshness and life.

6760,Textbook 2008 Fin de Journée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Freshly acidic and jammy in blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, this is one of the fruitier Napa Cabs available. It's at its best now, so drink up with a nice steak.",25.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
6770,Atmosphere 2008 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",60.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6802,Rancho Sisquoc 2006 Flood Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"Soft and tannic, with a sour candy-sweet taste, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar. Drink now.",24.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
6832,Shooting Star 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food.

6849,Tamber Bey 2009 Deux Chevaux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.",42.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
6853,Windsor Sonoma 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",30.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
6868,Adams Bench 2010 the V Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aged in 100% new French oak, this dark and muscular wine has lush scents of cut tobacco and dense cassis fruit.

6893,Hunter Ashby 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black currant and cherry flavors, accented with a touch of smoky oak, mark this dry, smooth wine. It has the textural hallmarks of the best of Napa Valley Cabernet, but lacks the richness. Drink now.",23.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
6894,Nicholls 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Gentle and candy ripe, this Cab has pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, red plums, licorice and chocolate, accented with toasty, spicy oak, wrapped into sweet, fine tannins. Too soft for the cellar, so drink up.",85.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
6928,Telaya 2014 Boushey Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine offers aromas of berry compote, funk and potpourri.

6938,Donati 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines),"Extremely rocky and dusty aromas of turned earth and tobacco meet with snapped dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a little-known region 30 miles inland from the Monterey Bay. Espresso bean and black plums show on the impressively dark palate that is well structured, finishing on slight hints of roasted pepper and peppercorns.",20.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
6943,Luna 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This mouthfilling wine is generously ripe and rich, with hints of herb and mountain brush dancing around soft, rounded layers of plum and cinnamon. The finish is lush and lingering.",68.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6947,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2013 Animo Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity.

6952,Rasa 2014 For the Love of the Game Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a single vineyard, 100% varietal wine, aged in 70% new French oak. It draws you into the glass, with notes of char, fig, blackberry, spice and coffee. The dark-roasted coffee and dark-fruit flavors show precision and detail, lingering on the finish. The wood is primary at present but should integrate with time.",95.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
6999,Guarachi Family 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Not offering much now beyond a full body, big tannins, lots of oak and extracted blackberry jam and milk chocolate fruit.

7000,Hightower 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate. The Cabernet fruit is mild and lightly peppery, berry and cranberry mostly. There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak.",35.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7009,Magnificent Wine Company 2008 Steak House Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, young and fruity, with tart berry and bitter herb. The light but slightly green tannins add some useful counterpoint to the cherry pop fruit, giving the wine a more substantial palate impression and length in the finish.",13.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7013,Pontin del Roza 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Nice black cherry fruit powers the nose, with just the barest hints of stem and root. Firm fruit is buttressed by tart acids, and the middle opens up sweetly, adding flavors of cocoa and coffee. —P.G.",18.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7031,Gordon Brothers 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There is just a hint of volatile acidity, enough to brighten the nose, which has Bing cherry and chocolate as well. In the mouth, the fruit has some herb and dill to it, an indication of a cooler vintage, and some fairly stiff tannins. —P.G.",22.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7034,Gallo of Sonoma 1997 Frei Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Oversized, with massive berry-cherry flavors that explode in the mouth. In fact, it's too big. The spicy fruity flavors are so powerful they dominate every other feature. That said, it's dry, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Match it with dramatic, boldly flavored dishes. —S.H.",26.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7055,Von Strasser 2012 Agira Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"From a three-acre vineyard, this wine accented in 2% Petit Verdot offers a sense of gravel underneath the dark, syrupy plum and leathery tannin structure. Midway through, it exhibits cherry, raspberry and vanilla, showing a juicy underbelly that should develop further over time. Drink now through 2022.",80.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
7057,Von Strasser 2012 Spaulding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"From the producer's oldest hillside vineyard, planted in 1967, comes this gem of a wine, a taste of cinnamon toast and black currant. Layered acidity forms a backbone against which concentrated flavors of graham cracker and dark chocolate lie, the finish long and deep. It's built to age, enjoy now through 2025.",80.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
7063,Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"One of the appellation's more famous wines, this opens in black licorice and blackberry, alongside a streak of malted chocolate, soft and sinewy, with a tension of acidity that adds age-worthy structure.

7113,Canyon Wind 2012 Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Grand Valley),"Concentrated black and red berries show depth and meet tobacco, vanilla and sweet cake spice on the nose.

The tannins offer grip but are not completely overpowering, with tart red currant lightly lingering on the finish.",65.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
7156,Wood Family Vineyards 2012 Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Very ripe fruit aromas and flavors in this wine resemble dried plums and cherries.

7261,Stack House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a remarkably affordable find, so good in its red-fruited, tangy acidity and spiciness on the palate.

7279,Rocca 2013 Grigsby Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This 100% varietal wine opens in crayon wax, pencil lead and black pepper.

7282,Laurel Glen 2014 Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"Blended with 10% Merlot, this wine sources grapes both from its famous estate, as well as from nearby Pickberry and Murray vineyards.

7283,Leonetti Cellar 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland, Serra Pedace and Leonetti Old Block. Aromatically brooding at present, it shows intricate notes of barrel spice, thyme, coffee, cranberry, black tea and red and black fruit.

7294,Auclair 2014 Heart of the Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Barrel influences takes over aromatically, with notes of wood, toast and dark chocolate in front of golden raisins, with the fruit seeming somewhat dried out.

7381,Knights Bridge 2010 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So ripe and lush with fruit, this could only be from California. It assaults the palate with blackberries, cherries and mocha, but with an interesting, earthy green olive note. Oak adds predictable but rich notes of buttered toast.

7428,Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 The Rocker Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas.

7463,Boomtown 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"A nice companion to the Boomtown Merlot, this shows similar balance and depth, albeit with an accent on tart berry fruit flavors dusted with dried herbs. There are citrusy acids and a hint of moist earth.",16.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
7494,Columbia Crest 2014 Crowdsourced Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Decisions on the viticulture and winemaking for this wine were all crowdsourced by the winery.

7512,Hunnicutt 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Smoky leather and burly tannins combine for a generously powerful wine, soft in black and red fruit and chocolate.

7608,Altvs 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness. Shows the ripeness of Napa Valley Cabernet, but doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now–2014.",70.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

7963,Hall 2013 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.",165.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
7976,Pride Mountain 2008 Vintner Select Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hugely delicious, just a joy to drink.

7991,Chateau St. Jean 2004 Cinq Cepages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins.

7992,Clos du Val 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop. But it's a cellar guarantee, with a wealth of concentrated cassis and cedar flavors that are just waiting for those tannins to drop out. Best after 2010.",70.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
8005,Riboli 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet.

8006,Sbragia 2005 Adolsen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time.

8029,Renteria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich and full bodied, this is delicious to drink now for its array of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and toast flavors. The tannins are just a bit jagged, so give it a few hours in the decanter.",32.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
8036,Axios 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lush, soft and delicious, this has flavors of chocolate, ripe crushed summer blackberries and a hint of dried currants. This richness is augmented by lots of smoky, sweet oak. It could develop in the bottle, but the fruit might fall out before the tannins soften.",125.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
8128,Clos La Chance 2013 Whitestone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"This bottling is fruit-forward on the nose with aromas of black currant and black plum, but the touches of dark chocolate and roasted game provide depth. It tightens up on the sip, where the blackberry-jam elements are enhanced by vanilla and milk chocolate shavings. The tannins are present but soft, and the acidity is decent, making for a very drinkable expression.",50.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
8173,Sequoia Grove 2010 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature.

8185,Jordan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb.

8237,Blackjack 2010 Harmonie Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"A heavily spiced nose of cracked peppercorn and tobacco notes mesh with blackberry extract and blueberries on this top bottling from the winery.

8268,Tamayo Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a rich, densely layered Cab. It's showing complex flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar.

8280,Shafer 2005 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much.",70.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
8281,Shannon Ridge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),"Released at just a little over a year old, this demonstrates the promise of Lake County for Cabernet.

8363,Ridge 2011 Monte Bello Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage.

8432,Pursued by Bear 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and dried herbs are still quite locked up, with the oak out front.

8435,Les Belles Collines 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar. The considerable density of the tannins and overall firm texture suggest this will benefit from further aging; drink 2018–2022.",65.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
8439,Aperture 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Opaque in color and manner, this wine benefits from the 5% addition of Malbec, a speciality of the producer. Juicy blue and black fruit intermix around a touch of milk chocolate, with smooth tannins and well-integrated oak. This is a classically styled wine balanced against a richness of California fruit.",55.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178

8542,Zaca Mesa 2013 Homage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Plump blackberries and ready-to-pop cherries are laced with touches of fresh tobacco, graphite and turned earth on this very well done Cab.

8563,B Cellars 2013 Kenefick Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"From a warm site in a warm year and entirely varietal, there's much to impress in this wine, from its full-bodied, bold structure to its velvety texture. In between cranberry and pomegranate offer a freshness of flavor, bringing out further acidity before cocoa powder, tar and black cherry take over.",97.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
8575,Addendum 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A Napa Valley wine from the Central Coast folks at Fess Parker Winery, this Cab was aged for more than two years in 67% new French oak.

8592,Addendum 2014 Skellenger Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A 100% varietal, site-specific wine from the heart of the appellation, this succeeds in a herbal persistence and lean nose.

8628,Nickel & Nickel 2010 Branding Iron Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"The Branding Iron Vineyard is located in western Oakville, in the company of some of the greatest names in Napa Valley. The wine is 100% varietal, aged in new and one-year-old oak. In the mouth, it's plush and opulent, with massive blackberry and blueberry fruit, but very tannic, in the Nickel & Nickel style.

8649,Krupp Brothers 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour.",85.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
8665,Stemilt Creek 2010 A Day's Work Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Coming from a cool vintage, this shows notes of green herbs, vanilla and black cherry. It's somewhat lean in feel with puckering acids and chalky tannins.",26.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
8711,Domaine Pouillon 2007 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A menthol/eucalyptus note shoots through the aroma of this pleasant Cabernet. It shows quickly maturing flavors of plum and pie cherry, an easy-drinking softness throughout the mid-palate, and just a hint of heat in the finish.",35.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
8726,Provenance Vineyards 2012 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.",47.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
8735,Steven Kent 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Vivid aromas of tart cherry and cranberry are followed by equally vivid, crisp and tangy flavors that echo the cherry and cranberry but add richer plum notes and nuances of cinnamon, nutmeg and cedar. This is so well balanced and bright that it tastes lip-smacking delicious now but will improve with age through at least 2020.",48.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
8771,LangeTwins 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This wine is well balanced and solidly constructed, wrapping its ripe blackberry and dark plum flavors in firm tannins. Light oak spice, vanilla and cinnamon touches are the icing on the cake.",15.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
8776,Joseph Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.",40.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
8791,Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look.",44.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
8792,Forgeron 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished. The fruit mixes ripe berries and moves smoothly into flavors of earth, smoke, tobacco and graphite.",30.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
8798,Mueller Family Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A wine that's had some time to find itself in bottle, this opens in a wildness of mountain tannin and dusty texture, grippy and dry on the palate. Cedar, tobacco and shy black fruit call out for braised red meat, with a structure that should hold up longer in the cellar if necessary.",80.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
8801,Levendi 2012 Sweetwater Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless.",60.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
8831,Sensorium 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A pretty nice young Cab, though the weather was too hot and the wine is deficient in acidity. But the flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and new oak are delicious, and the tannins are smooth and silky.",40.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
8857,HandCraft 2015 Artisan Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Aromas like black pepper, anise and grilled meat lead to nicely tart flavors and a mildly tannic mouthfeel.

8870,Buehler 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine blended from multiple vineyard souces represents tremendous value for its quality.

8882,Pedroncelli 2012 Wisdom Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens.",36.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
8917,Nickel & Nickel 2014 State Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.",115.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
8919,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is perfumed with lovely violets and tight layers of mixed berries, currants and hints of truffle. It's young and muscular, with a pleasing chewy texture to the tannins. There is the sense that time will unfold the flavors and add nuances of herb and earth, capturing the varietal notes that can be   obliterated by over-ripe fruit and too much new oak.",32.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
8975,Martin Ray 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Pretty sharp in tannins and acids, even for a Stags Leap Cab. Although it has plenty of blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, it's a hard wine. The palate finds so much to like, it wants it to be softer, but it's not, so the gamble is on aging. Try after 2013.",45.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
9001,Hourglass 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.",155.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9034,Obelisco Estate 2013 Nefer III Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of mineral, exotic spice, leather and dried cherry lead to elegantly styled fruit, earth and game flavors. There's intrigue here but it doesn't all come together.",125.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
9037,Whitehall Lane 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This medium-bodied red includes 8% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Toasted oak scents lead the nose, followed by generous cherry, cranberry and cassis notes on the palate, supported by soft acidity.",42.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
9038,Keating 2012 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County),"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak.

9039,Kicker Cane 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Soft with cranberry and red currant accents, this fairly priced wine is subtle in tannin and oak, with a core of succulent black cherry and clove flavor.

9075,Fazeli Cellars 2008 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"From Temecula-based producer Fazeli, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon features a lofty nose that's quite herbal, drifting into eucalyptus land—and tasting of cranberry. Velvety tannins.",44.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

9148,Newton 2009 Red Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),"Ripe and sweet in chocolate and blackberries, this is a Cabernet made for drinking now with rich fare, such as short ribs. It's soft in both tannins and acids, which makes it instantly appealing.",28.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
9152,Sweet Valley 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"There is some volatility in the nose, along with strong scents of the new French oak. But the flavors are substantial and bring tart fruit with black olive, toast and coffee highlights. The acidity seems chalky, but it's a noticeable improvement from previous vintages.",35.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
9159,Merryvale 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A solid effort from this fine winery, from a vintage everyone is increasingly admitting was more difficult than it looked. It’s as middle of the road as you can get. It strikes all the right notes in terms of ripe, polished black-currant fruit, anise and smoky oak, yet never quite achieves complexity. Nonetheless there’s enough harmony and juiciness to satisfy.",25.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
9163,Buttonwood Farm 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Don’t look for Napa-esque depth or richness in South Coast Cabs. The frame is leaner, the flavors more austere. This wine seems thin and sharp, but there’s something about it—a sense of terroir, personality, call it what you will—that’s likable, even complex. It’s a bit aggressive right now, but should soften nicely with 2 or 3 years in the cellar.",18.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
9165,Bel Arbor 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.",6.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
9167,M. Trinchero 1997 Family Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"A nicely crafted wine with all the attributes of fine Cabernet: plush black-currant and berry fruit, a dose of vanilla-scented oak, and sage notes. Drinks dry and smooth, with a few tannins to shed. Finishes rough, but pretty good, especially at this giveaway price.",13.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
9177,Laelaps 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This 100% varietal wine comes from The Rocks region of the valley.

9200,Envy 2012 Fortuna Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A 100% varietal, this represents a tiny offering of this single-vineyard wine. Despite its youth it is silky and supple on the palate.

9210,Galante 2009 Red Rose Hill Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"There's lots of vitality to this Cab, which was blended with Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec. It's complex on the palate with a spectrum of flavors ranging from blackberries and cherries to herbs and mushrooms. It's silky in texture and thoroughly dry in style.

9234,Veedercrest 2008 Villa Mille Rose Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Not very Oakville-like, this Cabernet is bone dry and strong in tannins, giving it an astringent mouthfeel. It's light in body for a Cabernet, with lots of acidity. However, it does have pretty flavors of blackberry and sour cherry candy.",50.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
9235,Jordan 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"With its dry earthiness, this is classic Jordan. It shows blackberry and black cherry flavors, with an herb note. The tannins are gentle. It will age for years, softening and gaining earthy complexities.",52.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
9248,Riverhaven 2007 Riverrock Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed. Hints of earth, clay and chocolate make a lively introduction to a wine loaded with cherry and currant fruit flavors. The wine spent 20 months in French oak, but the barrel scents and flavors are handled lightly; the fruit is the star of this show. A fine debut.",34.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9286,Almquist 2009 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Ripe aromas of cherry, spice and licorice pop, with the warmth of the vintage—along with just-in-check volatiles—showing.

9317,Falcone 2009 Mia's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is just delicious, showing all the fine attributes you'd want from a California Cabernet, except ageability. But who cares, when it's this rich in blackberry and cherry jam, cassis and chocolate, and so balanced? Winemaker John Falcone has brought his years of thoughtful winemaking to this Cab, and of course the favorable 2009 vintage helped.",50.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9333,Rombauer 2012 Diamond Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Burly in black fruit, leather and cigar, this is a smoky, full-bodied and powerful wine, richly textured in toasted oak and supple tannin.

9334,Round Pond 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Tangy red fruit sits atop leathery texture in this dark, brooding wine, blended with 13% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec.

9342,Hawk Watch Winery 2011 Signature Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (South Coast),"From the relatively hot South Coast comes a big, powerful, chewy wine, with aromas of dried blackberries, light leather, some smoke and purple flowers. The real heft is on the palate, where sour tar is laced through stewed black plums, dark chocolate and herbs like dill and oregano. The tannins are a bit stiff.",62.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9345,Krupp Brothers 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard M5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This combines a majority of Cabernet with 4% Malbec for a huge, powerfully made wine, aged almost two years in French oak. It is named for the block from which it is sourced atop the mighty Stagecoach. It's reflective in leathery tobacco and cedar and fully concentrated with flushes of dark chocolate and caramel. Drink now through 2022.",165.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178

9393,Davies 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From vineyards on Diamond Mountain as well as Atlas Peak and Calistoga, this majority Cabernet employs 7% Petit Verdot, giving it a tad more weight and tannin.

9395,Eberle 2012 Eberle Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Coming from Gary Eberle's pioneering, 31-year-old vineyard, this presents fresh blueberries, smoke, cedar and a hearty mocha touch on the nose.

9397,Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 555 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From an estate in Rutherford that can't be named, this delightfully balanced Cab offers succulent plum, black olive, raspberry and cinnamon to great effect, melding the myriad sides of its personality well.

9526,World's End 2013 Crossfire Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"From a tremendous site, Crossfire displays bold, brawny and extracted black fruit, from blackberry to black currant. Polished tannins still need time to mellow, suggesting further time in the cellar, through 2023. A strong streak of brushy sage, cedar and menthol rises midway on the wine, peaking on the finish.",112.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9537,Den Hoed 2012 Andreas Wallula Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"The aromas start out quite brooding, opening to reveal notes of green pepper, vanilla, wood spice, powdered cayenne and dark cherry. The flavors are lithe and polished, with cherry, vanilla and coffee interweaving throughout to an extended finish. It comes off as oak heavy but still impresses.",80.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178

9552,William Church 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scents of bacon fat from the new French oak introduce a tight young wine. The cured meat aromas and flavors somehow suggest a splash of Syrah in the blend, though none is noted.

9612,Hess Collection 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"True to its advocacy for Malbec in the Napa Valley, the producer adds 15% Malbec to this Cabernet Sauvignon, forging a dark, rich and intense wine that's generous in black fruit and tobacco.

9630,Paul Hobbs 2007 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An ultrarich Cabernet whose ripe fruit is as elaborate as you can get. Ditto for the soft, plush tannins and the wealth of fine, sweet oak. Despite the wealth of blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cola flavors, it's not a wine to drink now, because the tannins and acids are so pert. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",235.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
9648,Hall 2007 Ellie's Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for.

9656,Etude 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Enormously rich and ripe in blackberry jam, cherry pie and chocolate flavors, this 100% varietal wine defines Napa Valley Cabernet, in the modern style.

9674,Swanson 2010 Instant Napa Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"It's not clear what Swanson means by the word “instant,” although this blend, which contains some Merlot and Petit Verdot, is rich enough in blackberries, cherries and mocha to enjoy now. It's also a complex wine, layered withNapa tannins and an opulent overlay of new French oak. Give it a good, long decanting and drink over the next six years.",60.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
9687,Castillo's Hillside Shire 2013 Shire View Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Clara Valley),"Dried fruit aromas of prune, fig and nearly raisin show on the nose of this red, which is enhanced by savory touches of salt, pepper and leather. There is a pleasant rustic quality to the sip, but a strong bitterness reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate, underripe plum skins and coffee grinds arises midpalate and doesn't dissipate.",72.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
9726,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Very smooth, yet mouth-drying with firm tannins, this Cabernet is a bit lean, but it defines the elegance that Napa is capable of. The blackberry and currant flavors are balanced by earthier notes of green olives, cola and dried herbs, while the oak is subtle, even though it's all new. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, and the alcohol level is a moderate 13.6%. Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it will improve in the bottle over the next eight years.",75.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178

9734,Hall 2010 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Softness of texture and extremely ripe fruit characterize this Cabernet Sauvignon, which has a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's huge in extracted blackberries and raspberries, while caramelized new oak adds to the impression of overall richness. Not showing much finesse now, just power, but it should age well; try after 2018.",125.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9741,Alpha Omega 2010 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard North Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Like its Tokalon South counterpart, this 100% has a funky, bacon and green olive aroma that persists through the finish. That does not detract from the blackberries and black cherries, but gives them an earthy complexity. The wine is a little on the soft side, but still should develop bottle notes after 2018.",150.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9742,Alpha Omega 2010 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine is dry, rich and a perfect representation of a modern Napa Cabernet. Shows intricate layers of black cherries, black and red currants, cassis and minerals, with the funky layer of bacon and olives that the winery's other 2010 Cabs display. Way too young to drink now. Should begin to open after 2018 and hold its own for another decade.",140.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
9753,Canvasback 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Coming from a who's who of Red Mountain vineyards, the inaugural release of this brand from Duckhorn Vineyards offers generous notes of dark coffee, espresso bean, dark cherries, sage and vanilla, with a pleasing interplay between fruit and barrel (64% new French). The plum and coffee flavors are restrained in style, with well-integrated tannins.",40.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178

9826,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 Artemis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This has lots of ripe, plush blackberry, olive and dark chocolate flavors. It packs a punch that lasts into a long, spicy finish. Delicious, classy, and lovely to drink now, although it will evolve through at least 2018.",55.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
9895,J. Rickards 2012 Five Sisters Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, providing velvety tar and raspberry liqueur, remaining bright and fresh in a medium-bodied package.

9920,Baehner Fournier 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made by legendary Steve Clifton for a property owner just west of Happy Canyon, this wine shows pure purple fruit aromas of blackberry syrup and blueberry, enhanced by a sprig of spearmint.

9934,Beringer 1996 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",100.0,95,7,0.9989985700457178
9940,Stonegate 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time.",25.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178

9987,Kuleto Estate 2012 El Coyote Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish.",80.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
10002,Paradise Ridge 2003 Rockpile Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Tastes more like a Zin than a Cab, with rustic tannins and a peppery, briary flavor of wild berries. The wine is dry, but way too soft for any development, so drink now.",38.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
10010,Martin & Weyrich 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Not very successful, especially at this price. It's showing the weaknesses of Paso Cabernet. Although there's obviously ripe fruit, the wine has an awkward mouthfeel, with semisweet fruit flavors that finish with a green, peppermint jelly note.",35.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
10040,Dumas Station 2010 Minnick Hills Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This reserve is only occasionally produced. A stunning wine, it's tight and packed with raspberry and cherry fruit that show great concentration, well-balanced acidity and ripe tannins.

10049,Scroll 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Medium-strength, this wine opens with a bouquet of black cherry and raspberry, unveiling an intensity of smoke and heat as it goes. Cradled in oak, it flattens on the midpalate before rising in strength and length on the finish.",54.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
10050,Sculpterra 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A mix of dried and fresh blueberry notes arises on the nose of this wine, alongside gravel and soft cedar elements. It's very purple on the palate, with more blueberry, olallieberry and grape candy, proving tasty but not especially complex. The tannins keep it firm.",36.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178

10101,Jacob Williams 2010 Eagle Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This rough and tumble Cabernet is oaky and smoky in both scent and flavor. It's a rustic, country wine, big and bold and raw around the edges, but packed with flavor.",35.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
10131,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open.",50.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178
10150,Frank Family 2012 Winston Hill Vineyard Patriarch Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A 100% varietal, single-vineyard estate wine, at the top of the producer's heap, this was given almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the other half once-filled. Juicy, it offers refined layers of herb, currant and clove, making for a soft, complex and lightly spicy experience. With sizable structure and depth, it can be enjoyed now through 2022.",225.0,93,7,0.9989985700457178

10179,Barons V 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is aged in 100% new American oak, putting tight berry and cassis flavors behind plenty of dried herb notes and astringent tannins. Fine for drinking with a thick steak, but not so much for sipping on its own.",45.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178

10221,Mark Ryan 2014 Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% varietal with the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Phinny Hill vineyards. Expressive but still wound-up aromas of exotic spice, French oak, chocolate and dark fruit are followed by pitch-black fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It's not yet ready to fully reveal its charms but has the stuffing to go the distance.",65.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
10259,BonAnno 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors abound in this dry, tannic Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows Napa Valley class, and with 6,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",20.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
10287,Écluse 2009 Reserve Lock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"The trick to getting a Cabernet Sauvignon this ripe and oaky is to provide balance, and in this, Écluse has succeeded. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's enormously rich in blackberries and black currants, with dark chocolate, licorice and spice adding complexity. The tannins are, in a word, gorgeous. With high alcohol, the mouthfeel has a Cognac-like warmth, but doesn't feel uncomfortably hot. Drink now for fresh fruitiness.",69.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
10305,Seven Hills 2010 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Crafted from the oldest vines in one of the oldest vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley, this displays lovely aromatics of leaf, herb, earth and wild berry.

10308,Vermeil 2009 Jean Louis Vermeil Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Expensive, yes, but very fine, notable for a lovely structure and ripe, complex flavors that should develop in the cellar. It's dry, smoothly tannic and awesomely rich with blackberries and currants, and a gorgeous application of sweet new oak. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 10 years.",85.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
10318,Municipal Winemakers 2007 Best Barrel Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Tasted in the late summer of 2010, this Cab was pretty tannic and acidic, despite some very rich and dynamic blackberry, black cherry, currant and licorice flavors.

10324,Silver Lake 2007 Girly Girl Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.",19.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
10435,Stags' Leap Winery 2010 The Leap Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This 100% Cabernet is delicious, but it's a shadow of what this winery used to be, and shows little Stags Leap character. Made to appeal to the popular style of softness, sweet fruit and oakiness, it has rich flavors of blackberry jam and buttered toast. Drink now.",80.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
10438,Bell 2010 Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Despite some hard tannins, this is an approachable wine for drinking now with barbecue, roasts and cheeses.

10460,Keating 2011 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"A severe edge of dried herb and savoriness in this single-vineyard Cab evolves into juicy black currant and cassis midway through.

10468,Waterstone 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Big, firm tannins frame this wine, blended with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec.

10476,Occasio 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Juicy with ripe tannins, it tastes lovingly hand-crafted, detailed and focused in black currant, berry and leather.

10548,Joel Gott 2012 815 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat.",18.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
10560,Caricature 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarksburg),"Stylish oak aromas combine with rich fruit flavors in this full-bodied, velvet-textured wine. It smells like ripe black cherries, vanilla and caramel, with a fruit-forward palate. Made by the Lange Twins Winery.",16.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
10573,Murphy-Goode 2012 Single Deck Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From a single, high-elevation block of the Alden-Ellis Vineyard, this is somewhat muted aromatically, preferring to present itself in waves of oak and cigar box.

10578,Smith & Hook 2010 Westside Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"There are very savory aromas on this wine, with campfire smoke and herb-crusted game dominating the boysenberry fruit in the background.

10761,Adelaida 2011 Viking Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Fresh and vibrant aromas of dark cherry and purple flowers get serious weight from a touch of tar on this very balanced, tighter Cabernet.

10773,En Garde 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Holding its wines in barrel and bottle longer than most before release, En Garde's Cabernet shows ample, leathery tannin that will benefit from further aging, in addition to being hedonistically enjoyable now.

There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.",60.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
11004,Honig 2007 Campbell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This 100% Cabernet's dark, saturated color testifies to its extracted ripeness and richness. It's a gigantic wine, buried at the moment under smoky oak, but tremendous underneath in blackberry, cherry, currant, sweet herb, violet and cured meat flavors. A big success even in this vintage. Now, with decanting, and through 2019.",75.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
11013,Alpha Omega 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's a tannic toughness to this young wine. It's like chewing on dried black currants. Once they start to dissolve in the mouth, lovely flavors of sweet blackberries emerge, and then take over through a very long, spicy finish. It's quite a beautiful Napa Cabernet, but it does need time. Best 2013–2019.",82.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
11016,Domaine Degher 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Lusty and fleshy, a fat, opulently flavored young Cab offering huge amounts of ripe Paso fruit. Floods the mouth with soft, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and sandalwood.",34.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
11058,CK Mondavi 2013 Wildcreek Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Very focused and pure fruit aromas and flavors give this medium-bodied wine a tasty and straightforward personality. The texture is relaxed due to soft acidity and tannins, and everything tastes fresh and clean.",7.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
11070,Rutherford Grove 2009 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"The fruit has veered somewhat funky and stewy here, giving the wine a soft, lean quality that struggles to share its quiet undertones of cherry and vanilla.",55.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
11081,Baron Herzog 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"With blackberry, blueberry, currant and tobacco flavors that finish dry and smoothly tannic, this is a sound Cabernet for drinking now. For the quality and price, this is an attractive selection for entertaining.",13.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
11105,Arbios 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Tobacco and some green pepper on an otherwise fruity plain. When you think of cru bourgeois Bordeaux, this fits the image and flavor profile. It's lean, but balanced. Tea and licorice are definable on the finish.",35.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
11123,Faust 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a soft, earthy wine, with dried herb and currant flavors. It comes down on the subtle side, with a bit of oak influence adding richness to the wine's otherwise dry texture. Drink soon.",55.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
11130,Billsboro 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Black fruit and cherry leads on this balanced red. Flavors of black pepper, black currant and plum on the palate are round but not overbearing. A good daily red to pair with pastas, stews and meat dishes.",20.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11135,Shaw 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"This wine has a nose of black fruits, mocha and toffee, and on the palate, warming spices, tart cherry and a touch of sweetness. The flavors aren't overly complex, but the wine is appealing, and the finish lingering.",35.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11183,Hamilton 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is clean and almost delicate, with cranberry fruit, red licorice, dry leaves and drying tannins. It fades rather quickly, but would make a nice companion to a simple skirt steak.",28.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
11230,Peachy Canyon 2012 ChillHouse Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A juicy wine certain to please those who opt for the hip label, this is quite showy on the nose, with densely packed blackberries, clove, caramel and vanilla elements. The rich palate is equally poppy and boisterous, with black cherry jam, allspice and nutmeg notes.",19.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
11293,Tin Barn 2013 Pickberry Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Bold, succulent black cherry and currant flavors combine with softer, more elegant notions of graphite, coffee and clove in this well-made, full-bodied, 100% varietal wine. Volcanic soils comprise the Sonoma Mountain slope where the vineyard is located, contributing a gravelly hint of reduction.",52.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11300,Kenwood 2012 Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Woody, herbal and integrated in oak and tannin, this wine comes from grapes grown in both Sonoma Valley estate vineyards and sites in Alexander and Knights valleys. Red currant, graphite and clove flavors highlight its medium-bodied density.",75.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11322,Mansion Creek 2008 Waldheim Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Thin and tart, with aggressively astringent tannins. There is a noticeable scent and flavor of rubber as well.",24.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
11328,Stone Edge Farm 2007 Surround Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Too sweet by far, like melted cherry and blackberry jam, with heat from alcohol and a hit of acidity. Drink up.",30.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
11335,Carmenet 2009 Vintner's Collection Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Sugary sweet in berry-cherry fruit, with a cut of acidity that doesn't feel natural. An awkward wine, but passable.",12.0,82,7,0.9989985700457178
11349,Peltier 2011 Peltier Station Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Opening with aromas of barbecued meat, this soft Cab is all about ripe, meaty tannins and smoky oak over any suggestion of fruit, which is hidden among its cedar and tobacco-lined walls.",18.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11350,Cable Car 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A soft, basic Cabernet, it offers meaty cinnamon and berry-plum flavors.",13.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11368,Broadside 2012 Margarita Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip.",20.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
11415,Edge 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is one of the best buys on the market now for a Cabernet of this quality at this price. It's a wonderful wine, well structured and dry, with lush flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and cedar that are wrapped into firm, ripe tannins. Should develop additional complexity through 2014.",20.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11445,Starfield 2012 The Starbeam Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft in classic layers of cinnamon and clove, this wine is almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with a wealth of black plum and blackberry constituting its inner soul. The finish lingers in black pepper and more of that opening spice.",65.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
11478,Dachshund 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Full bodied, and firm textured, this wine emphasizes complexity and mouthfeel over simple fruitiness. It smells like ripe plums, tastes like cardamom and black cherry, and shows good balance between flavors, acidity and body.",14.0,88,7,0.9989985700457178
11517,Hourglass 2009 Blueline Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, tannic, midnight black Cabernet, rude in youth and barely drinkable. The tannins are powerful enough to lock down the palate. The grapes, grown in Calistoga, are very ripe in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, but those tannins are stubbornly astringent. Almost old-fashioned in toughness despite very high alcohol, it's a curiosity that seems likely to develop in the cellar, but with so little evidence of past vintages, all bets are off.",125.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
11534,Alpha Omega 2010 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine is dry, rich and a perfect representation of a modern Napa Cabernet. Shows intricate layers of black cherries, black and red currants, cassis and minerals, with the funky layer of bacon and olives that the winery's other 2010 Cabs display. Way too young to drink now. Should begin to open after 2018 and hold its own for another decade.",140.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
11535,Alpha Omega 2010 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Like the winery's other 2010 Cabs, this 100% varietal wine is dry, soft and densely packed. In this case the flavors suggest Oakville's black currants and cassis liqueur, with notes of violets, dried herbs and minerals. The tannins are finely ground, almost chalky, but still quite astringent. Should negotiate the next 10 years effortlessly.",140.0,91,7,0.9989985700457178
11552,Novelty Hill 2010 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the winery's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens rather stiff and herbal. It's a taut, dark and deep wine that rewards decanting, showing good concentration and dense layers of brambly berries, licorice and espresso. Age for at least another decade.",30.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11555,Ramey 2013 Annum Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry.",100.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
11576,B Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This 100% varietal wine from the Lewelling Vineyard is a blockbuster, providing a showy demonstration of ripe richness that's gorgeously lush. Christmas plum pudding, clove and cinnamon lurk behind a chalky underbelly of firm tannin and black licorice, finishing fresh in the glass.",108.0,94,7,0.9989985700457178
11596,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This opens with a strong sense of coconut that abruptly hits pomegranate and cranberry on the palate. The sweetness of the coconut dissipates on the finish, which veers slightly sour.",75.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11626,Paradise Ridge 2003 Ladi's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Soft and dull, with blackberry and cherry jam and sweet vanilla flavors. The tannins and acids both are low. Not going anywhere.",28.0,82,7,0.9989985700457178
11638,Pianetta 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey),"Just barely acceptable, this soft, semisweet Cab has Lifesaver candy flavors of cherries and raspberries.",28.0,80,7,0.9989985700457178
11641,Chimney Rock 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Chimney Rock continues a successful string of vintages with this powerful '05. It's a distinguished wine that calls to mind the description of Stags Leap Cabernet as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Rich and full-bodied, it has lush flavors of black currants and smoky new oak. Easy to find, with 28,000 cases produced. Drink now through 2012.",58.0,92,7,0.9989985700457178
11657,Flora Springs 2014 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Big-boned and soft, this reserve-tier wine is savory and serene, with forest flavors of wild mushroom. Soy, dried herb, sage and black currant notes pepper the scene.",150.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11659,Frank Family 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Brightly perfumed with violet aromas, this is a soft, round and voluptuously lush red wine. Full-bodied, it shows leather and baked black cherry notes.",53.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11683,Brander 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Despite lots of ripe black cherry, blueberry and plum flavors, this is a fairly rustic wine, with some edgy tannins making it feel prickly. A bit sweet, it will pair up with Mexican beef and pork dishes.",28.0,85,7,0.9989985700457178
11696,Martin Estate 2007 Collector's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A good 100% Cabernet, with complex, pleasant cherry, blackberry and oak flavors. Quite tannic now, with a sandpapery mouthfeel, and very full-bodied. Feels a little ponderous, but could be going through an awkward phase. Try again after 2013.",120.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
11702,L'Ecole No. 41 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit for this Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from a dozen different vineyards, blended into a firm, purely varietal example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon. The rich aromatics of black fruits, baking spices, dust, and cocoa powder roll into a full-flavored midpalate, enhanced with a light floral component.",30.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
11742,Chronic Cellars 2009 Ricardo Grande Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Zinfandel, this is a rustic wine. The fruit is strong and ripe, and the firm tannins and dusty spices suggest pairing with robust grilled meats and poultry.",35.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11747,Arrow Creek 2010 Coastal Series Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This soft, simple wine has minty, vegetal flavors alongside jammy blackberries. It's also aggressive in acidity.",18.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
11750,Daniel Gehrs 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"A tough wine to praise, although it's certainly drinkable with burgers and such if you're not fussy. It tastes thin and green, with blackberry and mint flavors that are sweet and sour on the finish.",20.0,83,7,0.9989985700457178
11775,Obelisco Estate 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Tight and tart, this offers crisp and spicy flavors of raspberry fruit, with a sharpness to the flavors. About one-quarter of the barrels were new and deliver highlights of toast and chocolate.",50.0,87,7,0.9989985700457178
11799,Fuse 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This Cabernet Sauvignon also blends in Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, combining for a straightforward red wine experience offering blackberry and raspberry juiciness. Plenty of toasty character tinged by tobacco is provided by the oak.",32.0,86,7,0.9989985700457178
11822,Maddalena 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This soft, simple Cabernet will go just fine with everyday fare. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, currants and smoky oak.",20.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11823,San Simeon 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"There's a toughness to the mouthfeel of this Cab. It's mainly from the tannins, which are hard and angular. The wine is very rich and fruity with flavors of black currants. Ready to drink now.",25.0,84,7,0.9989985700457178
11838,Vermeil 2010 Pickett Road Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Defines the yummy-delicious modern style of Napa Cabernet, with wave after wave of sweet blackberry jam, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors.

11856,Tulpen 2009 Dryland Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This new cuvée features grapes from both Tokar and Yellowbird vineyards, located out in the Mill Creek region east of downtown Walla Walla. It's close enough to the Blue Mountains to allow for this experiment in dry-farmed (non-irrigated) grapes. Flavors are distinctive, showing wild berries, cola, grain and herb.",42.0,89,7,0.9989985700457178
11882,Vellum 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a handful of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine is on the cooler-climate side of the sensory equation, a note of pencil and olive here, a bit of juicy cranberry there. Chalky tannins complete the picture, the wine balanced and medium to light in weight.",75.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11883,Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"There's no mistaking the variety with this wine's aromas of dried and fresh savory herbs, poblano, coffee, dark chocolate and cherry, accented by earthy undertones. The palate is deft while showing good depth of flavor and persistence.",38.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
11893,Jack 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A smidgen of Cabernet Franc is blended into this wine, the grapes sourced from vineyards on both Diamond and Howell mountains. Ripe raspberry and cassis compote give it a juicy expansiveness on the midpalate, before finishing accented in cedar and pencil shavings within a complex wave of dry tannin.",100.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178

12017,Amavi 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Smooth and supple, Amavi's 2005 Cabernet includes a healthy bit of Syrah, which adds details of spice and pepper to the smooth and supple cassis and black cherry fruit. Tannins are ripe and well-defined, and the wine carries subtle suggestions of olive and tea. It's focused and bright, polished and immediately delicious, though it could certainly cellar for a few years.",25.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
12021,Arbor Crest 2004 Wahluke Slope Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"This has a gorgeous nose redolent with dried spices and hints of incense. The moderate (13.8%) alcohol is a joy, and the use of oak (half new) is just right. The Cabernet character comes through, with a slightly herbal/black olive edge, but it is wrapped in toast and sweet baking spices, and balanced through a very smooth and surprisingly long finish.",30.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178

12027,Dunham 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon X Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.",45.0,90,7,0.9989985700457178
