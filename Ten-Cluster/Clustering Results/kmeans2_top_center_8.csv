5428,Iron Horse 1995 Russian Cuvée  (Sonoma County),"Light straw in color, with fine bubbles and pure, fine aromas of peach and strawberry. In the mouth, it’s exceptionally rich and creamy. It’s not quite as sweet as an extra dry Champagne, but it’s definitely heading in that direction.",26.0,89,8,0.9863181651457524
5441,Handley 1995 Brut  (Anderson Valley),"From a bubbly specialist comes this fancy wine, a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Has very forward fruity aromas that are a combo of both varietals. It’s a bit rough, as though the bubbles aren’t fine enough, but that’s comparing it to the best French vintage Champagne, which costs a whole lot more.",25.0,88,8,0.9863181651457524
9168,Handley 1995 Blanc de Blancs  (Anderson Valley),"From one of California’s coolest growing regions, the grapes nonetheless achieved the ripeness of white peaches, lending those notes to the aromas and flavors. It’s very clean and refreshing. There’s a nice toastiness that carries through to the finish, which is slightly sweet and bitter. To be released Spring 2001.",30.0,86,8,0.9863181651457524
39198,Thornton 1995 Brut Reserve Natural  (California),"Richer and more austere than the regular brut, and bone dry, it has a steely elegance. The aromas are delicate but suggest citrus fruits and a touch of strawberry. It’s very well balanced, with crisp acidity. There’s just the slightest hint of fruit on the finish, and then it turns dry and austere again.",35.0,87,8,0.9863181651457524
47897,Sakonnet 1995 Samson Brut  (Southeastern New England),A full-flavored but light-bodied sparkler that has some toasty elements over lemon-tangerine fruit. The long finish brings some attractive pink grapefruit notes. A very welcome surprise from this Rhode Island winery.,25.0,90,8,0.9863181651457524
47901,Thornton 1995 Brut Reserve  (California),"This is probably the most crowd-pleasing of Thornton’s current lineup. It has all the elegance and class of the Brut Reserve Natural but a touch of sugar adds roundness and richness to the fruit. It’s more savory, more piquant, fatter, without being blowsy or obvious. This is very fine brut, able to hold its own with the best.",21.0,90,8,0.9863181651457524
60256,Pacific Echo 1995 Blanc de Blancs  (Anderson Valley),"Right on target, the toasty, smoky nose here opens to full green-apple and mineral flavors on the palate. Hints of apricot and lime add interest and complexity, and the wine finishes smooth and long. Shows nice precision of flavor and texture.",27.0,89,8,0.9863181651457524
77057,Iron Horse 1995 Brut Rosé  (Sonoma County),"Here is a very pretty pale-salmon-colored sparkling wine, with fine, zesty bubbles and an appealing whiff of Pinot Noir in the nose. The flavors are pure strawberry, a tiny bit sweet but not too much. This is the sort of sparkling wine even people who say they don’t like wine will fall in love with.",30.0,90,8,0.9863181651457524
77062,Iron Horse 1995 Vrais Amis  (Sonoma County),"An enormously fruity sparking wine, this one offers complex aromas of raspberries and baked bread, with a hint of lime. It really comes alive in the mouth, thanks to refreshing acidity and fine bubbles that scour the palate. This clean wine has just enough of a dose of sweetness to prod the fruit forward. Only 125 cases produced.",26.0,90,8,0.9863181651457524
77071,Iron Horse 1995 Classic Vintage Brut  (Sonoma County),"A very pale straw color precedes great aromas of peach and apple, with notes of oak, baking bread and white chocolate. It’s delicately fruity in the mouth, with crisp acidity and the pleasant scour of bubbles. This is a clean, elegant wine of great finesse.",26.0,89,8,0.9863181651457524
82465,Renwood 1995 Vintage Port Port (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Awkward, opening with vegetal aromas that turn cloyingly sweet in the mouth. It's also a very acidic wine. Not offering much charm now.",22.0,83,8,0.9863181651457524
88369,Pacific Echo 1995 Private Reserve Brut  (Anderson Valley),"A malty, full bouquet with good complexity announces this well-constructed wine. Pleasant citrus and hay flavors, medium weight and a good steady bead add to the package. A good clean finish with a grapefruit tang wraps it up.",31.0,88,8,0.9863181651457524
6033,Iron Horse 1996 Joy! Rosé Sparkling (Green Valley),"This Brut-style wine feels extraordinarily refined in the mouth, with a silky, airy texture. The flavors of toffee, butterscotch, orange marmalade and vanilla bean are rich, but balanced with yeasty bitterness and bright acidity. Gorgeous to drink now, anywhere, anytime, with practically anything. Pricey, yes, but worth it for special occasions.",160.0,94,8,0.9861271836406683
16823,Handley 1996 Brut Rosé  (Anderson Valley),"This is a beautiful wine to look at for the coppery-gold color and the fierce explosion of fine bubbles. Smells luscious, with subtle raspberry, lime, bread and lees aromas. This is the best rosé Handley has ever produced: amazingly rich, long and full-bodied, with the creamy smoothness of Champagne.",25.0,92,8,0.9861271836406683
17120,Columbia Crest 1996 Estate Series Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Flavors of plum, cherry, cassis, chalky earth, smoke and bell pepper. Still tight and chewy, with suggestions that the fruit from this difficult vintage didn’t attain full ripeness. A good effort from a subpar year, marked by a hint of brett on the finish.",16.0,87,8,0.9861271836406683
27789,Duck Pond 1996 Sparkling Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is something you're not likely to see every day—a 10-year-old sparkling wine made from 100% Pinot Gris. Lacks the finesse and minerality of those Alsatian sparkling wines, but the flavors have been smoothed out over the years, and a pleasing toasty streak has crept into the tart pear skin fruit.",25.0,86,8,0.9861271836406683
30368,S. Anderson 1996 Brut  (Napa Valley),"This is quite a strong, toasty and fruit-forward bubbly that could stand to be a little more elegant. It has overt aromas and flavors of strawberry and lime, with a pretty edge of coconut and vanilla. Finishes clean and zesty, but loses a few points because of a rough edge to the mouthfeel.",28.0,86,8,0.9861271836406683
47903,Mumm Cuvée Napa 1996 DVX  (Napa Valley),"This prestige cuvee honors Guy Devaux, who founded the California winery, and takes the familiar, user-friendly house style to an unprecedented level of intensity. The concentrated, beguiling nose suggests cask-conditioned ale and freshly baked bread. The wine fills every corner of the palate with rich, seductively layered flavors. The finish says California, not Champagne, with its tart fruit and spice.",50.0,89,8,0.9861271836406683
60254,Argyle 1996 Knudsen Vineyard Brut  (Willamette Valley),"Argyle sets the standard for Northwest sparkling wine, and this wine beguiles from the beginning. The massive bead, citrus-scented bouquet and perfect fruit is balanced elegantly by palate-clearing acids and just a hint of toast. The wine is a 100% barrel-fermented blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay.",35.0,89,8,0.9861271836406683
60638,Argyle 1996 Brut  (Willamette Valley),"For those who like a very dry wine with lots of yeasty, baked-bread aromas, this one’s for you. In addition to those aromas are notes of lime and raspberry, although they’re understated. The flavors are modulated, too, just suggesting strawberries, but the emphasis here is on texture and acidity.",22.0,87,8,0.9861271836406683
60650,Argyle 1996 Knudsen Vyd Julia Lee's Block Blanc de Blancs  (Willamette Valley),"This pioneering Oregon producer makes a fine, fruity, yeasty sparkling wine from 100% Chardonnay grapes. It’s crisp and lively in the mouth, with medium bubbles and a fresh, citrusy finish.",30.0,87,8,0.9861271836406683
66102,Beringer 1996 Nightingale White (North Coast),"Decades ago, Beringer’s then-winemaker Myron Nightingale created an artificial method of introducing the botrytis to Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, with great results. This splendid version has strong aromas of crème brûlée, vanilla custard, honey, apricot purée and a warm note of peach pie fresh out of the oven. The taste is, in a word, fabulous. This is a nectar fit for the gods.",30.0,93,8,0.9861271836406683
77067,S. Anderson 1996 Blanc de Noirs  (Napa Valley),"There’s a distinct onion-skin color, and you can smell the Pinot Noir in the raspberry and strawberry aromas that are accented with white chocolate and toasty spices. Rather full-bodied, lush and opulent. There’s something almost syrupy about it, in a good way. But it’s still crisp and dry, and has a Champagne lightness.",28.0,90,8,0.9861271836406683
88379,Schramsberg 1996 Blanc de Noirs  (Napa Valley),"Schramsberg did a good job with this wine, creating a lush sparkler with generous cascading bubbles, firm Pinot fruit and a tight, spicy finish. This is still hard and even a little bitter at the end; more time in the bottle will bring out all the richness locked inside.",29.0,87,8,0.9861271836406683
88389,Château Frank 1996  Finger Lakes,"It begins with classic brut aromas of citrus, peach and strawberry, with oak, smoke and yeast shadings. But it’s surprisingly sweet. Well made and clean, with crisp acidity and nice restraint to the fruit. But those expecting a drier wine will be disappointed.",20.0,85,8,0.9861271836406683
5432,Robert Hunter 1994 Brut de Noirs  (Sonoma Valley),"Has bright, focused aromas, including lime and raspberry, with nutty, smoky bread dough and yeast. Very clean, with a pronounced kiss of sweet berry fruit. Finishes slightly sweet.",30.0,88,8,0.9859343276623225
5436,Handley 1994 Blanc De Blancs  (Anderson Valley),"Starts with a nice gold-straw color and lots of fine, tiny bubbles. The aroma is rich and creamy, marked by pear and apple notes, vanilla and bread dough. Very dry, with evident ripe fruit and a dry, leesy finish. The texture’s a bit rough, but this may age out in a few years.",25.0,88,8,0.9859343276623225
60251,Woodbridge 1994 Portacinco Port (California),"A blend of five traditional Port varieties, this is a sweet (10% residual sugar), very rich wine of substance and harmony. It has massive flavors of berries with sweet overlays of caramel, chocolate and mint, and the sugars are nicely balanced by crisp acidity, although the texture is soft and velvety. This tasty wine achieves the complexity and provides the satisfaction of a good late bottled vintage Port. Drink it now with rich chocolate-based desserts.",20.0,90,8,0.9859343276623225
60262,Roederer Estate 1994 L'Ermitage  (Anderson Valley),"Toasty and creamy, with just a touch of earthy mustiness on the nose; this is like a star just starting to do an elegant fade. There’s tangy fruit with a touch of oxidized maturity, a full texture, but a very faint bead. Good elements abound here and the wine still displays class, but it seems like it might have been brighter before",43.0,88,8,0.9859343276623225
77053,Korbel 1994 Le Premier Reserve  (Russian River Valley),"One of America’s favorite sparkling wine houses proves it’s still got the right moves. This brut-style wine, with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, begins with delicate but assertive aromas of strawberry and lime. It’s dry and crisp and elegant, with hints of berries and limes, but it’s most notable for its richness, balance, harmony and finesse. Goes down really easy.",22.0,90,8,0.9859343276623225
77066,S. Anderson 1994 Blanc de Blanc  (Napa Valley),"The lightest and most delicate of Anderson’s trio of bubblies this year, this 100% Chardonnay offers clean aromas of coconut, vanilla, lime peel and toast, and drinks fresh and lively. It’s also very dry, and finishes with a slightly bitter almond-skin note.",46.0,90,8,0.9859343276623225
88382,Laetitia 1994 Cuvée M  (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Earthy, with good fruit elements on the nose. The wine has many commendable aspects: a good bead and complex flavor elements. But the earthy, mushroom quality hinted at in the nose sits too heavily. Perhaps it’s getting on in years, as it seemed more vibrant when tasted last year.",30.0,86,8,0.9859343276623225
4257,Chateau Ste. Michelle 1997 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",23.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
4264,Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California),"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",18.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
4269,Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley),"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",25.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
4277,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",25.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
4278,Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros),"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",35.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
5431,Kenwood 1997 Nuns Canyon Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there’s some deeply scented blackberry. It seems crisper and more angular, and more tannic, with a great hidden depth of fruit that needs to be coaxed out through short-term aging.",20.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
5445,Fetzer 1997 Barrel Select Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"A nice young, jammy Zin with zesty aromas of blackberry jam and briary fruit, meaning it’s like the scent of wild berries on a hot summer day. A lovely wine with pretty fruit, but it’s most notable for the soft, plush, opulent tannins.",14.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
5448,Valley of the Moon 1997 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Hooray! A terrific Zin that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. It’s loaded with personality, with quintessential aromas and flavors of wild berries and spices, and added complexities of roasted coffeebean, anise and white chocolate. Best Buy.",15.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
7029,Yorkville Cellars 1997 Cabernet Franc (Yorkville Highlands),"This Bordeaux variety more often than not produces a light, fruity wine of charm and early drinkability. Here, the sour cherry fruit is framed in dry, dusty tannins and soft acids. There's an elegance and spicy aftertaste that are very nice. —S.H.",17.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
9922,Maison Basque 1997 Black Zinfandel Zinfandel (California),"Dark, brick colored wine, heavily oxidized, with nutty, smoky, Madeira-like flavors, and thick, dry tannins. An odd, raisiny approach to Zin.",24.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
9927,Meeker 1997 Gold Leaf Cuvee Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Plummy, ripe, beginning to oxidize. Ready to drink right now, it's got a leafy, tomato flavor to it. Unusual.",18.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
9930,Renwood 1997 Grandmére Zinfandel (Amador County),"Full blueberry and blackberry aromas can't overcome the off-putting, solvent-like elements on the nose here. Lots of alcohol, spice-cake and dark berry flavors, but not much finesse or texture mark this disappointing old-vine offering from this generally solid Zinfandel producer.",25.0,81,8,0.9851487050465235
9938,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1997 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now.",35.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235
9943,Kenwood 1997 Massara Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak. The tannins are soft and finely etched. Gorgeous stuff, quite lovely now, but the solid core of fruit indicates mid-term aging potential.",25.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
10981,Lake Sonoma 1997 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead.",17.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
10986,Peterson 1997 Bradford Mountain Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Firm, ripe and fruity, with a nice mix of plums, berries and earth. The mountain fruit shows good acids, some mineral elements, and a long, complex finish with a fair amount of earth and barnyard. A distinctive, earthy style.",21.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
10992,Storybook Mountain 1997 Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Blackberries are the story here, boatloads of rich, ripe, jammy blackberries. There is just a whiff of volatile acidity, then a wonderful mouthful of fruit with some stony earth underneath. Shows a light touch with the oak, good acids and a deft handling of the tannins.",50.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
12114,Terre Rouge 1997 Red (Sierra Foothills),"A bit rough and sharp, with earthy-jammy flavors and a peppery finish. It's a lightly structured wine with thin flavors and a bite of acidity, and dry. Calls for simple foods, the heartier the better. A Rhône blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah.",20.0,84,8,0.9851487050465235
15944,Kenwood 1997 Upper Weise Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Interesting cedar, game and leather notes accent this wine's blackberry and chocolate aromas and flavors. There's an almost Rhône-like quality to this full-bodied, well-balanced wine. Produced from a certified organic vineyard, the finish displays dark cherry and chocolate flavors with peppery accents.",15.0,86,8,0.9851487050465235
15958,Boeger 1997 Walker Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Thick, chewy, cherry fruit, with lots of wood behind it. Simple, forward and quite pleasant, without pretension.",18.0,85,8,0.9851487050465235
15961,Martin & Weyrich 1997 Dante Dusi Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Some earthy elements mingle with the fruit, which has a ripe tomato edge. Good structure, without the harshness or heat that affects so many '97s. If anything, it's a little underripe, with bell pepper, beet and earthy flavors.",22.0,85,8,0.9851487050465235
15966,Windsor 1997 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino),"A very oaky nose leads into a tough, tannic wine. There's good fruit under all the wood and tannin, and the tight, rugged finish should smooth out in time.",15.0,85,8,0.9851487050465235
16130,Frank Family 1997 Brut Champagne Sparkling (Carneros),"Frank Family, far better known for Cabernet Sauvignon, joins the sparkling wine sweepstakes with this drily crisp, Champagne-like brut. It has subtle flavors of raspberries, strawberries, limes and brioche pastry, with a complex finish. Quite good.",65.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
17118,Hogue 1997 Genesis Schwartzman Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"No oak here, thank you; just pure and delicious Riesling fruit with a hint of botrytis to add complexity to the apple-pear range of flavors. This dry-finished wine can hang with powerful chili-based dishes and is delightful as an aperitif.",13.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
17524,Gloria Ferrer 1997 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"This is the winery's most expensive bottling, a late disgorged bubbly that has now seen a decade of age. It shows the elegant polish of the '97 Royal Cuvée, but is superior even to it in richness. The creamy smoothness is the star attraction, but so are the subtle citrus, raspberry, brioche and vanilla flavors. Impeccably dry balance guarantees that this beautiful brut will age effortlessly for 10 years, if not longer.",50.0,95,8,0.9851487050465235
24647,Hanna 1997 Bismark Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Big, ripe, chocolaty wine, with lots of forward, smooth, oaky flavors. Easy to like, with a plush, creamy mouthfeel, and tons of new oak flavor.",45.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
24651,Beaulieu Vineyard 1997 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Lovely attack, plummy and evolved, with no rough edges. The fruit is soft and sweet, layered and full, and the overall palate impression is of elegance and balance. This is a terrific drink-me-now bottle with nicely aged flavors.",16.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
24659,Rodney Strong 1997 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods.",18.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
24664,Easton 1997 Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Lots of sharp-edged oak around a soft, plummy, chocolate-covered cherry of a wine. Smooth and easy-drinking, up to a fairly tannic finish. The acids keep everything in balance.",20.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
24666,Van Asperen 1997 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Raspberries, strawberries and blackberries, with smooth coffee and cream flavors streaking through the finish. Nicely made in a clean, classic Napa Zin style.",18.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
30369,Louis M. Martini 1997 Gnarly Vine Monte Rosso Vyd Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"From a famous vineyard, this is an interesting, even eccentric Zin. The aromas are claret-like, with currant and blackberry and a strong gamy note, like bacon. The fruit is very ripe, even overripe, and the tannins and acidity are ample. Fans of big, old-style Zins will love it.",40.0,86,8,0.9851487050465235
30381,Schramsberg 1997 Blanc de Blancs  (Napa Valley),"Golden delicious apple and pear aromas open this round, somewhat loosely knit wine. Tastes a bit sweet, and decidedly more ripe than anticipated, even a touch mature. Has a good bead and an orange note on the finish.",29.0,84,8,0.9851487050465235
33849,Rosenthal 1997 The Malibu Estate - The Devon Vineyard Merlot (Malibu-Newton Canyon),"A fine blend of ripe cherry, berry, spice and herb flavors, all framed in toasty oak and spice nuance. Smooth but bright on the palate, with a zippy finish and subtle earth tones at the end.",35.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
35704,Macari 1997 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.",19.0,80,8,0.9851487050465235
41852,Yorkville Cellars 1997 Petit Verdot (Yorkville Highlands),"This variety, not usually used on its own, has produced an inky dark wine of considerable power and ample tannins. The blackberry and rhubarb fruit has great depth, and is very dry. It's not a bad wine, but seems better suited as a blender to Cabernet Sauvignon. It just might be interesting in 6–8 years. —S.H.",17.0,86,8,0.9851487050465235
44339,AJB Vineyards 1997 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Bold, powerful aromas of white pepper and blackberry explode, with a more mature bouquet of dried rose petal and sweet cigar box. Soft, lush tannins frame pure, supple berry fruit. Perfect now. —S.H.",21.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
44411,Treana 1997 Red (Central Coast),"This eccentric blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Merlot, and Sangiovese achieves unusual finesse and complexity for a Paso Robles red wine. The aromas are of indeterminate wild berries, cassis, oak, and mint. Tastes very rich, dry and ripe, with gorgeous, sweet fruit, cocoa and spice. Tannins are soft and plump.",35.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
44413,Rodney Strong 1997 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Very aromatic for Merlot, with ripe, sugary blackberry and black- cherry aromas. Tastes deeply fruity and sweet, with plenty of berry flavor and a kiss of oak. Not especially complex, but the ripe sweetness and purity make it a very likable wine. Contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",16.0,88,8,0.9851487050465235
44424,Robert Mondavi 1997 Merlot (Carneros),"This is a dark-colored, dense wine, reeking of aromas fresh from the fermenting tank: juicy blackberry and plum and a strong herbal, earthy streak like mulch and mushrooms. It's well made and clean as a whistle, but currently the profile is austere, although some fruity depth on the finish bodes well for the long haul. Cellar for three years before trying.",35.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
46552,Signorello 1997 Padrone Red (Napa Valley),"Cassis liqueur, blueberry notes and a smoky cured-meat element comprise the nose of this engaging, beautifully balanced offering. Dried cherry, cedar, tea and tobacco flavors predominate, and the texture is supple. The long finish displays handsome cherry and coffee notes, with plentiful but even tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002.",125.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
46554,Robert Craig 1997 Affinity Red (Napa Valley),"Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state. Dusty tannins and sweet-and-sour black fruits on the long but tight finish close this appealing package.",44.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
47889,Merryvale 1997 Profile Red (Napa Valley),"Here’s a rich, solid Cab from a good winery with a proven track record. Made in the Bordeaux style, with 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc, it’s got ripe black-currant and plum aromas and flavors and a solid dose of toasty new French oak. Very balanced and complex. The tannins are soft enough to drink it tonight, but it can also age, if you want.",85.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
48087,Iron Horse 1997 T-bar-T Benchmark Red (Sonoma County),"Full and plush, with complex aromas of cassis, cinnamon, earth, cedar, coffee and cream. Low in acidity, it is large in depth of fruit and flavor, with black currants, earth and coffee reigning on the palate and into the finish. A sensuous texture and long finish with soft tannins complete the pleasure package. Very approachable; drink now through 2008.",50.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235
48098,Dominus 1997 Estate Bottled Red (Napa Valley),"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound. The finish is especially tight, with dry tannins and complex mineral and earth elements. Huge but refined, the quintessential iron fist in a velvet glove; it needs time.",100.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235
48099,Flora Springs 1997 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"With a sweet core of cherry fruit, plenty of tobacco and coffee nuances and other fine touches, this meritage blend hits the right chords and shows just the right weight. Deep, handsome, and fairly seamless; some light oak is applied skillfully, and in general the final product sings a pretty song.",45.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235
52223,Schramsberg 1997 J. Schram Late Disgorged 150th Anniversary Release Sparkling (Napa-Monterey-Mendocino),"This spectacular brut-style sparkler that's made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir still has plenty of tart acidity and yeastiness, providing the backdrop for rich, concentrated flavors of lime, raspberry, orange, brioche, mineral, vanilla and spice. It's enjoyable now, a tête de cuvée that is among the best California bubblies of the year, and it will continue to develop bottle complexity for many years.",200.0,96,8,0.9851487050465235
55908,Rodney Strong 1997 Symmetry Meritage (Alexander Valley),"This flamboyant wine won't let down fans of expensive, good vintage North Coast Cabs. It has it all, starting with almost aggressive new oak. If you're looking for flavor, you'll find it in the extracted blackberry and cassis fruit. The tannins are considerable. If it has a fault, it's softness. Drink within the next few years.",55.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
60639,Kenwood 1997 Mazzoni Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"It starts out with a pretty ruby-garnet color with hints of youthful purple, and also has youthful, vibrant aromas of freshly crushed black cherry, blackberry, clove and a distinct black-pepper note. In the mouth, it’s lively, soft and supple. The fruit is intense and so is the spice, and it’s very dry. Good stuff, although it lacks a certain depth.",20.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
60642,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 1997 Blanc de Blancs  (Finger Lakes),"This delightful surprise from upstate New York features Pinot Grigio-like lime and herb aromas. A touch of chalk and the faintest hint of peachy fruit on the palate add to its appeal. Displays good feel and finish, with lingering citrus flavors.",30.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
60648,Montevina 1997 Terra D'Oro Zinfandel (Amador County),"Here’s a light, softly fruity Zin that offers plenty of drinking pleasure. You won’t mistake this for a North Coast Zin. The tannin structure is missing, replaced by a velvety, plush texture. But there’s fruit aplenty, and spice, too.",16.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
62656,Buttonwood Farm 1997 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Herbaceousness marks this wine, which doesn't seem to be ripe enough. True, there are some pretty black-cherry and chocolate notes in the aroma that carry through in the mouth. But it drinks thin, although not rough, and there's a green chlorophyll note that no amount of aging will get rid of.",18.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
62661,Mirassou 1997 Coastal Selection Merlot (Monterey County),"If Monterey has a problem with Cabernet Sauvignon, the challenges for Merlot are even more formidable, as this tough, thin, earthy wine shows. These grapes just didn't get ripe enough. so the dominant notes are herbaceous and tannic. It also finishes watery.",13.0,81,8,0.9851487050465235
62666,M. Cosentino 1997 The Poet Red (Napa Valley),"Forward aromas of ripe cherries and deep vanillin oak meld nicely. Black plum, sweet cherry and coffee flavors, with cedar accents. The very full, supple mouthfeel is captivating. Shows fine length, spicy dry tannins and the stuffing to last. Hold four or more years, as it will keep for ages.",65.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235
64931,Dominus 1997 Napanook Vyd Red (Napa Valley),"Aromas almost of blackberry syrup, with herb, toast and earthy, even barnyardy accents open this rich yet tart cherry-chocolate wine. Smooth and unevolved, with chocolate and orange-peel notes on the austere finish. It's the baby brother of Dominus, offering a look at the style of the estate without the price tag of the flagship offering.",30.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
64936,Bacio Divino 1997 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Plum aromas are pounded home with notes of meat and menthol. When you next hear the word “opaque,” think of this. But the body is surprisingly svelte, and the flavors emphasize red fruit. Some tannins are manifested on the finish, which shows licorice and buttery oak.",75.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
64949,Livingston Moffett 1997 Gemstone Vineyard Red (Napa Valley),"Lots of inky, jammy aromas of black fruit set up the red-fruit palate that is covered with a blanket of powerful oak. Not a light-hearted cuvée; rather it's drying, concentrated and strong. With a few years of aging it could show additional subtleties.",75.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
65332,Cain 1997 Cain Five Red (Napa Valley),"This predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon blend could actually be Cain Four this year, as there's no Malbec in the blend. Large and taut, it displays tightly wrapped prune, toast, coffee and currant aromas. Possesses a handsome mouthfeel, with full tannins, tarry pine bark and a cocoa note on the palate and back end. An elegant bruiser, it needs three to four years to come around.",75.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
65339,Martin Ray 1997 Synthesis Diamond Mtn. Vyd. Red (Napa Valley),"Dark fruits, leather and game notes yield an almost Syrah-like nose that opens to chocolate, dark-berry and mineral flavors. Rich—even thick-textured—it is soft and quite approachable now, with fine, well-dispersed tannins. Finishes long, ultrablack, smooth and enjoyable. Drink now to 2007.",50.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
65342,Blackjack 1997 Harmonie Red (Santa Barbara County),"From a region not known for Cabernet comes a rich, tantalizing, luscious wine, with lots of cigar box/tobacco aromas and plenty of vibrant black fruit: currants and plums. Proper acidity drives the finish, leaving the mouth fairly refreshed. Has all the structure and balance one could ask for.",32.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
65343,Langtry 1997 Meritage Red (North Coast),"The bouquet is pretty big and dense, with some high-tone raspberry peeking through the surface. Black plum and cherry get help from licorice and vanilla on the palate. Zippy fruit is the signature, even as it does a nice, long fade.",50.0,91,8,0.9851487050465235
66100,Navarro 1997 Late Harvest Cluster Select White Riesling (Anderson Valley),"Old-gold in color, and thick and syrupy. The aromas run to caramel, apricots, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pecan pie and crème brûlée. Tastes as voluptuous as it smells. Fantastic concentration and depth; a nectar bursting with sweet, gorgeous fruit. The acidity is high, but it feels soft and creamy. Residual sugar of 28% makes it tooth-achingly sweet. Only 554 cases produced, but worth the search.",25.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235
74745,Iron Horse 1997 Joy! Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),"A triumph, really. Held back for 14 years and just recently disgorged, it's fantastically rich and complex, just oozing the most delicious orange, butterscotch, yeast and toast flavors. So silky, so sweet in fruit, and yet with a dry finish. Stands out in any tasting of the best sparklers. Hard to imagine a California bubbly better than this.",179.0,97,8,0.9851487050465235
77063,Iron Horse 1997 Wedding Cuvée Brut  (Green Valley),"This bubbly is simply irresistable, from the pale coppery color to the aromas of raspberries, limes, and apricots to the subtle fruity flavors. The texture is notable for its smooth creaminess, and the wine is dry and very clean. Superb balance suggests ageability, but it’s so delicious now, why wait? 91% Pinot Noir, 9% Chardonnay.",28.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
78858,Clos La Chance 1997 Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Cabernet Franc, used in Bordeaux blends and on its own in the Loire, is difficult to make into a complex wine in California. This bottling starts with aromas of black raspberry and spearmint, and drinks soft and fruity. It's a good wine, but on the simple side.",32.0,85,8,0.9851487050465235
78867,Nelson 1997 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma Valley),"A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.  Drinks on the lean side, with some spare, delicate berry fruit; it definitely needs food to bring out its best qualities.  Very dry.",24.0,84,8,0.9851487050465235
84035,Camelot 1997 Merlot (California),"A soft, round quaffer filled with warmth. Slightly cooked berries are tinged with a hint of wood and dusty earth flavors",10.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
86529,Gallo of Sonoma 1997 Frei Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With its bouquet of black plum, leather and dried herb notes, this lean Zin has good berry fruit. However, its attributes are balanced by a note of volatile acidity on the nose, and it shows some definite heat in the mouth. The narrow, rather angular structure of the wine seems to constrain the blackberry and spice flavors here. Closes with full, fairly even tannins.",19.0,84,8,0.9851487050465235
86534,Newlan 1997 Wallstrum Family Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Starts out nice, with a good, fruity raspberry nose, but on the palate are tastes of tomatoes, with a dry, astringent, tannic finish.",20.0,83,8,0.9851487050465235
86536,Joullian 1997 Zinfandel (Carmel Valley),"A very interesting wine from a rarely-seen appellation. The fruit is distinctly wild berry—huckleberry maybe—with spice and good acid. But the finish has a bitter, metallic note that lingers unpleasantly.",20.0,83,8,0.9851487050465235
88609,Horton 1997 Vintage Port (Virginia),"This vintage Port-style wine is warming and full of comforting flavors. Cooked prune, raisin, coffee and spices fill your senses. It feels lucious and smooth, but has lively acidity as well. It would be a lovely accompaniment to a cozy night beside the fire.",45.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
88773,Milliaire 1997 Clockspring Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right.",18.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
88774,Sausal 1997 Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Old-vine straw, tobacco and herb in the nose. The wine is subtle, sensual and complex, with layers of interesting spicy flavor. Nicely balanced and flavorful, with a long, firm finish.",22.0,90,8,0.9851487050465235
88788,Mazzocco 1997 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows. The nose is lushly scented with plums, raisins, pie cherries and ripe red fruits, with some of that distinctive new mown hay quality that old vines send up. A little barnyard aroma too, in a good way. Very extracted and intense.",16.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
91452,Spring Mountain Vineyard 1997 Miravalle-La Perla-Chevalier Red,"To say the least, it comes out guns blazing and oozing mountain character. Animal and barnyard, coffee and earth, even burnt toast and smoky bacon are all over this wine. Fruit definitely plays second fiddle to the dark, earthy essence of this Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc trio.",50.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
91462,Conn Valley 1997 Eloge Red (Napa Valley),"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.",80.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
91463,Cain 1997 Concept Red (Napa Valley),"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",42.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
91466,Chimney Rock 1997 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),"The bouquet offers intensely jammy prune and black-currant fruit, with tobacco and vanilla shadings making an appearance. Dark blueberry flavors, with some mint and a light orange-citrus note. Full grapey mouthfeel, a long finish, and dusty tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002 and until 2010.",52.0,89,8,0.9851487050465235
92159,Audubon Cellars 1997 Picnic Hill Vineyard Late Harvest Zinfandel (Amador County),"Exaggerated, burnt aromas of sun-dried tomato, raisins and plum liqueur don’t roll out the red carpet. Sweet (5.35% RS) and fruity, but also tannic and on the rough, earthy side. Ultimately it finishes short.",14.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
92160,Korbel 1997 Master's Reserve Blanc de Noir  (Russian River Valley),"This beery bubbly, with its flinty fruit and mouth-puckering acidity, is fine for parties or using as a mixer. It definitely sparkles. But it’s not Champagne, no matter what Korbel chooses to call it.",14.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
94324,Fetzer 1997 Home Ranch Zinfandel (California),"Ripe, briary aromas of wild berries, plums and earth veer into dark chocolate. Flavors are on the light side, and seem a little soft. An affordable everyday wine to serve at picnics. Don’t be misled by the “Home Ranch” description; this is not an estate wine.",9.0,82,8,0.9851487050465235
94329,Io 1997 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier. Opens with brilliant, beautiful aromas of berries and fruit, chocolate, violets, herbs and spices, and smoky oak. In the mouth, there's fabulous complexity and an opulent, velvety smooth texture. Very dry and elegant, and the sweet, spicy finish goes on forever.",40.0,94,8,0.9851487050465235
94331,Glen Fiona 1997 Basket Press Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rhône-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.",55.0,93,8,0.9851487050465235
94335,Hedges 1997 Red Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one-third Merlot blend, this is the winery’s prestige cuvée. Lushly perfumed with blueberry, black cherry and red fruits, it’s high-toned and assertive. A serious effort that is still tight as a drum, tannic and deeply streaked with black spices, smoke, tar and coffee.",45.0,92,8,0.9851487050465235
95660,Palmer 1997 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Strays too far into the kitchen-herb spectrum for this taster. Big and creamy, with a mocha finish that lingers, but the fresh-cut thyme, parsley and basil make for an eccentric mouthful.",18.0,83,8,0.9851487050465235
99436,Martin & Weyrich 1997 Ueberroth Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish.",22.0,87,8,0.9851487050465235
99451,Windsor 1997 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Firm, fruity, with tropical flavors and lots of alcohol. The flavors are tight and contained, the fruit tends to strawberry, and the finish is tannic.",18.0,86,8,0.9851487050465235
99455,Meeker 1997 Eighth Rack Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Forward, fruity and clean, with a jokey label showing a moose, an elk and a sheep playing pool. This wine would make a great house Zin if the price were just a tad lower.",14.0,86,8,0.9851487050465235
99571,Cedar Mountain 1997 One Oak Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley),"Held back for five years, but it hasn't done the wine much good. Earthy, with funky aromas. The flavors aren't bad, veering toward blackberries, but it's still pretty tannic.",21.0,84,8,0.9851487050465235
30372,Rex Hill 1993  Oregon,"There’s some funkiness in the nose from a healthy dose of sulfur, but once it blows off it uncovers a firm, dry, slightly toasty wine with good structure and balance. Some bitterness in the finish (perhaps attributable to that same SO2) is the only off note.",24.0,86,8,0.9851335269383661
66101,Schramsberg 1993 J. Schram  (Napa Valley),"An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.",65.0,93,8,0.9851335269383661
5443,Gloria Ferrer 1992 Royal Cuvee Brut  (Carneros),"Marked by strong, bright citrus and vanilla aromas, and a waft of freshly kneaded bread dough and toast, this charming wine has limeade flavors with a toasty finish. It’s dry and has class and refinement.",22.0,88,8,0.9840333165238485
16827,Iron Horse 1992 Blanc de Blancs  (Sonoma County),"This lovely wine has classic green-apple and lime aromas that are fully developed, with a nice backdrop of yeast and dough. In the mouth, it’s very rich. At eight years, the acids and tannins have modulated, leaving behind a creamy texture. And yet it’s still young and will age.",34.0,92,8,0.9840333165238485
16836,Pacific Echo 1992 Private Reserve Brut  (Anderson Valley),"A very fun and pure-pleasure rendering of California sparkling wine. From some of the best grapes in Mendocino County, Pacific Echo has hit a home run. Delicious pear and apple fruit unfolds in sweet, nutty form. It’s creamy yet crisp in the mouth, and thirst-quenching—a nice bonus. Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.",32.0,91,8,0.9840333165238485
4260,Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.",18.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
4262,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",20.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
4268,Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",25.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
4270,Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",18.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
4279,Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",18.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
4280,Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",16.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
4282,Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",15.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
7014,Peirano 1998 Shiraz (Lodi),"This pretty wine shows how well this variety thrives in Lodi. There's a mushu pork note, with peppery plum aromas and flavors that are delicious, and yet the wine is bone dry. Adequate acids and tannins make for balance. It may not be a complex wine but it's a thoroughly enjoyable one. Best Buy.",10.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
9926,Buffalo Ridge 1998 French Camp Zinfandel (Central Coast),"Simple fruit and a sweet, almost candied flavor. This wine seems unbalanced. There's an odd hole in the middle, and very little weight or tannin in the finish. It's all forward, sweet fruit, more like candy than berries.",12.0,82,8,0.9830952708870905
9931,Wagner 1998 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),"The more I taste Vidal, the more I find it an acquired taste—a taste I've yet to acquire. This one has intense aromas of canned creamed corn, with a few other vegetal hints thrown in for good measure. Yes, it's sweet, with balancing acidity and a rich, lush mouthfeel, but the flavors—well, let's just say they're unique.",18.0,81,8,0.9830952708870905
9936,Dolce 1998 White (Napa Valley),"Ripe hay, vanilla, and apricot mark the nose; deep orange flavors with cinnamon spice notes and a very smooth mouthfeel are the already promising attributes of this infant. All the right elements are there, and in good balance. Best cellared for three to five years.",75.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
9950,Etude 1998 Pinot Blanc (Carneros),"Starts off with rich, fragrant aromas of ripe peaches, mangos and flowers, with vanilla and buttery-oaky notes. There's lots of buttercream in the mouth, along with ripe, forward tropical fruit and spice flavors and a high acidity level that creates a searing, mouthwatering quality. Good stuff.",25.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10973,Edmeades 1998 Ciapusci Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"Head-trained, century-old vines, provide intense scents with old vine herbal, herbaceous accents. Watermelon, hay and strawberries, intensely extracted and 17.5% alcohol. This is over-the-top winemaking, with powerful old vine fruit, and a big, extracted finish, with lingering toasty, hazelnut and vanilla highlights.",25.0,92,8,0.9830952708870905
10974,Edmeades 1998 Eagle Point Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino),"There's 19% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah blended in, making for a succulent wine, with spicy, lively fruit leading the charge. There's enough acid to give it structure and balance, but not so much that the wine seems edgy or sour. Full bodied, mouthfilling, flavorful and distinctive.",24.0,92,8,0.9830952708870905
10975,Ridge 1998 Lytton Springs Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish.

10977,Steele 1998 Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel (Clear Lake),"Soft, rich fruit, with layers of plum, cherry, berry and accents of toast and vanilla.

10978,Murphy-Goode 1998 Liar's Dice Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Toasty nose, bright fruit, makes for a classy, creamy, zippy Zin. This is really a pleasure, balanced and forward and full of life. There are some nuances of tar and spice in a balanced, exceptionally lively, seductive wine.",17.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10980,St. Francis 1998 Pagani Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Extracted, tannic, dark and dense, with briary, jammy fruit and thick tannins. Blackberries and chocolate, set off with lots of acid. It's a sensational, balanced, bold, ageworthy Zin.",40.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10982,St. Francis 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo.",25.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10983,Seghesio 1998 San Lorenzo Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead.",28.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10984,Collier Falls 1998 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Well-made, with clean, bright fruit and lots of pretty new oak. The wine is beautifully balanced, elegant with a long, rich, toasty finish. Fairly light fruit in this vintage, but well handled and perfectly showcased.",21.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10985,Rosenblum 1998 Alegria Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.",26.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
10987,Midnight 1998 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Good color, tight, firm fruit, with some heft to it. There's cassis as well as cherry, and the wine has the weight of a Sonoma Zin, with good acids to give it lift. This is the first estate bottling from this exciting new winery. Unfortunately, just 28 cases made.",21.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905

10991,Villa Mt. Eden 1998 Monte Rosso Vineyard Grand Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Ripe, round, toasty wine, with rich, plummy fruit and a full-throttle palate feel.

10993,Ridge 1998 Geyserville Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead.",30.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
10994,Rosenblum 1998 Hendry Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Full bodied and well-oaked, this full-throttle Zin comes on with intense blackberry and vanilla aromas and flavors accented by cinnamon and chocolate notes.

12107,Mirassou 1998 Harvest Reserve Merlot (Monterey County),"Simple and cola-like, it has bright flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, with peppery, alcoholic heat, although it's basically dry. The weight is more like a rosé than a red, but it's pure and tasty.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15055,Ledson 1998 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"This is one of the most interesting Merlots of the vintage because it combines fruity ripeness with herbal and vegetal notes to create a complex wine. Blackberry and cassis, a bit of stewed tomato and mushroom, grilled meat, green olives and roasted coffee beans only begin to describe it. Dry and harmonious.",34.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
15937,Grgich Hills 1998 Zinfandel (California),"Somewhat closed, the nose of this offering shows some red berry, currants and anise. An evenly textures palate, more of the fruits evidenced on the nose with slight pepperiness mark a classic Zinfandel profile. The finish is moderately tannic, and the wine has the potential to evolve for a year or two.",23.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
15939,Kenwood 1998 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.",20.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
15942,Peachy Canyon 1998 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This wine, from a newly acquired property, is tart and young, grapy almost, with the fruit a little reduced. The wine seems to be in hiding. It falls off in the middle and finishes with tannin and little else. This may just need more time in bottle to blossom.",26.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
15943,Seghesio 1998 Cortina Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins.",26.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
15945,La Crema 1998 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Smooth style, with lots of vanilla cream and ripe berry fruit. Forward, inviting style of wine, with light tannins and a clean, focused finish. It's well balanced and professionally made, but ultimately unexciting.",19.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
15949,Norman 1998 Monster Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Smells very ripe, almost stewed, and it lives up to its name (The Monster) with big, rustic, extracted, alcoholic flavors. For those who like old-style Zin, with no-holds-barred power.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905

15951,Brutocao 1998 Brutocao Vineyards Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Cranberries and watermelon in the nose, leading into a soft, light, pleasant wine. Smooth and simple flavors; the wine needs to be chilled to show its best. This is made for near-term enjoyment.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15952,Rodney Strong 1998 Knotty Vines Zinfandel (Northern Sonoma),"This lavishly oaked, opaque Zinfandel sports a dense nose of blackberry with pronounced toasty and menthol shadings. The mouthfeel is full and smooth, there's dark fruit and plenty of espresso, bitter chocolate and tar on the palate and finish, with tannins to lose on the back end. The wine may open up and the fruit ascend more in a year; lovers of heavy toast can eagerly drink it up now.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15953,Venus 1998 Cervina Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is the first wine from this new winery. Clean, light berry fruit is the whole show, and it's a forward, fruity Zin with friendly, simple flavors.",22.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15954,Vigil 1998 Marissa Vineyard Zinfandel (California),"This gets the award for the most confusing label of the month. It says Vigil “Tradicion” and also names the vineyard, then writes Mokelumne River Old Vines, and finishes with Lodi. Talk about information overload! Bottom line: it's a fruity, oaky, simple and straightforward bottle of Zin. 'Nuff said.",16.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15956,Sobon Estate 1998 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Firm, fruity wine, with good clean varietal flavors. Simple and ripe, with a big, tannic finish.",15.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15960,Sobon Estate 1998 Zinfandel (Fiddletown),"Alcoholic, volatile nose, with some pickley edges to it. The wine is smooth and fruity, with a quick, hot, alcoholic finish and very dry tannins.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15962,Kenwood 1998 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Full berry cocoa and pepper aromas on the nose open to solid black cherry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is big, but there's fairly high acidity, too, and some big tannins with a decided bite on the back end.  The elements are there in this dense and chunky wine; only time will tell if they come into greater harmony.",15.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15963,Mayo 1998 Ricci Vyd Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"The nose of this Russian River Valley, single-vineyard offering shows positive dark berry fruit bearing mild meaty accents.  Made in a lighter style, the flavors follow the aromatic opening and the wine finishes dry with medium tannins, red berry and tea notes.",25.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15964,Stone Creek 1998 Special Selection Zinfandel (California),"Lithe and nicely balanced, this flavorful wine shows a red berry-herb bouquet and a pleasingly dry, gently spicy palate. The mouthfeel is good, and shows some texture despite the fact that it's light-weight on the palate. An interesting chalk note comes in on the back end of this pleasant, easy-drinking surprise.",8.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
15965,Talus 1998 Zinfandel (California),"Plenty of herbal, mushroomy notes in the nose. The wine is light, soft and fruity. The mushroom flavors could be a real asset with the right food. Finishes true to form, with nothing off.",8.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
17115,Verité 1998 La Joie Red (Sonoma County),"Firmly tannic and rather mouth-numbing even at five years of age. Enters with a hard edge and finishes tough and gritty. Will it age? There are some black cherry flavors inside, but it's a gamble.",100.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
17116,Icaria Creek 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon-Barbera (Alexander Valley),"One of the last ‘98s to be released, and still dark in color. The tannins are hefty, although they're of the soft, pliant kind, and acidity is low. Oak overshadows the fruit. Not offering much now, and doesn't seem to be an ager.",45.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
17119,Kiona 1998 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A ripe, almost thick, peach-laden wine with big, rich fruit and lots of punch.",6.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
24644,Lolonis 1998 Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"Sweet, spicy fruit, with nicely matched toasty oak framing it. Everything balances out; this actually has the best balance and most seductive fruit of the three Lolonis bottlings, and certainly represents the best value.",20.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
24645,Rosenblum 1998 St. Peter's Church Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.",40.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
24649,Consilience 1998 Rhodes Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse. Flavorful, smooth and not weighty, it has a pleasing, even texture on the tongue and displays good persistence with berry, pepper and dark toast flavors lingering on the back end. Perhaps over-oaked, but suavely so.",27.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
24656,Robert Craig 1998 Zinfandel (Amador County),"The blackberry fruit is wrapped in very deeply toasted oak. Aromas and flavors of cassis, vanilla, coffee and licorice mingle to display a dark flavor profile but positive tart-sweetness. Full and even on the tongue, this black beauty finishes with lingering spice and espresso notes.",24.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
24657,Wildhurst 1998 Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel (Clear Lake),"Spicy, ripe fruit, with an edge to it. Well-defined wine, which shows briar, toast, berry and coffee flavors sprinkled throughout. Well-built, sturdy, a little hot, but balanced and long.",14.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
24667,Rosenblum 1998 Rustridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel. The somewhat candied quality to the berry fruit was not favored by all tasters, but the plush yet structured mouthfeel has significant appeal. Dark sweet-tart fruit and moderate, even tannins work together to provide a positive finish.",18.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
24668,Newlan 1998 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Good, thick, black cherry fruit, dense tannins, with a dark, dense, chalky finish. This is manly Zin—muscular, balanced and heavy. Great for outdoor grilling.",22.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
24669,Savannah-Chanelle 1998 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is bright and smooth, with forward berry fruit and just the right amount of chocolaty oak. Supple and tangy, with a lip-smacking finish.",22.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
24670,Seghesio 1998 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.",18.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
24671,Shenandoah 1998 Special Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),"High toned, alcoholic nose, with cherry nail-polish scents. Cherries and plums fill the mouth, along with tongue-lashing tannins. The blend includes 6% Grenache and 4% Mourvèdre, which gives it a nice, peppery edge. Lots of flavor for this price.",10.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
27921,Lieb 1998 Pinot Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Creamy, spicy aromas show hints of oranges or tangerines. Medium-weight, with a clean finish that would complement virtually any seafood dish.",15.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
30380,Dry Creek Vineyard 1998 Heritage Clone Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Not from old vines, but cloned from them in the pursuit of complexity. This is a very young, backward Zin, dominated by dusty, earthy notes, like a whiff of south-facing barnboard under a hot summer sun. There are some fruity, spicy flavors, but the flavors are similarly closed, and moderate tannins and high acidity produce a scouring texture. Might be more user-friendly with a few years of aging.",15.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
30383,Montevina 1998 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"This is pretty good Zin, fully ripened and showing classic wild berry and spice notes, although there’s an earthy, cardboardy aroma that’s a little off-putting. The tannins are very soft, and the acidity is a bit low, making it simple and one-dimensional. Still, not a bad deal at this price.",10.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
33850,Quilceda Creek 1998 Merlot (Washington),"This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet.",60.0,92,8,0.9830952708870905
33853,Lambert Bridge 1998 Crane Creek Cuvee Red (Dry Creek Valley),"A really wonderful wine. It seems classic Dry Creek Valley, in terms of bright, spicy fruit, as polished as marble on the surface, with maybe less stuffing than, say, Napa. But that's not to put it down. Racy tannins and dry acids make it competitive in a worldwide market.",50.0,92,8,0.9830952708870905
35691,Hargrave 1998 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors. There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.,18.0,82,8,0.9830952708870905

35708,Claudia Springs 1998 Rhodes Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"A juicy, jammy, alcoholic style, tannic and young. This is gutsy, high-toned wine, with fat, extracted fruit. Very dry tannins, good balance. This wine needs time; it's a very different style from the other Claudia Springs Zins. But it shows the same attention to detail, intense fruit, and stylish, sensitive winemaking.",24.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
35709,Cline 1998 Live Oak Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.",28.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
35711,Claudia Springs 1998 Eagle Point Ranch Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Zin with a Pinot sensibility; it's bright, spicy and forward. Sweet, delicious fruit, with accents of cinnamon, cardamom and anise. This is an elegant and subtle wine, but unusually long and complex, with wonderful structure. Enticing, enchanting wine.",20.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
35712,Cline 1998 Big Break Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"A blast of spice, mint, bramble and pepper explodes from the glass. The wine is dense, dark, deep and mysterious; the flavors pungent, penetrating and persistent. Tannic, layered with herbs and spices, powered with big, punchy fruit. This is classic Cline.",28.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
39326,Apex 1998 Kestrel Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This tangy wine is laced with plenty of toasty new oak, giving it scents and flavors of cocoa and spice. Some excellent fruit is there, tasting of tart black cherries, but it seems a bit overwhelmed. —P.G.",60.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
39338,Markham 1998 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Markham has been a reliable Petite source over the years, and succeeded even in the difficult '98 vintage. Rich blackberries and blueberries are dusted with black pepper. The one indication of a tough year is the dry, tannic finish, but it should work fine with a rare steak. —J.C.",24.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
44349,Philip Staley 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From this Rhône specialist, a nice sipping wine with powerfully fruity flavors in a delicately structured, light-bodied wine. The pretty wild-berry and oregano flavors are surrounded by velvety tannins and soft acidity, so it goes down like silk. It's dry as dust.",18.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
44401,Canoe Ridge 1998 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Clear, bright and fragrant, with a soft and seductive nose. This is a wine that can only be called pretty, with a light floral component to it—roses maybe. There’s lots of ripe black-cherry fruit, some raspberries, and a chocolaty edge. It’s made for drinking right away, but structured enough for near-term aging.",25.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
44408,Kiona 1998 Late Harvest White Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Delicate, elegant and floral, with light flavors of white peaches and citrus blossom carrying over to a lingering, nicely knit, stylish and elegant finish. Just 10% alcohol. Best Buy.",7.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
44412,Robert Mondavi 1998 To-Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"This wine, from the man who invented the name ""Fumé Blanc,"" is not for everyone. It's way on the citrus, hay, and gooseberry side of the chart (as it is in every vintage), making for a lean, tart, almost sharp drink that some will find sour despite softening with 6% Sémillon and lees aging. Others will appreciate the sleek, almost severe elegance. Again, a wine that absolutely demands the right foods.",28.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
44414,Buttonwood Farm 1998 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"Here's a ripe, complex white wine with aromas and flavors ranging from tangerines, apricots and bananas to malted chocolate milk. It tastes very ripe and fruity, with a soft, creamy mouthfeel like peach syrup. There might be just a tad of residual sugar in there, but it's basically a dry wine.",12.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
44415,Thurston Wolfe 1998 Burgess Vineyard Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 80% Zinfandel and 20% Petite Sirah. The nose is forward, with rich, ripe scents of plummy fruit and zingy spice. This is a lively, tart, zippy wine with attractive flavors. The fruit mingles plums, apples and berries; it's distinctive-very spicy and fairly lightweight, but still quite flavorful.",20.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
44420,Canoe Ridge 1998 Red Table Wine Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 79% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is clear and bright, with sweet blueberry and cherry fruit and a pleasant whiff of barnyard. Very soft tannins and acids make for an easy-drinking red wine that would make a terrific house pour.",14.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
45508,Rodney Strong 1998 Estate Vineyards Merlot (Alexander Valley),"At four-plus years, the tannins are resolved, although far from absent. Acidity is also high. Finally the wine is coming around, with spicy plum and cassis flavors, but it is teetering on the verge of old age already, and has an edge of senility.",26.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
52431,J Vineyards & Winery 1998 Late Disgorged Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"This complex sparkling wine was held back on the lees in the bottle for nearly a decade, which is the meaning of late disgorged. Tasted beside J's 2000 Vintage Brut, it's not as immediately luscious or delicate, having a more scoury edge, although the flavors are similar. The impression is one of ageability. Try holding until after 2010.",115.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
52451,Gloria Ferrer 1998 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"A luscious and superior California bubbly, this blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay shows an irresistable richness of raspberry purée, cherry skin bitterness, vanilla, yeasty baked bread and something unidentifiably smoky-sweet. Yet it's bone dry. With a long, complex finish, it should continue to age beyond this, its tenth birthday.",50.0,93,8,0.9830952708870905
58412,Midnight 1998 Mare Nectaris Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"With 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, you might expect this five-varietal Bordeaux blend to taste pretty much like Cabernet, and it does. Although there's plenty of toasty, cedary oak, the cassis fruit shines through, dressed up by vanilla and chocolate notes. Not as deep as in the best of vintages, but a classy crowd-pleaser nonetheless.",34.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
60247,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Late Harvest Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"Opens with immense, luscious aromas of apricot liqueur, vanilla custard, fennel, orange blossom and honeysuckle. Explodes on the palate with enormous fruit and spice flavors; it’s intense and concentrated. Very sweet, but the acidity is high and cleansing. It has a velvety texture, and finishes long and sweet. Enjoy it with vanilla ice cream or crème brûlée",20.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
60649,Clos du Val 1998 Palisade Vineyard Zinfandel (Stags Leap District),"From an estate vineyard on the Silverado Trail, an exuberantly ripe, jammy Zin with enough fruit to launch the space shuttle. Raspberry and cherry dominate, with tannins as soft as silk. In fact, there’s something almost Beaujolais-like about this likable wine, except that the intense spices are a dead giveaway.",25.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
60656,Dry Creek Vineyard 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"From primo Zin country comes this pretty red wine. Starts out with jammy, youthful aromas of wild berries and turns soft and fruity in the mouth. Although the flavors are nice, it’s a bit watery, although the spicy finish will leave your palate tingling.",19.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
60807,Dry Creek Vineyard 1998 Meritage Red (Sonoma County),"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",28.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
60817,Green & Red 1998 Chiles Mill Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity. Partial whole-berry fermentation brings an element of spicy, forward fruitiness to the wine. Lively mouthfeel, with some heat and lift to the finish. If there were more depth and punch to the fruit, this would warrant an even higher rating.",22.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
60820,Babcock 1998 Fathom Red (Santa Barbara County),"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast.",30.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
60821,Ventana 1998 Merlot (Monterey),"You don't get sun-ripened Merlot from Monterey the way you do from warmer inland valleys, but this charming wine might surprise you. Yes, it's on the earthy side, with hints of sweeter black cherries and some smoky oak, but it's so well balanced, that it's really delightful. It's also very dry, with manageable tannins.",16.0,89,8,0.9830952708870905
60829,Stonegate 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Not bad for this vintage, which has ended up thinner than originally thought. The grapes had to struggle to ripen, and you can taste the tension between greenness and sweetness. Quite a bit of oak adds charred, smoky, vanilla notes and a glyceriny sweetness. This is elegant stuff; not a big wine, but it is very well made and its pedigree is obvious.",22.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
62651,Columbia Winery 1998 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),"Light and grapefruity, without much Pinot Gris character. An innocuous, fairly generic white wine.",9.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
62653,Forest Glen 1998 Merlot (California),"Has aromas of blackberries and plums, with an earthy note, and a medicinal streak. Flavors are fruity and it drinks dry, with an earthy roughness that time won't round out. Simple and pleasant.",10.0,83,8,0.9830952708870905
62654,Hoodsport 1998 Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"Has dense, heavy aromas of jasmine, cinnamon, rose petal, chocolate and citrus. Fruity and fairly sweet, with flavors of ripe peaches, nectarines and orange sherbet. Acidity is okay, but there's a heaviness, a thickness to the wine that makes it a bit awkward on the palate.",9.0,83,8,0.9830952708870905

62658,R.H. Phillips 1998 Merlot (Dunnigan Hills),"A simple, everyday red that won't break the bank. The grapes tend to get a little baked this far inland, especially Merlot, which really needs just the right conditions to maintain delicacy and balance. As a result the dominant notes are earthy, with a slightly baked or raisiny quality. The tannins, needless to say, are soft, and the acidity is low.",9.0,82,8,0.9830952708870905
62660,Hoodsport 1998 Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"The aromas are watery and very faint, suggestive of kiwi, lime and vanilla. Flavors are similarly very light. What the palate gives is alcohol, acidity and sugar, with just the barest trace of citrus.",9.0,81,8,0.9830952708870905
62662,Hoodsport 1998 Sémillon (Yakima Valley),"Has indistinct watery aromas of lemons and buttercups. Fresh and clean, but the flavors are weak and washed out. There's adequate acidity and alcohol, but your palate really has to work to ferret out the lemony flavors.",9.0,81,8,0.9830952708870905
66109,Navarro 1998 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Odd as it may sound, it smells like coconut cream pie with a baked meringue topping, all swimming in apricot purée. It’s sweet but not achingly so, at 7.1% residual sugar, with enough acidity to balance it. It has a luscious, creamy mouthfeel. It seems young and tight despite the opulence; probably it will improve with age in a cool cellar. Best Buy.",12.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
67865,Sebastiani 1998 Madrone Ranch Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Only 1,100 cases of this lovely liquid, but you'll swear you're drinking Pomerol. The fruity profile is strong, mellowed by oak influences and designer tannins. A dry limpidity and softness to the structure makes you appreciate it all the more. Twenty-four percent Cabernet Sauvignon adds curranty complexities.",40.0,91,8,0.9830952708870905
67866,Benziger 1998 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Opens with a burst of blackberry, mint, game and smoky oak, and turns rich and flavorful in the mouth, with enormous concentration and depth of flavor.

67876,Valley of the Moon 1998 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Sangiovese still isn't a major varietal in California but wines like this push it a notch in that direction. You'll like the pretty berry flavors, integrity of tannins and acidity and rich, dry finish. It's a terrific food wine. You might find yourself reaching for a third glass of this pretty wine over that luxury Cabernet.",16.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
75210,Philip Staley 1998 Mourvèdre (Russian River Valley),"Sprightly and light, this is a feathery wine on the palate, with soft acids and gentle tannins, although the fruit is pure California. Raspberry, tobacco, blackberry and cinnamon flavors fill the mouth and are delicious to savor. It's very dry and stylish, with a fruity, Lifesaver finish.",16.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
77517,Paschal 1998 Syrah-Cabernet (Oregon),"Yes, that is the official name for this tannic blend. It features tart berry fruit; a bit Zin-like; the tannins are substantial but well managed, without the chalkiness often found in southern Oregon. A good summer BBQ wine.",24.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
77526,Valley View 1998 Anna Maria Merlot (Oregon),"This is a light and leafy effort, whose soft and forward fruit mixes flavors of leaf, beet, tomato and red fruits. It is balanced but insubstantial.",18.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
77843,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"A pleasing blend of black cherry, chocolate and herb flavors, all couched in powdery tannins that should smooth out nicely in the cellar. This moderate-bodied Merlot is good for drinking now, too. Finishes clean.",35.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
77849,St. Supéry 1998 Red Meritage (Napa Valley),"Juicy blackberry aromas are spiced up by dried-herb, black-pepper and vanilla-bean notes. On the palate, dark berries and toast are accented by earth and green tobacco, and chewy, gritty tannins. Taut red fruit rolled in white and black pepper sums it up. 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot.",50.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
77850,Sebastiani 1998 Merlot (Sonoma County),"From volcanic red soil, a deeply fruity wine. Even in this vintage they managed to wring some fine blackberry and cassis flavors from the grapes. Wrapped in rich, mellow tannins and backed by soft acidity, the wine spreads across the palate carrying waves of flavors.",22.0,88,8,0.9830952708870905
78860,Dry Creek Vineyard 1998 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",21.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
78862,Newlan 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley),"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",20.0,85,8,0.9830952708870905
78865,Compass 1998 Merlot (California),"Starts out with Cabernet-like aromas of black currants and an undercurrent of something leaner: unsweetened chocolate, anise, and smoky, oaky notes.  This wine accomplishes what many inexpensive Merlots don't: a rich, fruity smoothness.  Which makes it a good Merlot value, even though the score isn't very high.",10.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
80218,Buttonwood Farm 1998 Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Fruity and accessible, it combines wild berry notes with earthy, herbal ones and a meaty, leathery streak. It's dry, with negotiable tannins. Turns sharp and a little green on the finish. —S.H.",18.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
80307,Kenwood 1998 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Enough berry and plum richness and smoky oak to satisfy fussy drinkers, yet dry and compact, with a nice shine of acidity.

84021,Glen Ellen 1998 Reserve White Zinfandel (California),"A coppery colored, off-dry-to-frankly-sweet wine that's simple, fruity and a little cloying. The dominant flavors are peaches and strawberries, with a very spicy finish, but the acidity seems a bit low. Still, at this price, millions of people will find a lot to like.",7.0,83,8,0.9830952708870905
84038,Callaway 1998 Coastal Merlot (California),"A light, earthy wine, with violet, berry and tea flavors and a sharp, herbal note verging on grassiness or wet hay. It's very dry and the tannins are soft, but crisp acidity keeps it lively in the mouth.",10.0,82,8,0.9830952708870905
86520,Sonora 1998 Story Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"A dense purple color, with jammy, grapy fruit. Plenty of extraction, yielding a grapy, fruity wine with a little bit of fizz to it. The wine promises more depth than it delivers; the finish falls off quickly and feels flat.",21.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
86521,Foppiano 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Gamy flavors distinguish this wine, giving it a Rhônish flair. There's a good, meaty mouthfeel, red berries and cherries, with lots of tang. The finish falls off quickly though, making for a fairly light impression overall.",15.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
86523,Lake Sonoma 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Blackberry aromas with tobacco accents turn slightly barnyardy. Brisk acidity supports the solid, spicy red and black berry fruit here, but the palate feel is rather thin. It's fairly full-scaled, but not particularly graceful, and finishes dry and burnt-toasty, with a briar and tobacco note.",15.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
86526,Saviez 1998 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Beaucoup d'oak. Delicious, toasty, roasty, mocha-flavored oak. But the fruit is missing in action. The color suggests that there is some light, plummy fruit underlying all the oak, but it's hiding.",28.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905
86530,Sonora 1998 TC Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"Dark and deep purple/black, with a Port-like nose. There's a little fizz on the palate, which seems odd in a wine this big, and the flavors are locked in tight. Flat, dry, tannic finish.",21.0,84,8,0.9830952708870905

86533,Perry Creek 1998 Zin Man Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"A peppery nose, tart wine, with plenty of acid, perhaps too much acid. The mouthfeel is awkward, unbalanced, and the finish is odd. It tastes over-manipulated.",12.0,83,8,0.9830952708870905

88381,Geyser Peak 1998 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Dry Creek Valley),"Even before you smell it, you can tell this is a sweetie from the old-gold color and thick texture. Aromas of vanilla custard and crème brûlée, apricot preserves, orange-blossom honey and vanilla. Flavors are extravagantly fruity and sweet, with a honeyed aftertaste that lingers. It could use a bit more acidity to balance out all that sugar.",19.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
88768,Everett Ridge 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Very pretty nose, with plenty of raspberry-focused fruit, and a nice creamy mouthfeel.

88771,Limerick Lane 1998 Collins Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"All the components of fine Zinfandel are in top form here, from the opening fat, dark berry aromas to the deep, sweet fruit on the smoothly textured palate and the lovely fruit-acid balance.

88777,Edmeades 1998 Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"More of that mountain intensity, with very ripe fruit buttressed with spicy, mineral elements. Brambly, briary, and spicy, leading into a fleshy, round, ripe, soft middle and a long, fruity finish. Good right now.",25.0,90,8,0.9830952708870905
88778,Alderbrook 1998 OVOC Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Delicious berries and cream nose, which follows through with crisp, spicy flavors and good structure.

A green note does show early and persists, but the wine still has very good feel, and the silky finish displays a long pepper and red berry fade.",26.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99430,Wagner 1998 Ice Wine Vignoles (Finger Lakes),"Shows off the exotic musky-spicy side of this grape in its peppery, leathery aromas. Turns tropical in the mouth: papaya and mango are joined by zippy citrus-tinged acidity. Finishes long, with some of the peppery notes returning.",18.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99432,Cartlidge & Browne 1998 Zinfandel (California),"Tight as a drum, but a little cherry fruit escapes from the nose. It opens up into a sweet, lovely bottle of wine, with a bit of cocoa and coffee in the finish. Well-balanced, with sweet, clean fruit.",10.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99438,Peterson 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's a lively gaminess to the nose; a wild, Rhônish note, perhaps from the Carignane, Mourvèdre and Petit Sirah blended in. This wine is front-loaded: the flavors lighten up on the palate, and the finish is tight and tannic.",18.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99439,Shooting Star 1998 Zinfandel (Lake County),"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit. Unlike a lot of lower cost Zins, this wine has a lot of sweet fruit, and enough body and weight to carry through past the nose into a big, satisfying finish. Nice toast, plenty of acid, a bit hot in the finish.",12.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99444,Folie à Deux 1998 La Grande Folie Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"A fair amount of the cuvee is from the 130-year-old Grandpère vineyard, which lends a soft, herbal, grassy undertone to the wine. From elsewhere comes bright cherry fruit, and the wine seems a little disjointed, though it may come together in time. Some nail polish in the nose carries through to the finish.",44.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99445,Per Sempre 1998 Wirth Ranch Vineyard Zinfandel (Solano County),"This attractive wine opens with a nicely nuanced bouquet of berry, spice and earth accented by positive gamy and slightly barnyardy notes. The textured palate offers attractive dark fruit and a touch of tar and licorice. Ends with an even, dry, long finish of pepper, earth and leather.",30.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99446,Sebastiani 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",22.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99447,Lolonis 1998 Tollini Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"A lot of wood, still pretty rough, surrounds a thick, tannic, muscular, ripe, rustic, Old World-style Zin. There's nothing elegant about this wine, but it packs a lot of flavor into a sturdy frame.",28.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99449,Rocking Horse 1998 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Red berry, rhubarb, herb and smoke aromas show in this lighter, claret-styled Zin. Good acidity supports its tart cherry flavors, and the herb note in the bouquet reprises on the finish, accompanied by an attractive pepperiness. Balanced and attractive, it will pair well with many foods.",18.0,87,8,0.9830952708870905
99457,Edmeades 1998 Zeni Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"Tannic, alcoholic nose, with a softer, rosier color tending toward brick. Old vines, soft, sweet, ancient flavors. The wine feels a little bit pushed — the alcohol is too high, and the finish is harsh, tannic and hot.",30.0,86,8,0.9830952708870905
114404,Kynsi 1998 South Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"From a warm vineyard, it has super-ripe aromas of baked cherry pie, with smoky vanilla. Made in a rustic style, with berry flavors and soft acidity.",25.0,83,8,0.9830952708870905
16822,Iron Horse 1991 Brut L.D.  (Sonoma County),"One whiff tells you this bubbly is in a league of its own. It’s not the toast or the lees, not the lime-scented fruit or the doughy notes; it’s something indefinable, but complex and refined. That pedigree carries through in the mouth, where the fruit is modulated. The impression is of acidity and elegance, although the fruit shows up in the finish. Terrific now, but has the balance and harmony to last for a lot longer.",60.0,93,8,0.9827215059104499
47895,Gloria Ferrer 1991 Carneros Cuvée Brut LD  (Carneros),"It’s a significant commitment of time, money and resources to cellar a sparkling wine for this long, and Ferrer is to be commended for going the extra mile. The wine rewards the years of producer patience with a soft richness that is both lush and creamy. The once-fresh bready scents have evolved into a toasty, nutty smoothness, and the flavors coat the palate and mellow through an extended finish.",32.0,90,8,0.9827215059104499
30370,Argyle 1989 Extended Tirage Brut  (Willamette Valley),"Ripe apples and toast on the nose of this Oregonian open to a medium-bodied wine with decent complexity and a soft foamy mousse. Crisp apple and herb flavors with a slight mineral note play out on the clean and tart finish, which displays good length.",30.0,86,8,0.9797096884977083
4258,Canoe Ridge 1999 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington),"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy.",12.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
4263,Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",23.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
4267,Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",19.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
4633,Cana's Feast 1999 Red (Red Mountain),"This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot is young, rambunctious and tight, but also very interesting. The aromas of chocolate, clove, pepper and black plum do the trick: you are drawn in. Intense flavors of cherry, plum, cassis and pepper, and a finish of piquant spices and oak are equally satisfying. Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.",30.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
6672,Imagery 1999 Sunny Slope Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar.",29.0,85,8,0.9795773347375224
7011,Columbia Crest 1999 Grand Estates Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G.",11.0,87,8,0.9795773347375224
7026,Columbia Winery 1999 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. —P.G.",15.0,87,8,0.9795773347375224
9948,Chalone Vineyard 1999 Pinot Blanc (Chalone),"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it.",24.0,91,8,0.9795773347375224
12108,Kunin 1999 French Camp Vineyards Syrah (Paso Robles),"Fresh young cherry-berry aromas, with a kiss of oak, lead to extracted, jammy, full-bodied flavors that explode in the mouth. Soft, luscious and round, there's lots of immediate pleasure here.",28.0,85,8,0.9795773347375224
12111,Mount Palomar 1999 Syrah (Temecula),"From this Southern California appellation, a spicy, rustic wine that's very dry and full of charm. Flavors of wild berries are strong and tannins are supple. It's not very varietal, but it's a nice, friendly wine.",16.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
12117,Stratford 1999 Syrah (California),"Plummy, smoky, chocolatey aromas lead to a richly flavored but slightly heavy wine. The soft, gentle tannins are easy to negotiate. There's a big wad of rich, jammy fruit that hits midpalate, while the finish is juicy and fruity.",18.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
12121,Paradise Ridge 1999 Ladi's Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness.",23.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
15051,"Terre Rouge 1999 Sentinel Oak Vineyard, Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))","Hang onto your hat; here's a very great Syrah. The aromas are hiding, now suggesting plum and blackberry, now black pepper, now freshly baked rhubarb pie. In the mouth, it knocks out with grace and power. It's soft as silk, but complex and layered, and the richly tannic finish suggests aging potential. Not too long, though.",35.0,94,8,0.9795773347375224
15053,Jaffurs 1999 Stolpman Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Incredibly rich, with ripe cherry, plum, spice and herb notes at the fore. It's all framed in luscious, broad tannins that are firm but velvety. Long on the finish.",32.0,93,8,0.9795773347375224
15056,Havens 1999 Hudson T Reserve Syrah (Napa Valley),"From a vineyard near Carneros, this inky, dark wine bursts with blackberry, clove and smoke aromas. Fantastic concentration of fruit; deep, plush and opulent. The depth of flavor is enormous, yet it's so supple and balanced. Very fine now. Try it with game.",45.0,93,8,0.9795773347375224
15057,Hartford 1999 Hartford Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"From the old vineyard in back of Don Hartford's house, this 15.7% alcohol Zin is big—but it's no brute. It's full of dark, rich blackberries, layered with chocolate and black pepper. The velvety texture carries through the long finish, picking up hints of black licorice. Editors' Choice.",34.0,93,8,0.9795773347375224
15058,Hartford 1999 Highwire Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Spicier than the other Hartford Zins, with the accent on black pepper and clove. Brambly blackberry and chocolate provide a solid foundation for spice complexities. Hints of crushed nettles provide yet another layer of flavor, and the wine finishes with zippy acids and peppery spice.",34.0,93,8,0.9795773347375224
15060,Terre Rouge 1999 Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"What an interesting wine. It drinks like it really comes from someplace, which is to say, it has terroir. It smells earthy and peppery, with a perfume of cassis. It's soft in tannins and acids, but utterly delicious. Hard to exaggerate the lip-smacking quality and fantastic finish.",22.0,93,8,0.9795773347375224
15061,Iron Horse 1999 T-bar-T Benchmark Red (Alexander Valley),"It's clear that winemaker Forrest Tancer is aiming at a California-class Cabernet blend, a complex wine, lush in fruit and herbs, softly tannic and framed in the finest oak. He largely succeeds with this bottling, made only in the best vintages. It lacks the structure of Napa Cabernet, which is unavoidable given its terroir. But it defines Alexander Valley.",56.0,92,8,0.9795773347375224
15063,Lambert Bridge 1999 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Seems very oaky, with in-your-face aromas of vanilla, char and pepper, but the fruit is able to support it. In fact, the underlying flavors are rich and gorgeous. It shows Cabernet's cassis and blackberry aromatics, with the soft tannins and velvety, drink-me-now texture of Merlot.",24.0,92,8,0.9795773347375224
17121,Hogue 1999 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hogue built its reputation with stunningly fruity, crisp, bright white wines such as this, and no one in America does a better fruit-forward Chenin. Delicious, like a New World Vouvray, with the same sweet/sour seduction and food-friendly acids. Best Buy.",7.0,87,8,0.9795773347375224
17123,Allora 1999 Cielo Red (Napa Valley),"This Super-Tuscan blend of Howell Mountain Sangiovese and Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is one dark wine. It smells big, too, like an egg cream, which New Yorkers will understand. This chocolatey wine has hints of malt, while the flavors are vast, suggesting ripe blackberries. It's a huge wine in extract and mouthfeel. This creates awkward food-pairing challenges. Barbecued ribs come to mind -- but at $45?",45.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
17125,Niebaum-Coppola 1999 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),"A wonderfully refined wine, with firm, ripe tannins that fream an elegant blend of rich plum, balckberry, coffee, chocolate, cassis, black cherry, cedar and spice flavors. The finish is long and smooth, with a bright cherry boost at the end. Francis Coppola's benchmark wine.",100.0,94,8,0.9795773347375224
20290,Weisinger's of Ashland 1999 Pompadour Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),"This is exceptionally dark, with a sappy, vinous nose showing black cherry, smoke, sweet chocolate, some stem and a hint of dill. There is more than a hint of pickle barrel, and lots of acid, chalky tannins",25.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
20298,Weisinger's of Ashland 1999 50% CH / 50% SEM Semillon-Chardonnay (Rogue Valley),"Some nice toasty flavors underscore generic fruit. When all is said and done, it is a neutral, crisp white wine enlivened with a bit of spice and toast from the barrel aging. Still, a bit of veggie/canned pea flavor dampens the finish.",15.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
20299,Wooldridge Creek 1999 Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Hints of spicy cranberry and white pepper suggest Syrah, but lack all of the grape's power. There is a fair amount of unripe leafiness as well.",16.0,84,8,0.9795773347375224
21697,Henry Estate 1999 Henry the V Red (Umpqua Valley),"You've got to love the name (there have been Henry II, III and IV's made, with different blends of grapes). This is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Franc, 9% Syrah and 5% Malbec. The nose shows earth and stem first, with some sweet grape and red fruits underneath. Balanced and fruit forward, with plenty of tart acids.",23.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21698,Girardet 1999 Marechal-Foch Red (Umpqua Valley),"This is a good, dark, iron-rich wine, with earth and mineral dominating through a tart finish. Interesting change of pace.",15.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21700,Abacela 1999 Vintners Blend Red Table Wine Red (Umpqua Valley),"The winery grows 17 different varietals, many in minute quantities. This is a blend of 8–12 different varietals, including such oddballs as Refosco and Freisa, along with Zin, Carignan, Tempranillo, some Cabs—in other words, it's a kitchen sink wine. Spicy and peppery, with firm acids under a forward mélange of red fruit flavors.",11.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21710,Beckmen 1999 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This seems to be losing its freshness and appears to be on the down side; the nose is a mixed bag of burnt toast, sulfur and dried straw. The palate offers more likable characteristics, such as green apple and citrus. But the finish is heavily wooded, and there's an element of cheese here.",20.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21716,Dundee Springs 1999 Pinot Blanc (Oregon),"Has a slight cheddar note from lees, riding over apple and lemon aromas. It drinks fruity and citrusy, and quite acidic, with a long, lemonade-flavored aftertaste. A clean, delightful wine.",16.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224

21719,Siskiyou Vineyards 1999 La Cave Blanche White (Oregon),"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon. The two are blended and fermented together in barrels, from a vineyard east of Medford. The wine has pleasant herbal, grassy notes, and some very tart fruit.",10.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21721,Valley View 1999 Anna Maria Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"The fruit shows pears, some high tones, some bitter rind. The style is fruit forward, with flavors of pears and citrus, leading to a light, toasty finish.",12.0,86,8,0.9795773347375224
21983,Steele 1999 Fumé Blanc (Lake County),"Buttered toast and baked bread aromas announce that this is a well-oaked SB. Apple, melon and lemon flavors all get support from powerful oak, while the finish is spicy, toasty, warm and full. This is a flavorful, full-bodied wine, but it is on the opposite end of the spectrum from lean.",16.0,88,8,0.9795773347375224
22863,Newlan 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),"An exciting and tastefully made wine that approaches the ultraripe fruit of the vintage with restraint. Young, jammy plum and blackberry flavors are reined in with herbal, olivey notes, and oak has been sparingly applied in this dry, elegant table wine.",20.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
22865,Charles Krug 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a really nice dinner wine, posh and elegant, yet with richly ripe flavors. Fully dry, with a complex balance of herbs and fruits, and wonderfully rich tannins. Obviously built for the table, a wine that won't distract from your favorite dishes.",21.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
22872,Jamieson Canyon 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Superripe and flamboyant, as you'd expect from the vintage, bursting with plum, blackberry, tobacco, sage and green olive flavors, and the tannins are a wonder. Velvety soft and luxurious in the mouth. A trace of acidic bitterness in the finish loses a few points.",17.0,90,8,0.9795773347375224
27557,Flora Springs 1999 Soliloquy Sauvignon Musqué (Napa Valley),"Fragrant, with aromas of pear, pink grapefruit and wet stones. Similar flavors carry onto the palate, which also tosses out some banana and melon. The finish is thinner than might be expected given the fact that this has a soft, big body.",18.0,87,8,0.9795773347375224
27564,Valley View 1999 Anna Maria Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Sweet, grapey fruit, plum and cherry, enhanced with peppery spice. The tannins are a bit ashy, but well integrated; with not too much oak. Overall, a balanced and elegant approach.",30.0,87,8,0.9795773347375224
