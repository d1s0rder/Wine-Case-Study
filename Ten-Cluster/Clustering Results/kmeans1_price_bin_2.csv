960,Sandeman 2015 Quinta do Seixo Vintage  (Port),"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.",50.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
325,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",60.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
318,Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",66.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
4503,Maurodos 2008 San Román  (Toro),"One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018.",70.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
7946,Pascual Toso 2014 Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"If you love massive Argentine reds with purity of fruit and fine oak, then this blend is up your alley. Toasty blackberry aromas come with plenty of oak grain, vanilla and depth. This is profoundly deep on the palate, while toasty blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors finish with mocha and bracing tannins that aren't too rocky or hard. Drink through 2025.",74.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
10024,Campo Eliseo 2009  Toro,"Hailing from a warm region and a warm vintage, this is displaying maximum ripeness on the nose via raisin, prune, blackberry and fig aromas. In the mouth, this is loamy, chewy, a mile deep and rich as Bill Gates. Concentrated black cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha flavors conclude with baked notes, licorice and tobacco. So smooth, yet bullish. Drink through 2022.",85.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
316,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",85.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
10025,Cepa 21 2010 Malabrigo  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of spiced berry, coffee and balsam wood start slow and pick up intensity. This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028.",90.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
7958,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2014 Vinha da Francisca Red (Douro),"Always impressive, this wine is structured and powerful, with firm tannins that are still coming together. Packed with black fruits and tannins, it conveys a rich, almost Port-like quality, perhaps because the grapes are foot-trodden as in Port. Drink this wine from 2022.",100.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
7939,Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Red (Douro),"The estate is owned by the Olazabal family, descendants of Antonia Ferreira who created this and many other estates in the 19th century. This is a major wine, ripe and full of rich tannins and concentrated fruit. It is always one of the longest-lived wines from the Douro and this vintage has the structure and the fruit weight to develop well. An attractive spicy, smoky character adds extra interest. Drink from 2022.",100.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
7952,Dr. Loosen 2014 Erdener Prälat Gold Capsule Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dulcet peach, apricot and citrus sweetness extends languorously from nose to finish in this powerfully ripe, hedonistic wine. It's dancing and delicate in frame, yet unctuously juicy, filling the mouth with a blanket of luminous fruit. Sprightly tangerine acidity and delicate tea-leaf tannins lend structure to a long, penetrating finish. It's irresistible already but should continue to drink well for decades.",114.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
320,Torbreck 2012 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2030.",125.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
967,Poças 2014 Símbolo Red (Douro),"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019.",150.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
5775,Numanthia 2009 Termanthia  (Toro),"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.",200.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
309,Torbreck 2012 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",225.0,97,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
2275,Artadi 2011 Viña El Pison  (Rioja),"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.",300.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
311,Oremus 2005 Eszencia  (Tokaji),"This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.",320.0,96,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
8904,De Toren 2014 Book 17 XVII Red (Stellenbosch),"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.",330.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
314,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly.",365.0,96,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
308,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",775.0,97,2,0.9994782402321725,above 40
