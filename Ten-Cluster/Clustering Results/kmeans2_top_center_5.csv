153,Domaine Berthoumieu 2013 Charles de Batz Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran),"Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",25.0,91,5,0.9977465607915165
195,Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.",32.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
565,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.",34.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
633,Château d'Esclans 2013 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak.

752,Clos Troteligotte 2013 K-libre Chenin Blanc (Côtes du Lot),"Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.",30.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
755,Domaine du Haut-Poncié 2013 Roche Grès  (Moulin-à-Vent),Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.,23.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
758,Georges Duboeuf 2013 Flower Label  (Beaujolais),"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste.",12.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
762,Manoir du Carra 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"While the wine has a crisp side, it's also full of red fruits and soft tannins. That makes for a wine that's fragrant, fruity, ready to drink and not likely to age much. Enjoy it now.",16.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
822,Frédéric Brouca 2013 Samsó Seulle Cinsault (Vin de France),"Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla.

918,Ruhlmann 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.",20.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
1019,Château du Retout 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.",20.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
1020,Château la Gravette Lacombe 2013  Médoc,The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.,18.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
1026,Château Vrai Caillou 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.",15.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
1040,Château les Lattes 2013  Médoc,"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste.",30.0,83,5,0.9977465607915165
1173,Domaines Landron 2013 La Louvetrie Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness.

1178,Domaine de l'Ermitage 2013  Menetou-Salon,"Lightly herbaceous, this is a ripe, lively wine. Grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are complemented by fuller apple and quince flavors. A tight minerality in the background will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2016.",20.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
1179,Domaine de Rome 2013  Sancerre,"This is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine that's filled out with a tangy, mineral texture. Grapefruit and lime juice flavors give a zesty feel as well as intense acidity. It is ready to drink.",21.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
1311,Château La Nerthe 2013 Cuvée des Cadettes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Purists will no doubt object to this wine's fine patina of sophisticated, cedary oak, but there's plenty of high-quality fruit to back it up. Incorporating unusual proportions of 44% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 23% Syrah, the fruit is ripe and lush, velvety-supple and medium to full in weight, without any sense of heaviness. Drink 2020–2030.",180.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
1392,Château de Chaintres 2013 Clos des Oratoriens  (Saumur),"This wood aged Chenin Blanc has a strongly oxidative character. It has lost its fruit in favor of grilled almonds, toast and intense acidity. Drink this mature wine now.",34.0,85,5,0.9977465607915165
1448,Château Mancèdre 2013  Pessac-Léognan,This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.

1449,Château Peyredon Lagravette 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structured—displaying more fruit than tannin—and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",22.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
1451,Clos Beauregard 2013  Pomerol,"This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins. Still dry from its dense structure, it's developing well. Drink from 2018.",58.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
1463,Château Amour 2013  Médoc,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",19.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
1465,Château de Rochemorin 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This is rich in spice, herbal characteristics and tangy acidity. It has a strongly mineral edge along with green fruits and tight lemon zest. Drink from 2017. André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973; the estate has grown vines since the 16th century.",26.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
1520,Château Pindefleurs 2013  Saint-Émilion,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,28.0,85,5,0.9977465607915165
1591,Univitis 2013 Château Les Vergnes  (Bordeaux),"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.",13.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

1606,Château Barreyre 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.",25.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
1607,Château Laronde Désormes 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.",25.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
1614,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits.

1615,Château Haut Boilon 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity.",15.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

1819,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2013 Anne de K Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine has a light, fresh character to go with the ripe spiced fruits. It's smooth with a tangy lime-zest flavor filled out with yellow fruits. Drink now.",19.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

2102,Château la Croix de Roche 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine has ripe red fruit flavors, a dry core, balanced tannins and plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.

2267,Domaine Zinck 2013 Terroir Pinot Gris (Alsace),Ripe pear on nose and palate is the central theme on this broad-shouldered and richly textured wine. A dollop of sweetness is countered with fresh lime acidity that concludes in ripe accord.,19.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
2349,Château de Chantegrive 2013  Graves,"The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus.

2890,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu),"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice.

3395,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2013 Paparazzi Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"As fresh and fruity as possible, this is a lively wine. Coming in a darkened bottle it looks stylish on a table, although its fragrant red fruits make it even better as an apéritif.",20.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
3450,Château Tour des Gendres 2013 Cuvée des Conti White (Bergerac Sec),"Dominated by ripe Sémillon, this is a rich wine.

4689,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rich and full-bodied, this displays much of the complexity of a Grand Cru wine.

5182,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Leimental Riesling (Alsace),"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",35.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
5183,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",55.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
5184,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Terroir d'Alsace Riesling (Alsace),"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",30.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
5340,Chateau d'Angludet 2013  Margaux,"This wine has attractive black-currant fruits and fresh, light acidity. It's an early-developing wine with soft tannins and a stalky backdrop. Drink from 2018.",45.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
5344,Château Haut Breton Larigaudière 2013  Margaux,"This wine is toasty and spicy with black-currant fruits that are still developing. It is fresh although its firm structure needs time to soften. As it matures, it will develop a balance between fruit and tannins. Drink from 2018.",40.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
5350,Château Marquis de Terme 2013  Margaux,This wine is solid and dense with probably too much extracted tannins. There are only hints of fruitiness. It will soften although it's likely to remain stalky. This is the first vintage in which some of the vineyard was managed organically.,33.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
5378,Kuentz-Bas 2013 White (Alsace),"At one moment there is a whiff of fresh apple, the next a hint of wet earth and orange peel. Brisk and dry, the palate also veers from rounded fruit to earthier, funkier notes. It finishes clean and refreshing.",12.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165

5608,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2013 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016.",15.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
6015,Château d'Or et de Gueules 2013 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Another terrific value from the Costières de Nîmes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbs—think thyme, rosemary, lavender—with ripe blueberries and roasted meat.

6187,Domaine de l'Ecu 2013 Granite  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"While the wine is rich and seriously textured, it has a pure fruitiness that is beguiling, ripe and full of green and citrus flavors. Spice and minerality give a strong sense of structure and ageability. Drink this firm wine from 2016.",23.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
6250,Château Larrivaux 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This wine is dry and likely to remain so. That's because the black currant flavors are too light for the structure, resulting in high acidity, firm tannins and a hole in the middle.",28.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
6360,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Tradition Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more. While there is not a lot of substance there certainly is lots of refreshment.,18.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165

7429,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm.

8387,Ogier 2013 Héritages Elevé en Foudres de Chêne Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable.

8651,Marquis de Goulaine 2013 Le Puy Ferrand Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Showing its youthful side, this is a breathtakingly fresh wine with intense acidity and tight grapefruit flavors.

9774,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2013 Altenberg-Bergbieten Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027.",80.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165

18500,Château de Chantegrive 2013 Cuvée Caroline  (Graves),"This wood-aged wine, one of the château's top white cuvées, needs to age. With its toast and ripe yellow and white fruits, it is rich and full, a reflection of good whites in a drab red Bordeaux vintage.

19871,Château la Mascaronne 2013 Fazioli Red (Côtes de Provence),This rich wine is still young and has all its tannins intact as well as ripe black fruits that push out of the dense structure.

19895,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Clos Sand Riesling (Alsace),"The smell of ripe yellow plum and the thick, waxy peel of Bramley apples sets the aromatic tone on nose and palate. There is richness here, and ample, rounded fruit, while the palate stays dry and is brightened in its broadness by pleasantly tart, clear lemon acidity.

19946,Domaine Pfister 2013 Engelberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The yellow-fruited richness of mirabelle compote with a touch of vanilla becomes apparent on the nose. The palate is just as luscious as promised but also carries a welcome, thrilling streak of lemon oil at its core, brightening and framing the medium-sweetness with its zesty lift. A touch of pleasant phenolic bitterness can just about be felt, adding dimension to the palate. This is intriguing and exciting in the way it plays with richness and sweetness while keeping them on a very tight rein. Lovely. Drink 2017–2027.",45.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165

20074,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2013 Engelgarten White (Alsace),"Dried hayflowers and dried orange peel send a lifted scent. The palate is richer and rounder than the nose suggests, full of ample apple and pear fruit, but guided and held by fresh, clean acidity.

20401,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Probus Malbec (Cahors),"Named after the Roman emperor who allowed planting of vines in Cahors (and elsewhere in France), this wine is a fine expression of rich, concentrated Malbec. It is powered by its tannins and young black fruits at this stage and needs several years to present its full, rich and concentrated potential.

20466,Chateau Haut Rian 2013 Excellence  (Bordeaux Blanc),"This is a mature, wood-aged wine. It is rich in yellow fruits and toast flavors. It does retain a crisper, citrus side that keeps it fruity.

20487,Château de Chambrun 2013  Lalande de Pomerol,"The wine has simple red-berry flavors and a light layer of tannins. The acidity is probably too intense—a product of the vintage. But it is an attractive wine to drink now, finishing with its crisp aftertaste.",45.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
20728,Domaine des Aspras 2013 Les Trois Frères Red (Côtes de Provence),"A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine.

20787,Domaine de l'Aujardière 2013 La Noë Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this.

20902,Bougrier 2013 V Douce France  (Vouvray),"In this unbalanced, medium-dry wine, the fruit, the acidity and the sweetness don't seem to want to hang together. At the end, the acidity wins, while the rest of the wine is left behind.",14.0,81,5,0.9977465607915165
21079,Château Tournefeuille 2013  Lalande de Pomerol,"For a Lalande de Pomerol this wine has a high proportion (30%) of Cabernet Franc, giving a structure that shapes the ripe Merlot. It's juicy with black plums and has a core of dry tannins. Drink from 2018.",36.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
21089,Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Situated close to the city of Bordeaux, this estate has produced a Cabernet-dominated wine that has some firm tannins and a dry core.

21091,Château de Fieuzal 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001.",50.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165

21093,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"While showing too much wood at the moment, this wine has potential. The red berries and black currants promise a fruity future with good tannins in support. Give the wine a few years and drink from 2019.",83.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
21094,Château Lynch-Moussas 2013  Pauillac,"After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018.",71.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
21095,Château Trois Moulins 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This is a dense wine, full of blackberries and ripe tannins. Juiciness gives the wine the fruitiness that's typical of the best of the vintage. Acidity at the end emphasizes the freshness. Drink from 2017.",20.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
21139,Famille Laplace 2013 Maydie Tannat Vintage Tannat (Madiran),"Fortified Tannat makes for a rich while also tannic wine.

21143,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors),"This blend of Malbec, Merlot and Tannat is lean and austere—probably the effect of the vintage. That gives powerful tannins and less in the way of fruit. It's firm, hinting at more juicy fruit but likely to remain dry and structured. Drink from 2018.",34.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165

21249,Martin Schaetzel 2013 Eichberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Notes of Turkish delight and peach immediately signal opulence. The palate follows up with distinct sweetness that underlines the rich rose and peach flavors even more. There is an edge of freshness, but only just. Yet the palate is intense and pervaded by peach. Whether this is about intensity or sweetness will depend entirely on the food it is paired with.",45.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
21467,Michel Gassier 2013 Nostre Païs Red (Costières de Nîmes),"There are some terrific bargains to be found in the Costières de Nîmes, including this offering from Michel Gassier. This blend of 45% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 15% Carignan, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault, features scents of thyme and bay leaf alongside black cherry and plum fruit.

21599,Château les Valentines 2013 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Obviously a wine to drink on February 14, this is brightly fruity and crisp while showing some good dense flavors. Red fruits push through the citrus and grapefruit acidity to give a full-bodied, ripe wine.",25.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
21789,Domaines Schlumberger 2013 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The nose is subdued at first but then opens up into ripe apple notes with the zesty spice of grapefruit rind.

22073,Domaine Ostertag 2013 Zellberg Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Orange peel perfumes the rich pear notes and imbues them with the aromatic spice of citrus foliage and zest.

22074,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The restrained and floral opening of jasmine and mandarin peel leads to a palate that holds just a touch of residual sugar, filling this gorgeously balanced Gewurztraminer to the brim with sweet citrus swirls of tangerine, satsuma and mandarin.

22075,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Very ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelles and orange peel represent the aromatic top notes.

22112,Domaine Jean Sipp 2013 Kirchberg de Ribeauvillé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.",37.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
22113,Domaine Schoffit 2013 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Muscat (Alsace),There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.,45.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165

22322,Georges Duboeuf 2013 Flower Label  (Beaujolais-Villages),"With rich fruits, this is a ripe and full-bodied wine.

22334,Château Tour des Gendres 2013 Cuvée des Conti White (Bergerac Sec),"Dominated by ripe Sémillon, this is a rich wine. It has a touch of herbaceousness, but the yellow fruits, pears and stroke of lemon give a full-bodied, rounded feel. Wood aging adds further to the satisfying flavors.",17.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165

22834,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Mambourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Notions of ripe fresh pears and pear compote on the nose segue into the more pliable fruitiness of ripe mirabelle plums.

34548,Domaine Schoffit 2013 Harth Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"The subdued nose gives way on the palate to earthy apple, reminiscent of Russet, underlined by a vein of lemony acidity that brightens from the inside out. Lemony earthiness lingers on the dry finish.",25.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165

The palate comes with great concentration of still tightly coiled lemon zest notes but the aftertaste is almost salty. This is dry, linear, muscular and toned, affording glimpses of future grandeur through dense lemon and lime zestiness. Give this some time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.",57.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165

The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness.

The absolutely dry palate also has a touch of that earthiness and adds more apple-peel notions to the fruit while a vivid lemon brightness takes center stage. This is generous and earthy in a typically Alsatian idiom but then that freshness kicks in and takes this to another level.

55613,Château Haut-Bacalan 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.",96.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55614,Château Haut Beyzac 2013  Haut-Médoc,"From an estate just to the west of Saint-Estèphe, this wine is structured and firm. A dry core of solid tannins balances the black-currant fruitiness. The wine is firm now although it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.",29.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55615,Château Luchey-Halde 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"With attractive acidity, this perfumed wine has a bright character and plenty of black-currant flavors.

55616,Château Siran 2013  Margaux,This wine has an austere character that comes from the tight structure. There are only hints of possible fruit. It is likely to remain severe even as it matures.,30.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55626,Château Charmail 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Smoky wood aromas are repeated on the palate. Although prominent, they do not suppress the juicy blackberry flavors and crisp acidity. Already balanced, the wine is likely to mature quickly. Drink from 2017.",18.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55627,Château Latour-Martillac 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is dry, dominated by the new-wood flavors and toasty character that hide any fruit. The lean structure will probably remain. The property is owned by the Kressmann family.",30.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55628,Château Pomeys 2013  Moulis-en-Médoc,"This structured wine also has attractive layers of ripe fruits. Black-currant freshness balances with a dry tannic core and a rich juicy texture. It's going to be ready to drink soon, so only wait until 2017.",20.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
55647,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Brut Réserve Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"A very neutral nose leads to an equally neutral palate. There is a hint of earthiness and just the merest edge of citric verve, with oatmeal flavors associated with autolysis. While there is balance and freshness, this is a very straight-laced crémant.",22.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
55688,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Windsbuhl Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender. The wine is dry but powerful, holding at its core all the ripeness and fruit flavor from brilliant sunlight. It almost warms you from inside and goes on and on. Drink now till 2030.",80.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
55704,Domaine Ostertag 2013 Heissenberg Riesling (Alsace),"Spice-edged, rounded notes of ripe Mirabelle with playful, teasing topnotes of peach beckon from the glass. This aromatic, fruitful charm also fills the palate where a bright core of lemon freshness provides verve and structure that also suggests stones and rock.

56424,Domaine Roumagnac 2013 Authentique Rosé (Fronton),"This is a rounded wine, soft and fruity. It has lost some freshness in the rich vanilla flavor that gives a ripe, full-bodied character. Red berry fruits at the end do leave a fresher aftertaste.",15.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

56429,Louis Jadot 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"A ripe, fleshy wine, full of cherry notes and spice. It is rich, full in the mouth while keeping a light fruitiness that allows it to develop fast. Overpowering banana flavors at the end spoil the overall effect.",14.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

56434,Domaine de Roche Guillon 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"While the acidity is intense, it is balanced by the ripe cherry fruits and soft tannins. This is not a wine for aging much beyond 2014, showing a bright, fresh aftertaste.",15.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165
56437,Gérard Charvet 2013 La Réserve d'Amélie  (Moulin-à-Vent),"Lean and firm, the wine has a dry, tannic layer that is emphasized by a burnt, smoky character. The fruit needs time and is likely to be austere.",22.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

56491,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Leimental Riesling (Alsace),"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",35.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
56492,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine.

56493,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Terroir d'Alsace Riesling (Alsace),"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",30.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
56503,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Rosenberg Riesling (Alsace),"Ripe Williams pear with grapefruit overtones segues into a creamy, almost buttery rounded palate that nonetheless has the tautness and verve of pure citrus zest.

56630,Domaine Léon Boesch 2013 Le Coq Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This dry style of Pinot Gris brings out a strong acidity as well as ripe fruitiness.

56788,Sélection Laurence Féraud 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This wine displays attractive notes of bay leaf and thyme typical of the region, but they overshadow the cherry fruit.

57613,Domaine Ehrhart 2013 Rosenberg Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Inviting notions of damask rose signal richness and aromatic opulence and continue on the rounded, plush and almost oily palate.

57619,Henri Schoenheitz 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Freshly cut Conference pear turns fleshy on the palate, juicy and full of life and fruit. Despite the juiciness the wine is just off dry and toothsome with structure, poise and a lastingly satisfying pear finish.",20.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
57621,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Trois Chateaux Riesling (Alsace),"Aromas of peach and freshly cut apple peel turn into rounder notes of ripe, yellow plum on the palate.

57633,Robert Karcher et Fils 2013 Harth Riesling (Alsace),"Bright, friendly and pure mandarin flavors make for a very appetizing, fruit-forward wine. The same friendly, sunny mandarin fruit fills the palate with its tension between citrus tartness and luscious sweet freshness. Bruised apple peel makes an attractive appearance on the lasting finish that concludes with lots of freshness.",22.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
57634,Sipp Mack 2013 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose gives little away but the palate shows plump, rounded, ripe pear, edged with pleasantly phenolic bitterness.

65684,Château Grande Cassagne 2013 Rosé (Costières de Nîmes),"This is a simple but appealing rosé, defined by strawberry fruit, hints of chalk dust and a mouthwatering finish.",12.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
65685,Domaine de la Petite Cassagne 2013 Rosé (Costières de Nîmes),"Despite this wine's very pale color, it shows ample weight and a silky texture on the palate. Peach and melon flavors pick up hints of berry and citrus on the finish.",12.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
65724,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Ripe yellow apple and yellow plum notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate is equally fresh and full fruited, sporting sassy, defining freshness that makes it mouthwatering and appetizing.",17.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
65736,Charles Sparr 2013 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"An incredibly creamy notion of ripe pear rises from the glass. There are also hints of sultana. The aromatic effect is one of huge generosity. The palate, on the other hand, is taut and medium dry, corralling its richness with pleasantly bitter texture and pervading freshness. There is utter concentration, immense verve and freshness. A delicious and moreish contrast between utter precision and the abandon of generosity. The finish is long, dry and fresh.",24.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
65739,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2013 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Generosity, expressed by the scent of sun-ripened Bosc pear peel, becomes immediately apparent. The ripe and luscious pear aromatics pervade the palate with their fruity, almost floral charm. There is some residual sweetness, boosting these flavors even more, but balance is struck by shining freshness and a pear-peel texture to finish with beguiling freshness. This is textbook stuff and utterly moreish.",37.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
65756,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2013 Sonnenglanz Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness.",37.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
65758,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2013 Altenberg de Bergbieten Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Earth, apple and citrus align on the nose. The palate brings out more earthiness but also pits the notions of mellow baked apple against absolutely tart lemon freshness. Stone and earth cling constantly to these flavors and draw you in. The palate is pure and slender, totally dry and taut. The finish is of lasting lemon zest. This needs time but is full of promise. Drink 2020–2035.",33.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165
65986,Domaine Charles Baur 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rounded, rich and perfectly ripe pears are countered by spiced, candied lime peel. The two elements oppose each other equally and hold a poised, subtle balance, echoing long into the spicy finish.",19.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
65991,Leon Beyer 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Candy floss and mandarin on the nose suggest a fun, easy wine and the palate keeps the promise. This is a soft, easy, dry Gewurztraminer with a wonderfully slick mouthfeel and some phenolic grip. It's rich but presents a tight body.",29.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
66393,Domaine Dumas 2013  Brouilly,"Based in the cru villages of Chénas, Pierre-André Dumas also has vines in Brouilly. This is a soft fruity wine with attractive red cherry flavors and a minimum of tannins. It is fresh and light, ready to drink now for its fruitiness, although ready to age at least until 2019.",19.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
66567,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2013  Morgon,"Although this is a relatively light wine due to the 2013 vintage, it does manage to achieve many of the firm tannins of Morgon. It also has red berry fruits that are allied to fresh acidity. Drink from 2016.",20.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
66575,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2013 Villa Chambre d'Amour White (Vin de France),"Very perfumed, this lightly sweet and poised wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng.

66581,Ollivier Frères 2013 Domaine de la Grenaudière Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"This wine is still tight and closed. Hints of the lemon and fresh pear fruits are sustained by a crisp, mineral texture. This is a wine to age for a few months, so drink from 2016.",13.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
66638,Château Lamartine 2013 Prestige du Malbec (Cahors),"Still firm and structured, this pure Malbec wine is rich and tannic. At the same time, it has layers of ripe black fruits that are coming through strongly. The smoky, textured character of this wine comes from the wood aging that has added an extra layer. Drink from 2018.",18.0,91,5,0.9977465607915165
67032,Vignerons de Bel Air 2013 Le Py  (Morgon),"From the slopes of Côte de Py, this is a solid, powerful wine with dark tannins and a firm, still young structure. Cherry and plum fruits give weight. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2016.",21.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
67113,Château Bertinerie 2013 Grande Cuvée  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Totally herbaceous and crisp, this is a rich, citrus-flavored wine.

For it to calm down and broaden out, wait until the end of 2015.",14.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
67176,Hecht & Bannier 2013 Rosé (Languedoc),"Medium-pink in color, this looks immediately vibrant and fruity. Scents of mealy plum, berry and watermelon fill the bouquet, while the palate offers more austere flavors of red currant and sour pomegranate. Tart and sharp in acidity, the finish is short and brisk.",15.0,86,5,0.9977465607915165
67257,Caves du Val de France 2013 Jovly  (Vouvray),Nuts and lemons are the main flavors of this light and fruity wine. Acidity cuts through the lightly mineral texture. Drink now.,17.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

67304,Christian Leperchois 2013 Lunar Apogé Made with Organic Grapes Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Less successful than some other vintages, this is a crisp, earthy red. Ground pepper, clove and cinnamon mark cranberry fruit, ending dusty and tart. The blend is 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 10% Cinsault. Ecocert.",20.0,85,5,0.9977465607915165
67750,Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.",32.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
67765,Domaine Maby 2013 La Fermade White (Lirac),"Perhaps it is the large Clairette component (52%), but this blend finishes with an attractive tingle of lime that brightens the whole experience. Honeyed melon and traces of raw almond give the impression of softness, yet the wine remains refreshing. The balance is 26% Grenache Blanc, 13% Viognier and 9% Picpoul. Drink it now and over the next six months.",19.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
68127,Château les Arromans 2013  Entre-Deux-Mers,"Intensely herbaceous, this is a crisp, lemon and grapefruit-driven wine. Bright and fruity, it has a touch of minerality to keep it structured. Drink now.",12.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
68186,Trimbach 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020–2035.",34.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165
68219,Vidal-Fleury 2013 White (Côtes du Rhône),"This is largely Viognier from the Southern Rhône, and that's reflected in its aromas of honey and pineapple. The flavors are fresh and slightly herbal, but based in melon and pineapple. It's medium in body, then finishes on a mouthwatering citrus note.",14.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
68274,Château du Trignon 2013 Marsanne (Côtes du Rhône),"In any given year, one or the other of Trignon's varietal cuvées excels, and 2013 is a Marsanne year. The delicate aromas of white pepper and spring blossoms immediately intrigue, and the flavors don't disappoint. This wine is floral, spicy and fruity all at once, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",19.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
68280,Domaine des Tilleuls 2013 Les Quatre Chanteaux Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Because it is crafted from old vines from a single parcel, this wine has been released a year later than usual for Muscadet. The result is a wine that has lost its puppy acidity while gaining ripe fruit and a soft texture. The wine was aged for 18 months on lees, which also contributed to its richness. Drink this delicious wine now.",15.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
68403,Les Vignerons des Terroirs de la Noëlle 2013 Château d'Amour Vieilles Vignes  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Clisson),"The cellar of this estate once became a secluded meeting place for lovers, bringing about the name of the wine.

68407,Yves Leccia 2013 E Croce Red (Patrimonio),"This wine is full, structured and still developing, with a bitter-chocolate edge that give a sharp character. This is balanced with warmer black-fruit flavors and acidity. The wine has great potential and needs another year. It will be best from the end of 2017.",36.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
68683,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Quintessence Extra Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Ripe mirabelle fruit plays on the nose and leads onto a very rich, creamy but fresh palate. This is autolytic generosity set against bright lemony fruity freshness. The creamy mousse adds to the creaminess even more but also accentuates spiky lemon. The palate is bone dry but full of rich flavors. This is lovely now but will gain from bottle age. Drink 2017–2025.",35.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
68686,Domaine Pfister 2013 Blanc de Blancs Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Very vivid notes of green citrus signal refreshment and lightness. The palate confirms this near weightless lightness and underlines it with fine tiny bubbles that fizz away creamily, providing a counterpoint and resulting in a wine that is both exquisitely light, dry, creamy and elegant. If you are looking for a sophisticated but light apéritif, this is your answer.",30.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
68696,Vignoble des 2 Lunes 2013 Poussière d'étoiles Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Creamy notes of strawberry shortcake make for an alluring nose.

68890,Joseph Fritsch 2013 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The wine is crisp, packed with grapefruit flavors and with a tight texture that suggests it could age.

68978,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"For once, I wasn't able to pick this wine out as a Tardieu-Laurent. The oak is reined in, leaving the focus on plummy yet savory notes of coffee and black olive, mint, clove, licorice and chocolate liqueur. It's full-bodied, firm and intense, with a long finish framed by dusty but ripe tannins. Drink now–2025+.",58.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
69121,Domaine Labruyère 2013 Le Clos du Moulin-à-Vent  (Moulin-à-Vent),"This is a concentrated structured cru wine from a single vineyard. It has dark tannins and a dense spice character from the wood aging. The fruit is still developing to give the wine its potential richness. Drink this firmly structured wine from 2018. This walled vineyard is wholly owned by producer Edouard Labruyère, making it a monopole.",80.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
69212,Ogier 2013 Oratorio  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Oak aging has added layers of vanilla and cinnamon, clove and menthol to this wine's ample black cherry fruit. There's a velvety plushness unusual for Crozes-Hermitage, but it adds welcome dimension to the finish.",36.0,91,5,0.9977465607915165
69265,Château Margaux 2013 Pavillon Blanc  (Bordeaux Blanc),"This fresh, crisp wine hovers attractively between crisp, herbal Sauvignon and riper yellow fruits. Touches of wood adds richness to this already-drinkable wine. Drink now or better, from 2017.",190.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
69266,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2013  Margaux,"Always one of the top performers in Margaux, this dense and concentrated wine has a bold, ripe character from the plum and berry fruits. It has the weight to develop. Drink from 2020.",54.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
69268,Les Astéries 2013  Saint-Émilion,"Tight, textured and mineral, this wine just hints at the fruit to come. It is dark, brooding and concentrated, with black-plum flavors just beginning to shine through the dry texture. It needs aging, so drink from 2022.",130.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
69270,Domaine Clarence Dillon 2013 La Clarté de Haut-Brion  (Pessac-Léognan),"Fresh citrus and tangy orange give this perfumed wine both fruitiness and a tight, mineral texture.

69303,Château Ferran 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is balanced between fresh acidity and ripe apricot and pear flavors. It is textured, showing a light minerality but not enough to mask the fruits. Drink from 2017. Denis Dubourdieu and Christophe Ollivier consult with manager Philippe Lacoste for the Beraud-Sudreau family.",25.0,89,5,0.9977465607915165
69305,Château la Fleur Peyrabon 2013  Pauillac,"A small portion of Château Peyrabon lies in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified separately. This is a surprisingly light wine for its appellation, fresh with fruitiness rather than structured. It has attractive black-currant acidity and a core of smoky tannins.

69308,Château Lestage Simon 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Part of the large Grand Chais de France group, this estate has been thoroughly renovated.

69656,Domaine Coustarret 2013 Renaissance  (Jurançon Sec),"Situated on 12 acres in the Pyrénées foothills, Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret could mimic their wine: still young and will age well. With a dominance of Petit Manseng in the blend, this is a lightly honeyed wine even if it is dry. Mangos and apricots are lifted by such fresh acidity and beautiful orange zest tanginess.

69943,Château Lagrézette 2013 Le Pigeonnier Malbec (Cahors),"This wine is always immense and the latest release, from a six-acre parcel surrounding Lagrézette's 17th century dovecote, is no exception. There is a sense of pent-up power here although it is not without its stylish elegance. Because it still so young, the black fruits stand out along with the concentrated tannins. It explodes in the mouth; dark and brooding. Drink this wine from 2022.",400.0,94,5,0.9977465607915165

70109,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.",120.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165
70114,Martin Schaetzel 2013 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Softly scented with tart apple and fresh citrus, this unfolds into an array of shimmering, tart, fresh but full-fruited apple notes.

70571,Henri Bourgeois 2013 La Bourgeoise  (Sancerre),"Produced from the oldest vines on the Bourgeois family estate, this is a flint and steel-textured wine. The fruit is still coming through the intense texture of this complex wine. The hints of apple and grapefruit will develop as the wine ages. Unlike so many Sancerre, this needs to age.

71681,Domaine Gresser 2013 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose gives little away and is very shy. The palate, however, is a paradigm on lemony freshness—of textured candied lemon and pear richness and great concentration.

76594,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2013  Pauillac,"Unusual for a Bordeaux, this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has plenty of tannins, although they are embedded in the pure black-currant fruits and the acidity. It shows the gentle side of Comtesse—fruit and freshness—although with spice and a touch of wood that are likely to balance soon. The wine will develop well over the next few years. Drink from 2022.",120.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
76598,Château Clerc Milon 2013  Pauillac,"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins and still showing some of the wood-aging. Red-berry fruits are cut with crisper blueberries and considerable acidity. This is going to be a firm wine that is lightened by the fruit, and a very good representative of the vintage. Drink from 2020.",59.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
76621,Château Cos d'Estournel 2013 Les Pagodes de Cos  (Saint-Estèphe),"This wine has a good structure that's overlaid with wood flavors and given richness by the generous black fruits, but everything is in balance.

77427,Boeckel 2013 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Sylvaner (Alsace),"Incredible purity rises from the glass, reminiscent of iced pear slices on a bed of the freshest chervil. The palate is filigree and savory, lithe, translucent but intense and shimmering with stone and earth, with pear and apple, with chervil and tangy peel. What light-footed, concentrated and yet elegant joy. This is resolutely dry and shows what Sylvaner does in the right hands.",34.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
77430,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2013 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Aromatic but tart notes of kumquat signal concentration and citric poise.

77434,Martin Schaetzel 2013 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Lifted notes of beeswax and chamomile signal maturity. In contrast to these wonderfully evolved notes, the palate sings with freshness and verve. This is resolutely dry but full of charm, despite its serious if gentle nature. The body is characterized by fluidity, concentration, warmth and freshness. A great joy that lasts long after the last sip.",40.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
77448,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Notes of beeswax, mirabelle plum compote and faint cardamom spice suggest a wine no longer in the first flush of youth. This is a compounded, rich but dry, layered but ultraclean wine. The palate reveals textured notes of gingerbread framed by the ripe fruit of ripe, dried yellow plums and even stored winter apple. There is just an echo of peach on the finish. This has lots of substance.",50.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
77591,Château Coussieu-Coutelin 2013  Saint-Estèphe,The wine is almost mature. It has a minty edge with some firm tannins and plenty of balanced fruit and acidity.

77612,Domaine des Remizières 2013  Crozes-Hermitage,"This is a svelte, easy-drinking style of Crozes. Cassis-scented fruit dominates, with perhaps just a hint of vanilla, but doesn't show much complexity. Ample weight and and an open-knit texture makes it already approachable.

77771,Benoît Daridan 2013 Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny),"The magnificent chateau of Cheverny is a fitting focal point for the wines of this small appellation. This wine is light in color, young and fruity. Soft tannins and red berry fruits are rounded and easy to drink. The wine is ready to enjoy although it could age through 2017.",18.0,87,5,0.9977465607915165
78041,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.",120.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165
78042,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone.",65.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165
78045,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035.",100.0,96,5,0.9977465607915165
78057,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035.",50.0,95,5,0.9977465607915165

78124,Domaine Mersiol 2013 Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Both ripe, red apple and juicy Mirabelle plum make an enticing appearance.

78886,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Faintly spiced, ripe apple and pear notes on the nose are mellowed by gentle, barely-there sweetness on the palate.

78890,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Eichberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"High, bright notes of the ripest pears pervade everything. They are edged with the slightly bitter tinge of fir honey which counters the sweetness of the fruit. This is balanced, off-dry and finishes with pleasant warmth.",44.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165
79381,Domaine Sérol 2013 Oudan Gamay (Côte Roannaise),"From a single parcel in the estate, this is a full and rich wine with impressive intensity and concentration.

79411,Boeckel 2013 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Strawberry hints and floral overtones promise pleasure that arrives on the dry, creamy palate.

79928,Château du Trignon 2013 Roussanne (Côtes du Rhône),"Plump and round in the mouth, with clean, fresh flavors of pear and pineapple. This year, the Marsanne is better, although the Roussanne should win friends for its charming fruit.",19.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165

80501,Henri Bourgeois 2013 La Chapelle des Augustins  (Sancerre),"Chalk and flint soil contribute to this tight, tangy, amazingly crisp wine.

80614,Château Beaubois 2013 Cuvée Expression Syrah-Grenache (Costières de Nîmes),"The value to be found in Costières de Nîmes from the 2013 vintage is impossible to overstate.

80922,Château Eugénie 2013 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"Like most Tradition wines in Cahors, this fruity and perfumed wine has been aged in stainless steel to keep the fruitiness.

81050,Château Ollieux Romanis 2013 Atal Sia Red (Corbières-Boutenac),"A blend of 45% Carignan, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this is a beautifully expressive, well-balanced Corbières-Boutenac red.

81153,Château de Chambert 2013 La Tour Chambert Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"From vineyards at the top of slopes above the river Lot, this balanced wine moves easily between red cherry acidity and dark, young tannins.

81160,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rounded notes of Bosc pear flesh and peel play softly on nose and palate. There is a very pleasant, slightly bitter phenolic edge, reminiscent of marzipan and a slight sweetness. Together they make for an intriguing and moreish contrast against a fluid, textured palate. The finish is off dry and has that marzipan edge.",50.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
81220,Gérard Bertrand 2013 Château La Sauvageonne Grand Vin White (Coteaux du Languedoc),"Mature notes of dried apple skin, orange marmelade, toasted nuts and popcorn unfold on the nose of this rich, savory wine.

81239,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Collection Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rather closed on the nose, this shows plump, sweet pear fruit countered by sprightly, spiky, lemony acidity. This is lively and fruity and easy to drink; enjoy while flavors are at their peak.",25.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165

81258,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu),"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice.

81950,Domaine de la Mordorée 2013 La Reine Des Bois  (Tavel),"This is Mordorée's top cuvée of Tavel, and it earns that distinction by virtue of its length and stoniness on the finish.

The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything.

91631,Château Phélan-Ségur 2013  Saint-Estèphe,"This wine brings out the tannic side of Saint-Estèphe. However, the 2013 is less wood-laden than some previous vintages from this estate, allowing more room for the fresh fruits and ripe tannins. The wine therefore has good potential, drink from 2020.",40.0,90,5,0.9977465607915165

91634,Château Vieux Robin 2013  Médoc,"This wine is firm, solid and dense with ripe black fruits. It is structured, with a dry core that needs to round out.

91677,Cave des Producteurs de Vouvray 2013 Les Fosses d'Hareng  (Vouvray),"This dry wine has that combination of tight minerality and great acidity that is common to young Chenin Blanc.

91770,Vignobles Berthier 2013 Terre de Silex Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois),"This is one of a range of three wines from different soils.

92084,Emile Beyer 2013 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"With a sense of structure and balance between honey and fruit, this is an attractive, food-friendly wine.

92131,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases).

93067,Château Peyros 2013 Vieilles Vignes Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran),"Vines up to 50-years-old are the basis of this rich and tannic wine. While it does have some age, it still has a way to go.

93824,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Quintessence Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A rich blend of dried pear, baked vanilla and shortbread on the nose suggests the richness of this evolving Pinot Gris. Dried pear and apple give more aromatic nuance to this spicy, vanilla-scented white that has an oily and rich palate despite being just off dry. This will shine with food.",38.0,91,5,0.9977465607915165

The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness.

94564,Domaine Gresser 2013 Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Aromatic notes of green, yellow and red-cheeked apples waft enticingly from the glass.

100525,Château Sainte Barbe 2013 Merlot du Château Sainte Barbe  (Bordeaux),"This 100% Merlot is firm, dry and structured. Although the fruit is there, it has been submerged by tannins. Give it a few months for the ripe berry flavors to come through. Drink from 2016.",14.0,84,5,0.9977465607915165

100690,Domaine des Coteaux des Travers 2013 Char à Vin Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan delivers just what you'd expect from the appellation, it just does it better than most, at a modest price.

101049,Château Aney 2013  Haut-Médoc,"A high proportion (65%) of Cabernet Sauvignon has given this wine a structured character. It's also brought out black-currant flavors that are allied to juicy acidity. The wood-aging was almost too much, giving the wine a bitter edge that needs to soften.

101967,Zusslin 2013 Brut Zéro Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit.",39.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165

102428,Clos Venturi 2013 Pur Sciaccarellu Sciaccerellu (Corse),"This widely found local grape has produced a crisp, wine full complex berry and black fruits that are balanced with tannins.

102599,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Praelatenberg de Kintzheim Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Spiced, baked apple constitutes the main aroma on nose and palate: ripe but tart baked fruit scented with edges of cinnamon and citrus.

103059,Domaine du Colombier 2013  Crozes-Hermitage,"This may not be as potent or complex as Colombier's Cuvée Gaby, but it comes close, which makes it an excellent value.

103110,Boeckel 2013 Brandluft Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"Yellow plum, sweet apple and juicy pear form an appetizing, aromatic trinity. Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate. With some time, honeyed notes come to the fore and suggest that many things still lie hidden in this fruit-laden Riesling. The finish is dry, the entire wine is focused and still taut. It's delicious now but will reward cellaring.Drink 2015–2025.",30.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165

103277,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2013 Mambourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Subtle but persistent notes of ripe pear, sandalwood and mirabelle appear on the nose. The palate is powerful and concentrated, weighing in with bundled notes of ripe orange zest that lend bright structure to an abundance of pear and earth notes. This is a big ripe wine, full flavored and potent. It has barely begun its trajectory and will acquire even more spice and allure over the years. This really is one to lay down.

103542,Ogier 2013 Oratorio  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Oak aging has added layers of vanilla and cinnamon, clove and menthol to this wine's ample black cherry fruit. There's a velvety plushness unusual for Crozes-Hermitage, but it adds welcome dimension to the finish.",36.0,91,5,0.9977465607915165
103563,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre),"Produced from old vines in Verdigny, this is rich while still totally crisp.

104313,Domaine François Schmitt 2013 Riesling (Alsace),"The broader focus of ripe, juicy yellow plum on the palate is subsumed into a defining lemon freshness that has some of the concentration and unctuousness of lemon oil. The finish is tart, dry and lip-smacking.",19.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165
104315,Domaine Ostertag 2013 Barriques Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Very rich, almost overripe pear dominates the palate, which also has a rich marzipan edge. Residual sugar is just about cut by citrus freshness. This is at the cusp of being just a little too much.",37.0,88,5,0.9977465607915165

104429,Domaine Cauhapé 2013 Sève d'Automne  (Jurançon Sec),This powerful and rich wine wants to be sweet but is bone dry. Hints of honey accompany opulent ripe peach and spiced pear flavors. The balance of the acidity is crisp and refreshing. Drink from 2017.,35.0,92,5,0.9977465607915165
104493,Domaine Labruyère 2013 Coeur de Terroirs  (Moulin-à-Vent),Wood-aging flavors have given this cru wine a toasty character that balances its natural fruitiness.

104857,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Riesling (Alsace),"A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",55.0,93,5,0.9977465607915165
