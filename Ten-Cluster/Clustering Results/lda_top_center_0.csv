It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya.

32363,Felten Cellars 2012 Gewurztraminer (Paso Robles),"Extremely light in color, this dry wine has aromas that show Key lime pie, apple blossom and white rocks. It's tight and interesting on the bone-dry palate, with chipped chalk followed by apple tart, Bosc and Asian pear, lime juice and pith, and a dainty touch of honey on the finish.

3571,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend.

42387,Williams Selyem 2010 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey.

The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull.

13613,Cullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate.

40944,D.H. Gustafson 2010 Heritage Tree Vineyard Riesling (Dry Creek Valley),"An interesting step toward persuading Americans to like Riesling. That's because it takes the variety's citrus, flower and petrol notes and finishes them slightly sweet, like an orange and apricot fruit drink.

25271,Cono Sur 2006 Visión Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"There's no escaping the asparagus and canned bean aromas that consume the bouquet, but those scents do fade after a while and the nose eventually leads to flavors of lime, white peach and citrus.

33602,Six Sigma Ranch 2006 Michael's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Lots of new French oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring went into the making of this wine, and it shows the yeasty richness and creamy texture of that expensive handling.

73885,Sylvestra 2015 Brut Nature Rosé  (Mendoza),"From Familia Bressia, this Brut Nature smells like a cross between a frosted doughnut and dried tropical fruits.

111398,Concha y Toro 2001 Block 25 Terrunyo Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"At first the nose is like caramelized popcorn, a forward combination of oak and toast.

27563,Wairau River 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefruit and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart.

68143,Emina 2009 Selección Personal Carlos Moro Verdejo (Rueda),"This style of oak-fermented Verdejo probably does better in cool years, which 2009 was not. As a result, this smells a bit oxidized and nutty, with baked apple scents. In the mouth, it is weighty and a touch dull; flavors of butterscotch and cashew finish with cider, salt and buttery notes. Drink now.",35.0,87,0,0.9437393469434623
12342,Kumeu River 2007 Pinot Gris (Kumeu),"Despite sufficient residual sugar to render it off-dry, this Pinot Gris retains a slightly tart, lean character. Underripe stone fruit and pineapple flavors lack richness and generosity, ending on a tart, citrusy note.",22.0,84,0,0.943739308413204
33488,Andretti 2012 Montona Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Oaky flavors of buttered toast and vanilla bean dominate this Chardonnay. It's also ripe in mango, pear, apricot and orange flavors allied with acidity. But the overall quality is average.",50.0,86,0,0.9437393033707281

33733,Solar de la Vega 2007 Verdejo (Rueda),"Typical for the region, and nicely done for the price.

3440,Noble Vines 2013 242 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"There's a pleasant sweetness to the nose, a mix of white flowers and fragrant apples. On the palate, green banana, apple juice and papaya rise to the occasion. A strong minerality holds through the finish.",13.0,88,0,0.9437392650809746
16031,Viña Maipo 2009 Gran Devoción Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"An authentic Chilean Sauvignon Blanc with celery and green-bean aromas along with oceanic salty notes.

48492,Midnight 2008 Aurora Reserve White (Paso Robles),"Lots of exotic citrus, peach and tropical fruit flavors in this crisply clean blend, but it's really too sweet to qualify as a dry table wine. Tastes more like something you'd have for dessert.",28.0,82,0,0.9437391781427296
65094,Mercer Canyons 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The new Mercer Canyons label gets off to a good start with this Chardonnay that's low in alcohol and clean.

39650,Marisco Vineyards 2014 A Sticky End Late Harvest Waihopai Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Unlike Marisco's 2015 The Ned Late Harvest, this is a botrytis-affected wine, featuring a darker color and more complex flavors. The aromas suggest Earl Grey tea and honey; the flavors resemble caramel-drizzled orange segments. A slightly bitter citrus-pith note marks the finish, providing balance.",23.0,91,0,0.9437390889052901
15920,Santa Ema 2015 Select Terroir Unoaked Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),"Tropical aromas of melon, pineapple juice and canned pears are friendly.

85798,Mar de Viñas 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Fresh apple and nectarine aromas are clean and appealing. This is round, lifted and correct in terms of mouthfeel. Fleshy nectarine and apple flavors finish minerally, a touch briny and long. Drink now.",17.0,90,0,0.9437389761359507
110343,Familia Schroeder 2008 Saurus Patagonia Select Sauvignon Blanc (Neuquén),"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors.

25385,Buried Cane 2008 Chardonnay (Washington),"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay.

5032,Carl Ehrhard 2008 Rudesheimer Kabinett Dry Riesling (Rheingau),"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development.
