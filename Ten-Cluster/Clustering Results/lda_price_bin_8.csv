84000,Saxum 2005 James Berry Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"Solidly in the Saxum style, which is to say a high alcohol (15.5%), massively flavored wine of enormous concentration and power. The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache.",55.0,95,8,0.9549899149530973,above 40
14786,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Estate Vineyard Etzel Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way.",60.0,96,8,0.9437400197442588,above 40
106556,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2012 Foothills Reserve Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Locked up tightly on first pour, this wine shows brooding aromas of black pepper, smoked meat, brown stems, olive and herbs. It explodes across the palate with rich yet elegant, nuanced savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It will be best after 2020.",65.0,95,8,0.9499897977268751,above 40
98027,D'Arenberg 2010 The Swinging Malaysian Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"D'Arenberg's lineup of single-vineyard Shirazes is especially impressive in the 2010 vintage, and this was one of my favorites. The aromas are tight, nearly impenetrable at first, then only stubbornly yielding hints of graphite, but the mouthfeel is expansive and richly textured. Aristocratic notes of pencil shavings balance supple tannins and layers of dark fruit, concluding in espresso and chocolate on the finish. Drink now–2030.",85.0,96,8,0.9571309452272284,above 40
48609,Lynmar 2013 Five Sisters Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is a standout in an outstanding portfolio of 2013 vineyard- and block-designated wines from this producer. Five Sisters is big and burly at first, a fistful of leather and Asian baking spices that demands notice. Then subtlety takes over in lithe, sinewy waves of blueberry and blackberry, followed by a touch of licorice on the nearly endless finish.",100.0,97,8,0.9499916119706171,above 40
38981,CVNE 2010 Real de Asúa  (Rioja),"The best of CVNE's impressive lineup of 2010 high-end Riojas is this pure, staunch, ripe stud that's blasting with blackberry, woodspice, leather and cedar aromas. Lush, layered and deep as an ocean trench, this ultraripe, expressive wine pumps out blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors prior to a lush, mile-long finish. Amazingly pure and delicious; drink through 2025.",100.0,96,8,0.9571341794282864,above 40
1418,Marchesi Antinori 2008 Guado al Tasso  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Here's a “wow” wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come.",102.0,98,8,0.9499882743761262,above 40
75951,Torbreck 2012 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa),"The Factor is always one of Torbreck's biggest wines. The 2012 continues that tradition, offering ample weight, richness and texture. Alluring notes of Christmas spices and plum pudding mark the nose, while the flavors continue the dark theme, picking up hints of cola and roasted meat before finishing somewhere between creamy and velvety, spicy and peppery. Drink now–2030.",125.0,95,8,0.9608613935816288,above 40
36016,Emilio Moro 2009 Malleolus de Valderramiro  (Ribera del Duero),"After two marginal vintages (2007–08), this is Emilio Moro and Ribera del Duero at their finest. This Tinto Fino delivers a huge wave of mocha, blackberry, tobacco and coffee aromas in front of a dense and layered palate that's packed with prune, chocolate, cassis and blackberry flavors. A savory, richly textured finish overflowing with coffee, chocolate and smoky flavors seals the deal. Drink from 2015–2022.",130.0,96,8,0.9608610664063705,above 40
112787,Quilceda Creek 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron. As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.",135.0,98,8,0.8886201637845206,above 40
98393,Charles Smith 2013 Royal City Northridge Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas pop, with notes of stargazer lilies, brown stems, green olive and smoked meat, revealing more on each swirl. The fruit and savory flavors are rich and layered, earthshaking in their intensity, with a lengthy finish that only heightens the interest. It's a complete showstopper.",140.0,96,8,0.9356987313971757,above 40
74744,Charles Smith 2008 Royal City Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An Amaro-like mix of bitters and herbs; this is exceptionally dense and dark. The fruit is a grace note; the big flavors come from herb, earth, rock, barrel and more. Licorice, baking spices, smoke, black cherry, Bourbon barrel, and on it goes. Huge and dense and seemingly endless.",140.0,98,8,0.959084125639778,above 40
75952,Nashwauk 2010 Beacon Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Nashwauk is Kaesler's McLaren Vale project, first released from the 2006 vintage. The 2010 is full bodied, creamy-textured and plush, filled with dark fruit and hints of vanilla, asphalt, maple syrup and mocha. The supple tannins enhance rather than impede the finish, contributing scary length. Drink now–2030.",145.0,95,8,0.9549869473053726,above 40
59862,Hall 2013 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.",165.0,95,8,0.9499920762816049,above 40

70835,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Solaia Red (Toscana),"The 2004 Solaia is dense and concentrated with loads of character and defining aromatics: plump blackberry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, peppercorn and smooth balsam notes. The real pleasure comes in the mouth where it delivers smooth elegance and an extra long finish.",170.0,96,8,0.9549882124684647,above 40
67962,Masi 2003 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This has enormous richness and intensity, with penetrating aromas of leather, tobacco, spice, dark fruit and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's inky, rich and supersmooth. This is one of the best Italian wines ever made from the difficult 2003 vintage.",175.0,96,8,0.9437410366209122,above 40
104003,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This 100% varietal, barrel-fermented wine from the hallowed site delivers a grip of tension and balanced weight, providing power within its layers of texture. Earthy and pungent with tobacco and herb scents, it offers leather, cedar and black cherry flavors in equal amounts, finishing with length and grace.",250.0,97,8,0.965376441889952,above 40
104001,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"From another of the grower's impressive, coveted sites, this wine imparts soft, dusty cherry, cassis and pomegranate notes, with a luxurious tease of vanilla and coconut macaroon. Full-bodied and robustly built, it's 100% varietal and barrel-fermented and finishes on a compelling streak of cedar, herb and graphite.",250.0,98,8,0.9590810452413532,above 40
112791,Gaja 2009 Sorì San Lorenzo Nebbiolo (Langhe),"There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb.",495.0,96,8,0.9437387907638314,above 40
