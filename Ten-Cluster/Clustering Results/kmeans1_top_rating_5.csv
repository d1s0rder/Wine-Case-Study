8889,Mailly Grand Cru 2008 Les Echansons  (Champagne),"The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintage—this is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine.",160.0,96,5,0.9999998234497582
8891,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",78.0,96,5,0.9999998234497582
8892,Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.",60.0,96,5,0.9999998234497582
8893,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 2017–2037.",29.0,96,5,0.9999998234497582
8894,Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",60.0,96,5,0.9999998234497582
