3,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics.

477,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets.

618,Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone.

1623,Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.",50.0,91,7,0.9706802810105034

Don't look for a blockbuster style; rather it's more delicate and refined.",55.0,90,7,0.9706802810105034

3411,Sojourn 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Grown in a celebrated vineyard, this Pinot isn't showing well at this point. It's heavy and soft, and the raspberry-cherry flavors are compromised by a vegetal quality. Decant and drink up.",54.0,86,7,0.9706802810105034

4701,Hyland 2012 Select Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Just one barrel was made of this reserve.

36651,Ram's Gate 2012 Bush Crispo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A strength of oak and burly black fruit in this single-vineyard designate makes it intense and big. In the background, an unexpected minty, forest floor quality overtakes the aromas at first, but blows off over time. The wine finishes as intensely as it starts, awash in toasty oak.",70.0,89,7,0.9706802810105034
36661,Iota Cellars 2012 Pelos Sandberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"A scent of leathery funk inhabits this wine, yet never overtakes the balanced flavors.

36781,Maldonado 2012 Los Olivos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"With deep color and generous, ripe fruit aromas, this gives a first impression of being a big wine—which it is.

36783,Elizabeth Chambers 2012 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Sturdy and tannic, this seems to be the heaviest and thickest of the 2012 wines from Elizabeth Chambers.

37003,Alloro 2012 Estate Justina Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This bottling, limited to just 25 cases, comes out scented with oaky toast, cherry pipe tobacco and baking spices. Flavors of spiced cranberries, strawberry preserves and cherry compôte carry it along into a finish streaked with vanilla.

37284,Siduri 2012 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Evoking the richness and slightly tart deliciousness of a strawberry-rhubarb compote, this is a bright, vibrant and chewy Pinot, its dry tannins peaking on the finish. From a great vineyard site long sourced by the producer, it's on the lighter side in terms of body and weight, and may need further time to come into its own, through 2017.",54.0,88,7,0.9706802810105034

38415,Vidon Vineyard 2012 Hans Clone Pommard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is locked up tight when opened, and remains massive but inscrutable for several hours.

38712,Sonoma-Cutrer 2012 Owsley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A smokiness rises to the fore initially in this wine, a toasted oak accent that marks its character.

38986,Archery Summit 2012 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Complex, classy winemaking is evident from the first sniff to the final sip. Savory notes of green tea and clean earth complement a terroir-driven wine. The notes and nuances pile on—flowers and fruits, cherry and cassis, with a whiff of barnyard and undergrowth. The lingering, expressive finish is already boggling, and seems sure to continue to evolve gracefully through 2025–2030.",100.0,95,7,0.9706802810105034

39908,Talley 2012 Proprietor Grown Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Coming from the Stone Corral Vineyard, this wine tends toward the browner side of the scent spectrum, with roasted root vegetables, baking spice and a bit of anise.

The acidity is high and the alcohol is low, making for an elegant mouthfeel. But what's especially pleasurable are the deep flavors of black cherries, blueberries, red currants and sandalwood.

52197,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Founders' Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Black cherry fruit is encased in dark barrel flavors of smoke, charcoal and espresso.

52204,Layer Cake 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"There's something delicious about this wine, but it's not very Pinot Noir-like.

53365,Armida 2012 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy and stemmy, the famed Bacigalupi is the source of grapes, a Wente field selection clone.

54016,J Vineyards & Winery 2012 Misterra Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews.",50.0,89,7,0.9706802810105034

54646,Signorello 2012 Nobles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Hugely brawny in dark blackberry, plum and cinnamon, this wine packs a punch despite its coastal influence.

54682,Johan 2012 Three Barrel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"As the name indicates, this limited reserve is a selection of the winemaker's best barrels. It was fermented with 90% whole clusters, and aged 15 months in one-third new French oak. There are ample scents and flavors of stem, leaf and root, which dominate.

80900,McCall 2012 Hillside Corchaug Estate Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"There's not a great quantity of Pinot Noir in Long Island, but McCall's is consistently one of the region's best producers of it. The Hillside Corchaug Estate is particularly refined, offering loads of ripe cherry and berry flavors calibrated neatly by zesty acidity and savory herb and smoke notes.

81633,Domaine Anderson 2012 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Complex and individualistic, this conveys a savory rather than fruity personality.

81827,Saxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich.

81961,Roots 2012 Racine Pinot Noir,"The winery's reserve bottling, this is named for the Wisconsin town from which the owners migrated. Coincidently, Racine also translates to roots in French.

Lovely fruit and a streak of iron give it a strong, grippy finish.",60.0,91,7,0.9706802810105034
81971,Sokol Blosser 2012 Peach Tree Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Peach Tree cuvée actually carries a whiff of peaches—possibly the power of suggestion. Its strawberry fruit includes an herbal component, more like a wine from the Eola Hills than Dundee. Overall structure is fine, and aging in 42% new oak puts some toasted coconut into the finish. This has the balance and persistence to age nicely through 2025.",70.0,91,7,0.9706802810105034
81972,Trombetta 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a newish, small producer that's worth keeping an eye on, this wine is earthy and slightly cloudy, balanced in nature.

82156,Ken Wright 2012 Meredith Mitchell Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Tasted along with a dozen other single vineyard selections from Ken Wright, this feels a bit thin, but only in relation to a portfolio of astonishing power and depth.

82306,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Winemaker Norm Yost's decision to release later than most of his neighbors pays off tremendously every vintage.

82693,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 AVA Series Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"The Momtazi vineyard supplies these grapes.

83388,Gros Ventre 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine was sourced from three vineyards along the West Sonoma Coast, from as far north as Annapolis and as far south as Sebastopol.

83396,Iron Horse 2012 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a vineyard block planted in 1990, this wine is distinguished by an earthy forest-floor characteristic, along with smoky oak and bacon, especially on the entry.

Amid the black cherry are accompanying flavors of brambly blackberry and a suggestion of savory cranberry, all integrating with the tannins. Cellar through 2022.",90.0,94,7,0.9706802810105034
85493,Dutton Estate 2012 Karmen Isabella Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Densely delicious, this is earthy in a forest floor kind of way—it's explosive in black cherry, plum and compelling, exotic spice.

85496,Flowers 2012 Sea View Ridge Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an intriguingly light, lean and savory wine, true to its extreme Sonoma Coast provenance.

85502,St. Rose 2012 Nunes Vineyard Ten Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a refined and restrained Pinot from a reputable grape grower who has successfully made the transition to winemaker.

85505,MacPhail 2012 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf. The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.",49.0,94,7,0.9706802810105034
85510,MacPhail 2012 Vagon Rouge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Herbal mint and strawberry counterbalance the density of oak and tannin that is the foundation of this wine. It hails from a handful of marquee vineyard sites, including Mardikian Estate, one of the producer's vineyard-designates. Right out the gate, it's a well-integrated tightrope of spicy fruit and acidity, with a tease of blueberry and cedar.",65.0,93,7,0.9706802810105034
85511,Merry Edwards 2012 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish.

85755,Irvine Family Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability.",35.0,89,7,0.9706802810105034
85756,Kelley Fox 2012 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome.",44.0,89,7,0.9706802810105034
85758,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 La Cantera Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component.

85759,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Z'ivo Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The vineyard is in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, though the label does not indicate it. There is a welcome purity to the fruit expression, pretty cherry flavors with a suggestion of hard candy.

85983,Kokomo 2012 Peters Vineyard Gopher Hill Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a former Gravenstein apple orchard, this Pinot is intense in white pepper and cherry pit, and not unlike the skin of an apple. The zesty acidity sizzles on the palate.",42.0,86,7,0.9706802810105034
86149,Irony 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"This Pinot shows the acidity of its coastal origins, and also is bone dry, with low alcohol that gives it a delicate texture. Flavor-wise, it's pretty thin, with watery cola and cherry jam notes.",16.0,83,7,0.9706802810105034
86273,Indigené 2012 Edna Valley Pinot Noir (California),"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own.",31.0,92,7,0.9706802810105034
86575,Kudos 2012 Single Vineyard Series Carabella Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This excellent vineyard has a proven track record, though here the grapes seem unevenly ripened, with brambly berry fruit that turns a little hot and raisined in the finish.

86699,Winderlea 2012 Dundee Hills Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Significantly riper than the elegant 2011, this well-priced cuvée has some real muscle.

87078,Spell 2012 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot is one-dimensional, although it originated in the famous Marimar Estate vineyard.

87098,Boekenoogen 2012 3 Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dried strawberries, saddle leather, crushed violets and a hint of maple make for a fairly straightforward yet appealing nose on this wine. Pomegranate, raspberries and purple florals show on the palate, but the tannic structure still is a bit wound up, and will unfold into more anise and sage in years to come. Drink 2018–2024.",46.0,93,7,0.9706802810105034
87103,Patz & Hall 2012 Chenoweth Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A vineyard source since 2004, this Chenoweth is earthy and distinctly intense, rich and robust in blackberry and black cherry with strong elements of black pepper and cinnamon. The acidity is balanced and veering on mineral, with subtle oak on the finish and a rewarding touch of dark chocolate. The density of the tannins suggest further cellaring, through 2020.",60.0,93,7,0.9706802810105034
87112,Brewer-Clifton 2012 Hapgood Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A bit lighter in color than the producer's other 2012 bottling, this shows aromas of fresh-pressed raspberry juice, cola, white sage, graphite and a hint of wet asphalt. It's light and airy on the palate, with more raspberry and pomegranate fruit as well as sage, thyme and anise. It provides great balance between ripe juice and herbal seasonings.",84.0,93,7,0.9706802810105034
87113,Calera 2012 de Villiers Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Hard cinnamon candies, cherry juice, pomegranate extract and a touch of balsamic vinegar combine for sharp, nose-tickling aromas on this organically grown wine from pioneering vintner Josh Jensen.

87187,Maysara 2012 Cyrus Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Aged in 30% new French oak, this cuvée opens with full, round, tart berry and cherry fruit.

87265,Boheme 2012 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Within an enclave of adored cool-climate vineyard sites, just under five miles from the ocean, Taylor Ridge is planted to the Swan clone of Pinot Noir.

87444,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Lois Louise Twisty Ridge Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This winery atop the mountains overlooking Silicon Valley makes amazingly earthy and age-worthy wines. This bottling's nose is soil-driven, with sun-baked loam laid across red cherry, condensed lilacs, cola and sandalwood aromas.

87460,Clos de la Tech 2012 Santa Cruz Mountains Estates Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Though much lower in price than the single vineyard offerings—and without the microchip on the label—this bottling carries all of the earthy aspects that characterize this iconoclastic winery.

87821,Domaine Divio 2012 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020.",48.0,91,7,0.9706802810105034

88410,Cooper Station 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"A dry, brittle mouthfeel and watery flavors of raspberries combine to make this wine rustic. It gets the basic Pinot Noir concept of silky smoothness and acidity across well enough, but not much else.",11.0,82,7,0.9706802810105034
88560,Omero 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Vibrant and young, this offers tart cranberry and raspberry fruit set against baking spice highlights. It spent 10 months in French oak, mostly neutral, and is a clean, crisply defined wine with plenty of life ahead.",28.0,88,7,0.9706802810105034
88621,Brittan Vineyards 2012 Gestalt Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This aptly expresses the characteristics of wines from the McMinnville AVA. A steely, peppery, gun-metal streak runs up and down the spine, with tight, compact blue and black fruits, ripping acidity, firm tannins and a light suggestion of root beer. It's all in place in a wine that seems destined for a life of two decades or longer.",55.0,94,7,0.9706802810105034
88630,Acacia 2012 Lone Tree Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A barrel selection from estate-grown grapes, this Pinot succeeds in rich red raspberry and an offering of strawberry-rhubarb pie, the texture velvety smooth.

88739,Colene Clemens 2012 Margo Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact.

88747,Argyle 2012 Spirithouse Knudsen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Warm cherry fruit enfolds the palate, with supporting, lemony acids.

88824,Adelsheim 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is an impressive effort, especially considering it is the winery's mass-production cuvée. All in proportion, it's built upon an acid/mineral base, with tangy, just-ripe berry fruit. It feels quite delicate, yet has the persistence and structure of a more substantial wine. Aged for 10 months in one-quarter new French oak, it's worth tucking a few bottles away for a long-term look.",32.0,92,7,0.9706802810105034

97294,Zagan's Fire 2012 Pinot Noir (Lodi),"There is not much in the way of fruit in this wine, which veers into questionable flavors of burnt mushrooms.",15.0,82,7,0.9706802810105034
97296,Peltier 2012 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi),"This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.",10.0,82,7,0.9706802810105034
97322,Sineann 2012 Yates Conwill Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Yates Conwill is next to the Resonance vineyard, which was just sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This vineyard is really reaching its prime, showing lovely ripe flavors of raspberry, red plum and sweet cherry. Generous acidity keeps the wine in proportion and leads through a generous midpalate with highlights of black tea and dried herb. Drink now and over the next 10 years.",42.0,94,7,0.9706802810105034
97353,Baxter 2012 Black Label Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression. Take a good sip and more crisp fruits like raspberries and red cherries emerge along with hints of cinnamon and clove for complexity. While medium bodied, it's vibrant in texture and elegantly balanced. It should improve through 2022.",38.0,92,7,0.9706802810105034
97577,Bouchaine 2012 Bacchus Collection Gee Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"From a 16-acre, dry-farmed vineyard near the producer's Carneros winery, this opens with a yeasty aroma, followed by black cherry and pomegranate. Soft, high in acidity and well-integrated in terms of oak, its finish is lingering in cinnamon and dried herb.",60.0,88,7,0.9706802810105034
97619,MooBuzz 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Deep black raspberry and slate make for a traditional nose on this solid-deal wine. It's refreshing and lively once sipped, with dark red fruits and a bit of brown spice.",15.0,88,7,0.9706802810105034
97621,R2 2012 S&B Sanford & Benedict VIneyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The Roessler brothers take a good spin through the historic Sanford & Benedict vines and present a wine with cherry, baked fennel and a bit of eucalyptus on the nose. It's fairly lean once sipped, but balanced well between pomegranate fruit and dark spices.",56.0,88,7,0.9706802810105034
