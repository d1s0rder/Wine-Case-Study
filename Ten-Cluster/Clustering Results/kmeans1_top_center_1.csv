211,Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge.

377,Macari 2010 Cuvée Gabriella Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring.

380,Ojai 2014 McGinley Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach.

381,ONX 2015 Indie Tempranillo (Templeton Gap District),"This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement.

383,Prospect 772 2014 Stepping Stones Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality.",27.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
386,Trione 2012 Henry's Blend Red (Alexander Valley),"Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot almost equal in proportion, this is a lovely, well-crafted wine, softly concentrated with highlights of licorice, lavender, violets and black pepper.

391,Wölffer 2013 Caya Cabernet Franc (Long Island),"Voluptuous blackberry and plum flavors are edged by hints of bitter coffee and spice in this richly bodied wine.

392,Dunbar 2012 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Berry crumble and licorice star in this full-bodied, hearty and smooth wine, blended with 4% Petite Sirah. Spicy oak and milk chocolate unleash further flavor and spice on the finish.",32.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
405,Chehalem 2012 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality.

418,Castello di Amorosa 2009 La Castellana Red (Napa Valley),"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.",88.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
421,Sparkman 2009 Stella Mae Red (Red Mountain),"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc.

432,Zerba Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
433,Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain),"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
437,MICA Cellars 2009 Babcock Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Suisun Valley),"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

442,Hanna 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity.

446,Camaraderie 2009 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
447,Camaraderie 2009 Tempranillo (Yakima Valley),"This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
448,Beringer 2014 Quantum Red (Napa Valley),"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.",65.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
457,Prospect 772 2014 The Brat Grenache (Calaveras County),"Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance.

458,Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley),"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
459,Qupé 2013 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard.

The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706

468,Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon),"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.",50.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
473,Northstar 2013 Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc.

484,Turiya 2011 Stolpman Vineyard Sangiovese (Ballard Canyon),"Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins.",150.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
488,Carlisle 2013 Pagani Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.",46.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
495,Terre Rouge 2014 Enigma White (Sierra Foothills),"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.",25.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
496,Limerick Lane 2013 Hail Mary Syrah-Grenache (Russian River Valley),"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone.",48.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
497,Limerick Lane 2013 Headpruned Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",45.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
499,Eighty Four 2010 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is big boisterous wine from Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer that has been given some nice time in bottle after four years in new French oak.

502,Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast),"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once.",100.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
507,Ardor 2015 Art Den Hoed Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish.

508,Berryessa Gap 2015 Albariño (Yolo County),"This wine tastes fresh and brisk, like apricots and lemons, yet a silky-smooth texture adds depth and interest to make it more than just a one-note, fruity style of wine.

925,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting.

1028,Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley),"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot.

1038,Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.",17.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

1104,Hecho por Ruben 2014 Syrah (Ballard Canyon),"Extremely lively peppercorn aromas meet with black plum, blackberry, dried violets and lavender on the nose of this bottling by vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano.

1114,Artesa 2014 Tempranillo (Alexander Valley),"From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity.

1131,Horan Estates 2005 HVH Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
1142,Hannah Nicole Vineyards 2010 Viognier (Contra Costa County),"This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish.",20.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

1156,Petroni 2010 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric.",24.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
1160,Brotherhood 2010 Riesling (New York),"Stunning aromatically, with a veil of smoke and petrol that lingers over fresh, clean Honeycrisp apple aromas.

1185,Rosenblum 2011 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This Zin speaks to compelling red fruit, plum and vanilla, with light oak presence.

1208,Crux 2013 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish.",38.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

1223,14 Hands 2010 Riesling (Washington),"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis. Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit.",10.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

1228,Flying Trout 2010 Cutthroat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together.

1233,Penumbra 2010 Petite Sirah (North Coast),"It's hard to get around the tannins that battle in this wine, which is savory and dark with a smoky aura. Lay it down another couple of years or let it air out a bit before pouring.",23.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

1251,Stevenot 2007 Rosado Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo.

1254,Fenestra 2006 Silvaspoons Vineyard Verdelho (Lodi),"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites.

1264,Bouchaine 2013 Bacchus Collection Estate Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
1265,Brys 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),"Dark-berry aromas meet hints of menthol and game on the nose. The medium-bodied palate follows suit on entry, but becomes lighter by the midpalate from a slick of minerality. Pair alongside gamy meats such as grilled venison loin.",50.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

1284,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team.

The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.",38.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1286,Tamarack Cellars 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead.",50.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1287,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits.

1293,Buty 2010 Columbia Rediviva Phinny Hill Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017.",50.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
1294,Caldwell 2011 Silver Red (Napa Valley),"Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.",120.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
1295,Charles Smith 2012 Stoneridge Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth.

1302,Efeste 2010 Upright Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot.

1305,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Authenticity Red (Paso Robles),"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens.

1347,Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",75.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1356,Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles),"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet.

Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis.

1450,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties.

1462,Castillo De Feliciana 2014 Estate Vineyard Albariño (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh.

1476,The Williamsburg Winery 2015 A Midsummer Night's White White (Virginia),"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end.",16.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1481,Blue Valley 2015 Muskat Ottonel (Middleburg),"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1491,Tie-Dye 2014 Red (North Coast),Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.,15.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1497,Decoy 2013 Red (Sonoma County),"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1502,Oak Knoll 2014 Cloud Rest Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",18.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1509,Cliff Creek 2011 Sams Valley Vineyard Claret (Southern Oregon),"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1510,Del Rio 2013 Claret (Rogue Valley),"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting.",35.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1521,Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon),"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
1522,Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",65.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1523,Qupé 2010 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp.

1528,Cuda Ridge Wines 2008 Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3–5 years.",28.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1531,Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",16.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1533,Melrose 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1535,Qupé 2009 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1536,Qupé 2010 Bien Nacido Cuvée White (Santa Maria Valley),"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp.

1538,Tessa Marie 2009 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1548,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",14.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
1556,Vinum Cellars 2006 Vista Verde Vineyard Viognier (San Benito County),"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors.

1565,Renwood 2006 Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness.

1579,Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",40.0,92,1,0.999695852416706

1584,Mesa Del Sol 2009 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.",29.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
1587,Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",45.0,92,1,0.999695852416706

1601,Silver Thread 2014 Randolph O'Neill Vineyard Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling.

1602,V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley),"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",37.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
1603,Ventosa 2013 Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

1609,Cocobon 2013 Red (California),"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture.

1616,Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",33.0,91,1,0.999695852416706

1669,Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi),"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine.

1676,Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley),"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish.

1680,EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",25.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",85.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1697,Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley),"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!",36.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1702,Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",50.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1703,Dunham 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",28.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1709,Angel Vine 2009 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",22.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
1721,Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate.

1732,Summerwood 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles),"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
1735,Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara),"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",50.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
1742,Cor Cellars 2011 E Cor Si Move Tempranillo 24K Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope),This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol.

1744,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Piocho Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.",32.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
1747,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
1763,Hawks View 2010 Merlot (Washington),"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington.

1768,Dumas Station 2010 Cow Catcher Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak.

1771,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",15.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

1774,SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",32.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
1779,Stephanie 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
1780,Tarara 2010 Nevaeh White (Virginia),"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier.",35.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

1794,Cowhorn 2011 Marsanne-Roussanne (Applegate Valley),"At just 12.6% alcohol, this might seem underripe for warm climate varieties, but it tastes perfectly full and nicely balanced.

1805,Robert Hall 2011 Rhône de Robles Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Counoise, this is bone dry and brisk in acidity, with complex flavors of mineral, herb, sour cherry candy, red currant and white pepper.

1827,Murphy-Goode 2012 HomeFront Red (California),"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.",15.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
1836,Rock Wall 2012 Super Alamedan Red (California),"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines.

1856,Falcone 2008 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015.",25.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
1868,Broman 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers.

1871,Twisted Oak 2007 River of Skulls Dalton Vineyard Red (Calaveras County),"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting Rhône blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1881,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Opulence Syrah (Washington),"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass.",40.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1889,Newsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it.

1892,Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors.

1893,SuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",19.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
1900,Sobon Estate 2006 Cougar Hill Zinfandel (Amador County),"Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture.

1910,Brimstone 2006 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah.

1919,Anthony Nappa 2010 Bordo Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character.

1932,2Plank 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine.",42.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

1942,South Stage 2012 Carmenère (Rogue Valley),"This shows the tannic chewy, vegetal nature of the grape, without off-setting it with other flavors. One-third new French oak has made little impact, and the wine is rough and astringent through a quick finish.",28.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

1963,La Folia Winery 2015 Vermentino (Sierra Foothills),"A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine.

2340,Bontzu 2013 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, thyme, dill and plum aromas are followed by plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that possess a pleasing mouthfeel. The oak is out front at times, especially on the aromas, but the wine is appealing.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2341,Burrell School Vineyards 2011 Honor Roll Estate Reserve Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A mountaintop vineyard in a cool year delivers the expected lighter elegance, offering a complicated and fascinating array of aromas, from incense and white pepper to patchouli and potpourri. The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine.",32.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2342,Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer.",35.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2343,Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills),"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore.",33.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2344,àMaurice 2013 Fred Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2345,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2346,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley),"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.",35.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2347,Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",32.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2353,àMaurice 2010 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2356,Gamache 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rich cherry fruit anchors this excellent, estate-grown Merlot. It's lush and textural, with deep, dark fruit flavors and pleasant roasted notes of coffee and smoke. Half the barrels were new American oak, the rest French, mostly new.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2364,La Clarine Farm 2012 Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.",17.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2370,Barnard Griffin 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years.",17.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2371,Barrister 2009 Bacchus Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",28.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2372,Bougetz 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Lots of muscle in this punchy Sauvignon Blanc, with its ripe lemon, lime, orange and papaya flavors, made bright by crisp acidity. Despite a streak of honey, the finish is dry. Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little Sémillon.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2374,William Church 2010 2 Spires Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer.",34.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2376,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",11.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2382,Alba 2005 Dry Riesling (New Jersey),"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat though—and need more dimension.",13.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
2384,Congress Springs 2006 Viognier (Lodi),"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced.",12.0,82,1,0.999695852416706

2387,Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",55.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
2388,Mazzocco 2005 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",27.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
2390,Emerson 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",13.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
2391,Four Vines 2005 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County),"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness.",24.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
2392,Four Vines 2005 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (California),"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",14.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
2398,J. Rickards 2009 Brown Barn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley),"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2402,Leonesse Cellars 2008 Vista Del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley),"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new.",44.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2405,Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"As before, this is Weinbau vineyard fruit. The 2009 vintage seems to have presented some challenges, as the fruit flavors suggest uneven ripening, with a mix of tutti-fruity candy flavors along with some raisins. Tannins are smooth and there's a pleasing streak of graphite running through the finish. Drink soon.",28.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2406,O•S Winery 2009 The Tusk Elephant Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality.",50.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2407,Owen Roe 2009 Ex Umbris Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later.",24.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2416,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",45.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2417,J. Bookwalter 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs.",55.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2420,Chandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville),"This sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years.

2421,Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",52.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2429,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it.",15.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2430,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Luminesce Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together.",20.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
2438,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",32.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

2449,Signorello 2001 Seta Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2462,J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2475,Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",29.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2481,Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga),"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",70.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2483,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Merlot (California),A soft fruitiness and smooth texture make this medium-bodied red easy to enjoy. Strawberry and cherry notes rest easily on a bed of light tannin that adds an appetizing mouthfeel.,8.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

2505,Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2529,Pazzo 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.",32.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

2542,Plungerhead 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.,20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

2554,Kennedy Shah 2011 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Somewhat lighter in color, this wine has aromas of dried tobacco, coffee, vanilla and purple flowers. The orange peel and cranberry flavors are elegant, backed by soft tannins and citrusy acids.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2555,Kennedy Shah 2012 La Vie en Rouge Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah shows a somewhat uneasy mix of woodspice, green herb and cherry aromas.

2557,Andis 2014 Belle en Rosé (Amador County),"This is Provence pink in color—light and just slightly shaded with copper. It smells floral and fruity, like watermelon, canteloupe and cucumber. The balance is on the sweet side, lending a softness in texture.",18.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2560,Barlow 2012 Unfiltered Merlot (Calistoga),"A 100% varietal wine, this opens in floral violet perfume, delicate notions that are soon overpowered by the chock-a-block blackberry and plum.

2564,Charles & Charles 2014 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of six different varieties with Syrah (72%) in the lead, this pale cherry-color wine pops with aromas of bubble gum, wild strawberry and orange peel.

2570,Bench 2014 Merlot (Knights Valley),"A light, bright version of the variety, this soft and herbaceous wine mixes a subtle richness of toasted oak and dark chocolate with black plum and cherry.

2582,Hawkins Cellars 2015 Barrel Select Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.,24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2590,Ryan Patrick 2013 Reserve Northridge Vineyard Grenache (Wahluke Slope),"This wine is made in a ripe forward style, with lightly volatile aromas of apple, plum and dark raspberries.

2614,V. Sattui 2009 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley),"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now.

2654,Williamson Wines 2006 Clarissa Vin Rouge Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",47.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2656,Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas),"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",8.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2658,La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico),"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2660,La Storia 2006 Cuvee 32 Red (Alexander Valley),"A raw, rustic blend based on Sangiovese and Merlot, this wine is very dry and astringent in tannins. It's an old-fashioned wine that's technically without flaws.",25.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2663,Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada),"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",75.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2664,Sobon Estate 2008 Viognier (Amador County),"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.",16.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2665,Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills),"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",18.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2666,Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia),"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",23.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2667,Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",26.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2668,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",13.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2670,Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",22.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2671,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",32.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2673,Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now.",16.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2684,Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County),"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2695,Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",26.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
2696,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",35.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
2699,Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles),"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
2700,Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",18.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
2708,Murrieta's Well 2013 The Spur Red (Livermore Valley),"An attractive, oaky perfume and melt-in-the-mouth fruit and dark-chocolate flavors make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. It has a luscious, mouth-coating texture, beautifully ripe blackberries and cherries, and a lingering finish.",30.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
2709,Opolo 2014 Summit Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence.",19.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
2712,Rex Hill 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine.",24.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
2713,Robert Biale 2014 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
2725,Krupp Brothers 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.",90.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
2726,Pamplin 2009 Proprietary Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pamplin's admirable focus on its pair of Bordeaux-style blends is rather rare. This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes.",55.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
2728,Forgeron 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A hint of mint can be detected in the opening aromas of this Merlot, which includes a splash of Cabernet Franc in the blend. Licorice, smoke and deep cassis flavors all contribute to an intense, seductive wine, with velvety tannins enrobing a lingering finish.",30.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
2733,Amavi 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is pure single-vineyard Syrah, dark and tasting of cassis and blackberry, with a slightly briny, oyster-shell undercurrent. As it breathes, it displays a cured meat flavor, with a lively, citrusy finish accented by espresso.",34.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2737,Spring Valley Vineyard 2009 Uriah Estate Grown Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds.",50.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2741,Nefarious 2010 Rx-3 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"“Rhône times three” seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2742,DeLille 2011 Chaleur Estate Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon. A cooler vintage has produced a wine of low alcohol and real finesse, with a light dusting of toasty oak. Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6–8 years.",37.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2743,Doyenne 2009 Aix Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Mourvèdre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish.",37.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2747,Turley 2010 Library Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass.",38.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2748,Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is classically proportioned in the warm-climate style. It provides a textbook example of the variety's inky black and purple color, rich, thick tannins and elaborate flavors. These flavors include profoundly ripe summer blackberry and mulberry, smoky, umami-rich bacon and sweet sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, this is a wine to warm the blood on cold winter nights.",35.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
2752,Franciscan 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Oaky toast, cedar and hint of meat add complexity and flavor to this light-bodied, mellowed wine, highlighted by soft, firm tannin and brooding blackberry.",23.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2754,Kestrel 2012 Falcon Series Estate Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This wine offers perfumed aromas of clove, blue fruit, orange peel, toast and wild flowers. The flavors show restraint, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2755,Kestrel 2012 Falcon Series Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of raspberry and herb intermingle on the nose, which also shows a touch of reduction. The palate offers soft tart fruit flavors that provide appeal.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2759,Milbrandt 2015 Traditions Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"Aromas of mineral, flowers and freshly cut green apple are followed by a just off-dry, lightly spritzy palate full of stone-fruit flavors.",13.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2760,Monte Volpe 2013 Sangiovese (Mendocino County),"Light spicy, earthy aromas, tart raspberry and cranberry flavors and a firmly tannic texure add up to a well-structured and rather lean-tasting wine. It makes a good accompaniment to food.",19.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2761,Nine Hats 2015 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are bright, with notes of lime leaf, apricot, citrus peel, flowers and lime. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that provide plenty of pleasure.",14.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2764,Rôtie Cellars 2015 Grenache Blanc (Washington),"This is an up-and-coming variety for the state. High-toned aromas of lime leaf and citrus are followed by a lean, almost faint but still but well-balanced palate with a thread of acidity running through it. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",32.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2765,San Simeon 2015 Stefano Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Warm yellow apple, light custard and white peach combine for a creamy nose on this bottling from the Riboli family's new estate vineyard. The sip starts with a sizzle of acidity and then shows flavors of caramelized green apples and a touch of banana, proving both a tad tart and a tad rich.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2768,Picket Fence 2014 Top Rail Red (Sonoma County),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec is a steal, offering a robust touch of char on the front end aromatically before unleashing bright red fruit and soft tannin. Ultimately light bodied, it retains just the right amount of grippy tannin to give it some bite.",16.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2769,South Stage 2012 Grenache (Rogue Valley),"This powerful wine puts purple plum and tart cherry fruit front and center. That fruit drives the bus through a dense palate, with a burst of acidity adding a turbo charge. It saw 25% new French oak.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2770,Taken Wine Co. 2014 Taken Red (Napa Valley),"This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2771,Terra d'Oro 2014 Barbera (Amador County),"This is an interesting medium-bodied wine from one of the oldest and largest wineries in the foothills. It is not heavy or rich, but has an appetizing dry flavor and firm texture. It will pair well with food since it has good balance.",18.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2775,Analemma 2014 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.",27.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2780,DeLille 2009 Chaleur Estate Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious  and unique.",36.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
2782,Maison Bleue 2009 Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley),"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force.",25.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2783,Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",45.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2786,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.",80.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2790,Trefethen 2007 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",75.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2791,Trefethen 2008 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.",75.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2792,Alexandria Nicole 2008 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Destiny Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.",45.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2793,Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley),"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",125.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2794,Buty 2009 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layering—a berry/rock/tannin layer cake.",40.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2795,McCrea 2006 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.",36.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
2797,Beringer 2008 Alluvium Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Knights Valley),"As always, Beringer's Alluvium blend is a complex white wine, meant to pair with good food. The '08 is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier. It's fruity, crisp and dry.",17.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2799,Hogue 2009 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear.",11.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2802,Cadence 2008 Coda Red (Red Mountain),"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2813,Qupé 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",35.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2814,Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",145.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
2821,Clayhouse 2011 Red Cedar Vineyard Estate Syrah-Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Sweet oak and rich cherry jam combine to make this blend distinctly candied in nature. It's a straightforward, simple with smooth tannins.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2822,Dilecta 2011 The Tiller Caliza Vineyard Russell Family Vineyards Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up.",52.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2832,Vinemark 2010 Touriga Nacional (Paso Robles),"Made from one of Port's best grapes, this wine is sweet and simple. It has sugary raspberry and vanilla flavors, with a sting of heat from high alcohol.",28.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2834,Del Rio 2010 Claret (Rogue Valley),"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this blend of half Merlot along with four other Bordeaux grape varieties brings notes of toast, bittersweet chocolate, citrus and cranberry. It's tart and puckering with tightly wound tannins that need time to resolve.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
2837,Vinemark 2009 Primitivo (Paso Robles),"This wine is medium bodied with spicy, brambly wild berry and tobacco flavors, as well as heady alcohol. It shows some unbalanced green notes. Drink now.",32.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
2838,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2012 Zinfandel (California),"At this price, and with a case production of 110,000, lots of Americans will consider themselves lucky to have a solid red wine like this. It's not terribly complicated, but offers easy flavors of cherries and oak.",8.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
2846,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat.",28.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2847,Murrieta's Well 2004 Meritage (Livermore Valley),"The blend is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The result is a medium-bodied, softly textured red wine with flavors of black cherries, tobacco and vanilla that finishes velvety smooth. Drink now.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2848,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Switchback Red Red (Washington),"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2850,Whitman Cellars 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2852,Helix by Reininger 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through.

2855,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2858,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
2866,Galaxy 2008 Syrah-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Sonoma-Napa),"This is fruity as a pastry, with flavors of nougat, blackberry and cherry jam, toasted almond and honey. Modern in style, the texture is soft, with melted tannins.",85.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

2875,Donati 2008 Ezio Red (Paicines),"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy.",40.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

2883,Iron Horse 2011 Russian Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity.

2886,Now Presenting... 2014 Red (Paso Robles),"This is quite a dynamic and layered wine, especially for the bargain price, with deep and hearty blackberry, caramel, rust, lavender and potpourri on the nose.

2931,Barnard Griffin 2014 Fumé Blanc Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley.

2932,Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher.

2938,Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County),"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine.

2941,Rosenblum 2012 Winemaker Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying.

2943,Hanaiali'i 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak.

It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2949,:Nota Bene 2011 Ciel du Cheval Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins.",40.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
2955,St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley),"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out.

2971,Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",32.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2972,Morrison Lane 2006 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing.",23.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2975,Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2977,X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety.

2979,Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi),"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging.

Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2981,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",34.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2982,Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District),"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah.

2986,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California),"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
2994,Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
3009,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 0 Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry.

Drink now.",16.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

3013,Fulkerson 2012 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake),"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied Grüner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony.",14.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
3024,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish.",14.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
3027,King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate.

3036,Aratás 2011 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County),"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",45.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
3039,Terra d'Oro 2014 Teroldego (Amador County),"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat.

3040,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization.

3044,WillaKenzie Estate 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Blanc,"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Here the clean and fresh flavors of grapefruit, white peach and melon mingle gracefully, with palate-pleasing texture and zippy acidity.",25.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
3047,Avennia 2014 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn.

3049,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Solesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.",65.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
3051,Cadaretta 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled as a Syrah, this drinks more like a GSM, with 11% Mourvèdre, 5% Grenache and 2% Viognier contributing prominently to the blend.

3055,Meyer Family Cellars 2012 Petite Sirah (Yorkville Highlands),"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak.",42.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
3056,Ovum 2015 Memorista Tradition Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment.

3061,Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin.

3094,Bradford Mountain 2012 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.",32.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice.

3108,MooBuzz 2015 G-S-M (Central Coast),"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante.

Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",20.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
3496,Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",37.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
3497,Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon),"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",28.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
3502,Frog's Leap 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",18.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3504,Washington Hills 2008 Riesling (Washington),"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish.",10.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3505,Tagaris 2007 Frank Chiullino Chef Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",55.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3513,Crane Brothers 2006 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now.",36.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3516,Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",34.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3518,Villa San Juliette 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons.",12.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
3538,Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
3540,Rodney Strong 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
3542,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley),"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
3544,Buena Vista 2013 Attila's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate.",38.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
3546,Glen Ellen 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce.",10.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

3551,Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",11.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
3554,Brophy Clark 2009 G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley),"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",13.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
3557,Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",33.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
3561,Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California),"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",18.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
3568,Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley),"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",105.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
3571,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
3576,Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure.

3577,Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",15.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
3581,Longboard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well.

3591,X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
3597,Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",30.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
3598,Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley),"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
3599,Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively.",13.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
3600,Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",16.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
3603,Red Newt Cellars 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyards North Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity.

3605,Silver Thread 2012 Semi-dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine.

3614,Covington 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain),"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors.

3615,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),"Fresh floral and apple notes are showered with zesty lime and lemon on the nose of this bright, invigorating wine.

3626,Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles),"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",58.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
3627,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine.

3665,W.T. Vintners 2012 Damavian Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Like a genie released from the bottle, this wine rises up with aromas of violets, herbs, cranberry and bittersweet chocolate.

4000,Firestone 2014 Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dark red fruit, cracked pepper and the slightest hint of green herbs show on the nose of this pleasant bottling. The herb character is well integrated into a firmly tannic frame on the sip, where tart Montmorency cherry and black-plum skins mix with milk chocolate flavors. The tannins are sticky, yet the mouthfeel is soft in the midpalate.",26.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4004,Cairdeas 2016 Nellie Mae White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of 60% Viognier and 40% Roussanne bursts with honeysuckle, jasmine, pear and ripe peach aromas. The flavors are broad and fleshy, with a slightly sharp finish that shows some warmth.",24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4006,RoxyAnn 2009 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),"Light and slightly spicy, this spent 15 months in one-third new French and American oak barrels, yet it comes across as a bit mild and one dimensional.",30.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4014,Clos du Lac 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Amador County),"Opening with a bouquet of dried apricot and almond paste, this is a full style of Sauvignon Blanc, with tons of lemon on the finish. Pair this with seafood.",10.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4016,Decoy 2010 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Sweet and direct, this has blackberry, cherry jam, mocha and spicy sandalwood flavors. There's plenty of charm, but not much complexity. Drink now.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4017,Decoy 2010 Red (Napa Valley),"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot has some oak flavors on top of the jammy blackberries and cherries. It's simple and direct; ideal for drinking now.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4018,Eleanor 2009 Red (California),"This expensive wine is softly tannic, earthy and fruity, with dried herb and raspberry tea flavors. From Francis Ford Coppola.",48.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4024,Provenance Vineyards 2011 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Nice and crisp in acidity, with a brisk, clean mouthfeel, this houses citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It seems a little sweet, so don't expect anything too dry.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4027,Robledo 2011 Seven Brothers Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"This is a slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc that's shy on the nose, without much depth or breadth.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4028,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Ethos Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are exuberant, with appealing notes of apricot, pineapple, honey, white flowers and citrus. The citrus and tropical-fruit flavors are rich yet elegant, topped by a lengthy finish.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4031,Basel Cellars 2012 Estate Inspired Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of herb, cherry, cigar box, vanilla and baking spice are followed by coffee and cherry flavors that display a pleasing sense of balance, with espresso notes lingering on the finish.",46.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4035,Cayuse 2014 Cailloux Vineyard Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is an aromatic wine, with vibrant yet still subtle notes of flowers, peach, citrus, lemon curd and wet stone.

4037,Aluvé 2012 Primo Volo Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (80%), Malbec (12%) and Merlot. The aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of poblano, herb, spice, vanilla and cherry. The palate displays a mixture of fruit and barrel, with tightly wound tannins and bright acidity heightening the interest.",48.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4043,Robert Renzoni 2013 Sonata Red (Temecula Valley),"This is an exciting and promising blend for the winery and region. Cabernet Sauvignon and the Brunello clone of Sangiovese present aromas of pine wood, wet slate, mud, dark red cherries and tobacco smudge. Elderberry, juniper and cedar show on the woody palate that combines great acidity with firm structure.",42.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4046,Solminer 2015 Honea Vineyard Muskat (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bright orange blossoms, tangy lime, fresh rain, quince, green tea, jasmine and even a sesame element shine through on the nose of this bottling that carries a distinctively Asian character. Exotic citrus and brisk melon flavors show on the palate, which is lined with an ethereal undercurrent of bound up, bone-dry energy.",28.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4051,JM Cellars 2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine brings aromas of iron and huckleberry pie. The blueberry and earth flavors are quite ripe, lingering on the finish.",48.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4056,Limerick Lane 2013 Rocky Knoll Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This wine is insanely good, from a dry-farmed, yes, rocky outcropping of vines planted first in 1910, then again in 1934 and the 1970s, with Carignane and Petite Sirah in the mix. It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently.",50.0,97,1,0.999695852416706
4070,Carlisle 2014 Saitone Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"The appellation famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay packs a powerfully pretty punch when it comes to this variety, too, showing in this wine a soft, focused layering of Luxardo maraschino cherry and touch of cranberry. It then reveals an underlying richness that rewards the patient with a splash of white and black pepper, leaving an indelible stamp on the palate. Drink now through 2024.",47.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
4081,Wood Family Vineyards 2010 Muy Bueno Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue.",32.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4082,Kaleidos 2008 Osiris Red (Paso Robles),"This blend is based on Grenache. It has white sugar, raspberry, caramel and spice flavors that finish as luscious as a candy bar.",32.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4083,Kenneth Volk 2010 Pomar Junction Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Paso Robles),"This variety is one of the traditional Port grapes. It should do well as a dry wine in the hotter areas of California, but no one has figured out how to make it happen. This bottling by Kenneth Voik does not advance the cause. The wine is heavy and dull.",36.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4089,Pedroncelli 2012 friends.white White (Sonoma County),"Soft, rich and simple, with flavors of lemondrop candy and vanilla.",12.0,82,1,0.999695852416706

4093,Amador Cellars 2006 Westside Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness.",25.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
4094,Green Truck 2010 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Made from organic grapes, Green Truck's Petite has not a lot going on aromatically and exhibits very little in the way of the variety's profile, tasting like generic red wine.",14.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
4095,Brochelle Vineyards 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Way too ripe, with the flavors veering into raisins. The alcohol, which is 15.6% abv, really sticks out.",32.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
4100,Green Truck 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"A Lake County SB with very little in the way of aromatics. It's acceptable for everyday, but a generic white wine.",14.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
4112,Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Syrah (Santa Clara Valley),"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note.",29.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4114,Loft 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California),This wine smells mildly herbaceous and tastes sufficiently ripe and round to make it attractive to sip.,25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4122,Beacon Hill 2015 Riesling,"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4128,South Stage 2010 Alchemy Red (Rogue Valley),"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4133,Qupé 2008 Syrah (Central Coast),"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4134,Ridge 2008 York Creek Zinfandel (California),"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4135,Sanguis 2006 Waxing Poetic Syrah (California),"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. The actual Syrah itself is clean and pure in ripe blackberry jam. Might do something over the years, but probably best now, with a decant.",75.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4142,Arrowood 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors. It's a bit one-dimensional, but appeals for its fresh acids and richness.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4143,Atwater 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",16.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4144,Atwater 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.",17.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4145,Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California),"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",38.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4152,Dierberg 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.",32.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4157,Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Riesling (Seneca Lake),"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone. Dry, but with a touch of white peach sweetness, refreshing lime juice flavors and a high toned acidity keep this wine refreshing and brisk.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4158,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2008 Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Dry and refreshing with clean, pure notes of white peach, orange blossoms and petrol on the nose and palate, this shows off Riesling's pristine side. A splash of tart, underripe starfruit and fresh limes on the palate combine with a brisk acidity and wet stone minerality, giving this wine an invigorating feel.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4162,No Girls 2014 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",75.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4165,Sheldon 2016 Springloaded Monkey Paw Luc's Vineyard Tempranillo (Sonoma County),"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",41.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4177,Elyse 2012 York Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (Spring Mountain District),"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.",37.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4182,Carlisle 2015 Limerick Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold.",47.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4183,Carlisle 2015 Papa's Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.",44.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4184,Carlisle 2015 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Big and juicy, this wine draws on a few sources as well as 15% Petite Sirah to offer a complex and layered expression of black cherry, cardamom and chocolate. Rich from start to finish, it satisfies as it calls out for smoky meat.",37.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4193,Klinker Brick 2007 Farráh Syrah (Lodi),"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4194,Tildio 2006 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"A proven success for Tildio, the newest release of Cabernet Franc uses fruit from the exceptional RiverBend vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. It's a delicious mix of wild berry and smoky earth, with dark streaks of licorice and tar adding depth and persistence.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4196,Point & Line 2014 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4198,Sequoia Grove 2012 Cambium Red (Napa Valley),"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Dry tannins provide a leathery texture atop piquant sensibilities of cedar, pencil and chocolate-specked blackberry jam. Structured and full bodied, it'll benefit from further cellaring. Drink now through 2022.",115.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4199,Skinner 2013 Mourvèdre (El Dorado),"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019.",26.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4205,King Estate 2014 Antiquum Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality.",24.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4206,Kokomo 2015 Grenache Rosé (North Coast),"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",18.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4208,Lang & Reed 2013 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones. Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine.",48.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4215,Pear Valley 2013 Distraction Red (Paso Robles),"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4216,Renwood 2013 Riker Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"This wine has jazzy, jammy aromas and ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors, wrapping them in a warm layer of fine-grained tannins and a nice dash of sweet baking spices from aging in oak.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4220,Stoller 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Dundee Hills),"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4241,Rodney Strong 2014 Rosé of Malbec (Sonoma County),"This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years. Dark pink-red, it is medium bodied and refreshing, with notes of cherry, blueberry and vanilla.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4250,Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley),"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed. Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4257,Chateau Ste. Michelle 1997 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",23.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4258,Canoe Ridge 1999 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington),"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy.",12.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4260,Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4262,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",20.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4263,Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",23.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4264,Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California),"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4267,Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",19.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4268,Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4269,Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley),"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4270,Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4277,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4278,Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros),"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",35.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4279,Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
4280,Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",16.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4282,Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",15.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4287,Kale 2009 Alder Springs Vineyard Spirit Rock Syrah (Mendocino County),"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides.",40.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4290,Coeur d'Alene 2012 Viognier (Washington),"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4307,Bella Ragazza 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price.",9.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4308,Vinum 2010 White Elephant White (California),"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",17.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4319,Bogle 2010 Riesling (California),"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",10.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4327,LaVelle 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,18.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4335,Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4337,Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",15.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4338,Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",15.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4340,Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley),"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",24.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4341,Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",35.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4342,Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville),"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",40.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4343,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4344,Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4345,Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",9.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4346,Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",30.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4347,Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",24.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4348,Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley),"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",22.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4349,Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4350,Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4351,Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",20.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
4352,Pear Valley 2014 Pear Valley Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling. The palate is nicely creamy but not overly thick, with banana cream and pear-mousse flavors that grow increasingly tropical as the sip lingers.",21.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4360,Amity 2013 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This pure varietal wine conjures up apple and pear juice, finished dry and crisply defined. There is no particular nuance to it, but it's well made and quite quaffable.",22.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4375,Hearst Ranch 2013 Lone Tree Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"Made in a thick, oaky style, this shows burned caramel, fudge and hints of dried mint and oregano on the nose. The palate is rich with blueberry and dark chocolate, wrapped in a veil of oak smoke, with chunky, chewy tannins and a purple-flower nuance.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4378,Kunde 2013 Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry. A streak of pencil lead and fig provides further intrigue and complexity around a full-bodied elegance.",50.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4380,Gershon Bachus 2008 Aeolus Estate Red (Temecula),"Very deep black plum, smashed red berries, concentrated cola and coffee liqueur aromas entice the nose on this blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 40% Zinfandel and 20% Grenache. It's very spicy and lively on the palate with an almost biting, explosive acidity. Flavors of espresso and deep red fruits are noticeable.",50.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4382,Melrose 2012 Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),"Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.",26.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4384,Oak Knoll 2013 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Veteran producer Oak Knoll remains one of Oregon's most underrated value wineries. This full-bodied, super-fruity Riesling offers bright, off-dry, well-balanced flavors of citrus, honey and tea.",10.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4399,William Hill Estate 2013 Coastal Collection Merlot (Central Coast),"Fresh red cherries, strawberries and cranberry greet the nose on this widely available wine that also shows mocha and charred chaparral. The palate is lively and also boasts some decent tannins, offering flavors of plum and pomegranate juice, crushed marjoram and licorice.",17.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4400,Verse & Chorus 2012 Mat Kearney Red (Napa Valley),"Milk chocolate and dark plum combine to nice effect in this majority-Merlot, blended with almost 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, savory and spicy in cinnamon and clove, the wine is substantially dense and thick on the palate.",22.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4405,Naggiar 2010 Estate Grown Reserve Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4406,Philo Ridge 2012 Firebrick Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Full flavored and full bodied, this big, expansive wine oozes ripe and dried fruit character from the aroma to the flavors and finish. It suggests blackberry and strawberry flavors, feels tannic on the palate rather than soft, and carries a bit of warmth.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4408,Kokomo 2013 Timber Crest Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Smoky red and black berry wrap themselves around a full-bodied expression of fruit and introverted oak, managing to provide texture and body through a foundation of well-managed acidity. With a grippiness on the finish, the wine offers velvety power and finesse.",36.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4409,Lovingston 2012 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs. Amazingly, this plush wine maintains excellent acidic verve, which carries along the entire medley of flavors to a persistent fruit-laden finish. Drink now for utter enjoyment.",20.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4410,Lynch Wines 2012 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019.",21.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4411,MacLaren 2012 Atoosa's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The winery's coolest, lightest Syrah, this is an elegant, ethereal wine, sanguine and gamy with an abundance of white pepper and blueberry. Complex, it takes on a thick middle before finishing lean and soft.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4425,Quady North 2010 Vinum Pro Virtus Arsenal Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Applegate Valley),"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4426,Rudius 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit. The smoke and savory flavors are soft and reserved in style, showing a pleasing persistence on the finish.",58.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4429,Treos 2014 Albariño (Willamette Valley),"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4438,Milbrandt 2008 The Estates Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner.",25.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4440,Naggiar 2009 Estate grown Viognier (Sierra Foothills),"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose. Its fruitiness is restrained somewhat and would stand out paired with a crème brûlée—though on its own, the alcohol is overpowering.",28.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4441,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Syrah (Paso Robles),"Defines a certain style of Paso Robles red wine, soft in structure, with easy, gentle tannins and ripe, pronounced fruit that's almost candied in sweetness. But in this case, the blackberry and cherry flavors are totally dry.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4442,Ott & Murphy 2008 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light strawberry fruit is matched to barrel notes of cola and caramel. There is more than a trace of barnyard and earth, and the tannins have a tea-like astringency. The fruit seems a bit over-matched.",16.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4445,Red Truck 2009 Pink Truck Rosé (California),"Hard to say if this is a dessert wine or a rosé, because it's fairly sweet. Let's call it a rosé. And a pretty one it is, with savory orange, raspberry and vanilla flavors, balanced with acidity.",9.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4446,Rock Wall 2009 Monte Rosso Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Hot and scoury in high alcohol, and that burn is accented by Zin's powerhouse tingly spices. The flavors are extracted and sweet in raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate. Enjoy this rugged Zin with barbecue and roasts.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4450,Trust 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity. The wine is sound and balanced, but not showing its best at the moment.",28.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4455,Dancing Derby 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A good, off-dry useful wine for drinking across the board with a wide variety of fare, or by itself as a cocktail. It's brisk and clean, with pleasant citrus, apricot, spice and vanilla flavors.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4456,De Loach 2009 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4460,Écluse 2010 Ensemble Lock Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",42.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4476,Transcendence 2010 La Paloma Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon.",28.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4479,Bonair 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%.",13.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4486,Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley),"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",35.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4495,Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",50.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4498,Barrister 2006 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah. Violets and chocolate dominate, with wild herb and cured meat flavors through the midpalate. Tannins are chewy and textured, with some stem and bark flavors.",23.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4500,Cadaretta 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",33.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4502,Chatter Creek 2006 Blend 105 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy, and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out, and as it does, the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast.",22.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4504,K Vintners 2009 The Creator Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is co-fermented Old Stones Vineyard and Cailloux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Syrah (40%), showing the funk of the terroir and less of the varietal character of the fruit. It's flavorful and textural, with earth, anise and smoke notes, plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length.",55.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
4505,Pirouette 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this packs 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Refined and elegant, it is precisely structured, with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense, deep and compact, suggesting long aging ahead.",50.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
4507,Dunham 2010 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.",20.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
4508,Betz Family 2010 La Côte Patriarche Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character, with a mix of blue and purple berry, a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense. Subtle and expressive, this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche.",55.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4509,Constant 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"One of the best Napa Cabernet Francs in memory, this shows lush, concentrated flavors of cherry pie, red currant, mocha, anise and smoky, spicy sandalwood that are wrapped into firm but exceptionally refined tannins. Drink now to experience the youthful beauty.",130.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4513,K Vintners 2009 En Cerise Ovide Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes. Arguably, one gets better aromatics than Charles Smith, and the wine flavors deliver on their initial promise.",65.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4514,K Vintners 2009 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.",60.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4519,Gramercy 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness, wrapped around stiff, tight, rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance, earthiness and herbal details.",55.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
4526,Sineann 2012 Champoux Vineyard Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.",36.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4533,Elyse 2012 L'Ingenue Naggiar Vineyard White (Sierra Foothills),"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4534,FEL 2013 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4550,Robert Biale 2012 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4552,Savage Grace 2013 Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills),"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.",27.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4555,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",21.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4560,Berryessa Gap 2013 Iberian Series Verdelho (Yolo County),"Almost like a salad in your glass, this fresh-tasting, dry white wine smells like sugar snap peas and just-picked greens. It tastes snappy and crisp with parsley and thyme flavors, and has a refreshing texture.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4564,The Infinite Monkey Theorem 2012 The Hundreth Monkey Red (Grand Valley),"Plush and mouthfilling, this blend of Petit Sirah, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Tinta Cão comes with notes of wild berries, cedar, flowers and spiced cocoa. Dusty, tongue-coating tannins keep the palate grounded.",50.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4570,Coeur de Terre 2013 Rustique Rosé (Willamette Valley),"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4574,Fabbioli Cellars 2011 Tannat (Virginia),"An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine.",45.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4579,Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",24.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4580,Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Meritage (Central Coast),"Nice and dry, with some smooth tannins framing berry, cherry and oak flavors. Serve it at big parties, at the beach, wherever. Nobody will complain.",11.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4581,SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",32.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4586,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",15.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4591,Baehner Fournier 2012 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't fully ripe yet it's dry and crisp, with a mouthwatering cleanness. There's an edge to the Meyer lemon, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4594,Castillo De Feliciana 2012 Albariño (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In Spain, Albariño is usually a steely, bone dry, sea-inflected white wine. Here it is made in an off-dry style, with 10 g/L residual sugar. The sweetness masks any apparent varietal specificity, resulting in a pleasant, but generic white wine.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4595,Communication Block 2010 Lampyridae Vineyards Red (Mount Veeder),"The winery doesn't tell us what the blend is, but it tastes vaguely Rhônish. It's dry, velvety and forward in cherry pie, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little hot in alcohol. Drink up.",50.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4599,Martin & Weyrich 2011 Allegro Moscato (California),"This straddles the border between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. It's crisp in acidity, with candied orange, golden apricot and honey flavors. You could certainly drink it with cookies and fruits, but it's just dry enough to stand up to squash baked with brown sugar, and a piece of grilled chicken.",12.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4602,Robert Mondavi 2012 Private Selection Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),"Pinot Grigios like this helped make the variety one of America's most popular wines. While it's basically dry and crisp in acidity, it offers jammy green apple, lemon and lime Lifesaver candy and vanilla notes that appeal to consumers.",11.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4609,Lynch Wines 2013 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances.",25.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4610,Armida 2014 Tina's Block Maple Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak. The tannin structure is sizable, while the wine is full of leather, cigar box and black pepper accents that weave within the ripe fruit.",48.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4615,Haraszthy 2013 Indian Springs Ranch Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This sultry, big-boned wine offers deft aspects of black pepper and dried herb atop a softly layered touch of brown sugar. Richness is there, as is a voluptuous flirtatiousness, yet it remains dry and dusty on the palate and classically varietal.",34.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4621,Freakshow 2014 Red (Lodi),"Dark, dense with fruit flavor and thickly tannic, this full-bodied wine is a monument to concentration, ripeness and richness. Massive tannins are matched by huge jammy fruit, with a sense of layering and depth that is impressive and satisfying to experience.",20.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4622,Gård 2014 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Syrah (68%), Grenache (29%) and Viognier, this wine brings pungent, directly appealing aromas of smoked meat, blue fruit, black olive, orange peel and high-toned flowers. The blue and black-fruit and smoked-meat flavors are silky and well constructed with a finish that lingers.",35.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4625,Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island),"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.",24.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4629,Baker & Brain 2013 Pendulum Red (Monterey County),"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.",35.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4630,Ballentine 2014 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.",35.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4633,Cana's Feast 1999 Red (Red Mountain),"This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot is young, rambunctious and tight, but also very interesting. The aromas of chocolate, clove, pepper and black plum do the trick: you are drawn in. Intense flavors of cherry, plum, cassis and pepper, and a finish of piquant spices and oak are equally satisfying. Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.",30.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4637,Abacela 2006 Claret (Southern Oregon),"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",32.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4638,Babcock 2009 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sta. Rita Hills),"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4646,Evergreen Vineyards 2008 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"A solid, straightforward, all-purpose Pinot Gris, this offers firm and spicy pear and apple fruit, some crisp phenolics giving it a racy edge, and a little bite to the back of the palate. It has the acidity to stand up to creamy pasta sauces or soft cheeses.",17.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4647,Fess Parker 2007 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",45.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4648,J. Scott Cellars 2007 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping.",23.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4654,Wagner 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This is a gorgeously perfumed Riesling, chock-full of white flowers and ripe, juicy stonefruit, but not at all cloying. Dry on the palate, it exhibits elegant peach and apricot flavors that lead to a long, lingering finish marked by lime peel and a hint of chalk.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4655,Abacela 2008 Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley),"Harvested at 22.6 degrees brix, this bright and spicy Dolcetto does not reach too far. It's tart, with fruit flavors that suggest wild berries and pomegranate, and tannins that are firm but never green. A fine quaffing wine.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4658,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Necessity Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",24.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4679,Margerum 2012 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County),"This early peek at Margerum's 2012 Rhône-style red wines holds the promise of future great releases from the acclaimed vintage. The wine, a blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Counoise, is enormous in ripe red cherries, red currants, cola and oak flavors, and while the acidity is fine, it's soft enough to drink now.",27.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4685,Raymond 2010 Small Lot Collection Syrah (Napa Valley),"Raymond brings their expert Cabernet touch to this Syrah. It has the rich, balanced tannins you expect from a Napa red wine, along with oodles of juicy blackberries, blueberries and cherries. But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah.",45.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
4690,Gary Farrell 2012 Maffei Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"From a vineyard holding in the midst of prime Pinot Noir country, Maffei intrigues in ripe, hearty plum, black cherry and kir aromas and flavors.

4702,Lancaster 2013 Samantha's Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Flinty and austere, this is an elegant white wine crafted from 100% Musque clone, dancing in pear and grapefruit. The layered texture impressively stands out, riding the wave between creamy and lemony crisp with precision, opening the door for the wine to finish refreshingly.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4711,Michael Gill Cellars 2012 Tantrum Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"This is a very approachable and tasty wine, especially for a grape that can be so tannic when young. Aromas of cola, chopped mint and cherries translate to a fruity and minty palate, with just enough tannins, a nice acidic spice and a bit of woodiness on the finish. It's very well measured.",42.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
4716,Fidelity 2013 Railyard Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A small-production blend of 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, this was aged over a year in a small percentage of new oak. Dry and structured, it's a celebration of chocolate, leather and blackberry, the fruit sizably ripe yet kept in check. Drink now through 2018.",16.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4723,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 Crown Block Red (Livermore Valley),"Generous aromas like ripe berries and vanilla get this full-bodied wine off to a good start.Next, the flavors chime in with harmonious blackberry, black cherry and baking-spice notes. The texture is suave and nicely tannic, and a tasty, spicy effect lasts on the finish. The wine is made with 46% Merlot, plus Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.",45.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4724,DeLille 2013 D2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is principally Merlot (57%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) along with pinches of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dark fruit, fresh herb and abundant barrel-spice aromas are followed by bountiful, restrained black-fruit flavors that carry through the finish.",45.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
4738,K Vintners 2012 The Deal Sundance Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Aromas of blackberry, black currant, cinnamon and dark plum lead to high toned herbal, green olive, licorice and barrel spice grace notes.

4740,Shining Hill 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though sourced principally from Red Mountain grapes, where the Col Solare winery is located, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux-style blend is simply labeled Columbia Valley.

4746,Wellington 2009 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"With a sensual mouthfeel, but firm tannins, this is just what you want a Merlot to be. The cherry, red currant, violet and mocha flavors are complex and easy to drink now, especially with a great steak. At the age of four-plus years, it's soft and mellow.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4747,David Girard 2012 Estate Vineyard Grenache Blanc (El Dorado),"Floral notes, as well as hints of lemon, pear and pineapple introduce this high-acid white.

4757,Damiani 2010 Meritage (Finger Lakes),"Toast and spice notes add warmth to crisp blackberry and cassis on this elegantly composed Meritage.

4761,Lakewood 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A wish of smoke adds complexity and mystery to bright tangerine, white peach and floral notes on this dry-style Riesling. It's delicate in body, but vibrantly structured, with tart lemon-lime acidity that pierces through ripe stone-fruit flavors on the palate.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4764,Vie Winery 2010 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Blackberry and blueberry jam and sweet oak flavors mark this young Syrah. It's dry, tannic and juicy, but a little soft in acidity. Drink it now and over the next few years.",45.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

Vintners 2010 Gorgeous Syrah Destiny Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Fermented with 30% whole clusters and aged 20 months in neutral French oak, this is a distinctive wine with notes reminiscent of sage along with white pepper, violets and a tinge of copper.

4772,McCay Cellars 2008 Paisley Red (Lodi),"McCay is a producer to watch in Lodi and this wine is a perfect example of why.

4774,Peachy Canyon 2010 Vortex Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Made in the Peachy Canyon style, this Zin, which contains some Petite Sirah, is very high in alcohol. It's sweet, hot and soft.

4780,Steppe Cellars 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish. Yet there is a substantial and well-built wine here, waiting to resolve its components into a more seamless whole. Retasted after being open a full day, it showed well, suggesting good aging potential.",28.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

4805,Miraflores 2009 Methode Ancienne Syrah (El Dorado),"At first this comes across as being a bit heavy, yeasty and tight. With time, however, this should be full of bramble-fruit flavors. This is a well-crafted wine, with structure and elegance that should start to show in 3–5 years.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
4808,Tertulia 2008 Sobra Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a fresh and forward effort that's based on all six Bordeaux grapes. It bears pretty plum and cherry flavors, with a chocolaty wash over the quick finish.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

4830,Waterstone 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A waft of Nilla Wafer opens the bouquet of this light, well-composed wine, followed by fruity notes of lemon and orange, a floral component at its core.

4858,Arizona Stronghold 2011 Site Archive Norte Malvasia (Cochise County),"Effusive aromas of lychee, lemon drop and orange blossom mark the nose of this Malvasia.

4863,Tarara 2012 Viognier (Virginia),"Tropical in scent, this is an easygoing, medium-bodied wine that is laced with bright acids. Baked cod doused with lime would make a solid pairing.",20.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

4868,Kokomo 2011 Claret (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripeness was no problem in this wine, despite the chilly vintage. It bursts with raspberries and cherries, with brown sugar and oak richness.

4881,Fenestra 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"This wine has a bright cherry character in the aromas and flavors along with medium body and a dry, firm texture. Lighter than many of its peers, but still cloaked in lots of fine tannins, it will improve with time. Wait until 2020.",28.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4888,Troon 2013 Blue Label Zinfandel (Applegate Valley),"This sports a blue label, to differentiate it from the winery's estate bottling. It's dark and toasty, with robust black-cherry fruit, along with strong notes of charcoal, espresso and vanilla. There's nothing subtle here, but should work well with Korean ribs.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4892,Z. Alexander Brown 2013 Uncaged Red (North Coast),"Wonderful blackberry and ripe grape flavors fill up this big but smooth new wine under country-music star Zac Brown's label.

4902,McFadden 2009 Gewürztraminer (Potter Valley),"Pungently perfumed, all lemon, mandarin orange and spice, this Gewürztraminer is moderately textured and aromatically pretty, an interesting companion to spicy food but also the myriad of flavors found around a holiday meal.",16.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4903,Morgan 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"A welcome return to form for Morgan's Sauvignon Blanc, after a few disappointing vintages.

4908,Gary Farrell 2009 Bradford Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Very ripe and spicy, with a sprinkle of dusty Christmas spices tanging up the wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. Zin doesn't get much richer, but this one could be a little firmer in structure. Drink now.",45.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4909,Virage 2010 Rosé (Napa Valley),"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries. Try this easy-drinking wine with grilled tuna or a hamburger.",24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
4913,Annefield Vineyards 2009 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"This Virginia Cab Franc starts soft and ripe with loads of juicy black currant and berry flavors flecked with sweet, warm baking spices and cedar notes.

4917,Ludwig 2010 Hammerklavier McIntyre Vineyard Pinot Noir-Dornfelder Red (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Tastes rich and forward, with cherry pie, blueberry and sandalwood flavors. The color is dark, and the wine is a little too soft, as well as hot in alcohol. Drink up.",28.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4921,Passion Vineyards 2009 Mango's Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Mango, presumably, is the dog pictured on the label. This is a heavily-extracted, somewhat bitter Merlot, with fruit flavors of blackberry syrup, alcohol at 15%, and still a fair amount of green bitterness to the tannins. Notes of iodine and anise come into play in the finish.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
4923,Pure Cru 2010 Purety White (Napa Valley),"Blended almost equally with Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, and aged in French oak, this white Bordeaux-style wine has plenty to like.

4931,Wy'East Vineyards 2012 Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is a lightly aromatic Gris with red apple and apple blossom.

4947,Duckhorn 2009 The Discussion Red (Napa Valley),"Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.",125.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
4961,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light.",10.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
4972,Ripken 2011 Under the Sea Primitivo (Lodi),"Earthy, vegetal aromas and equally earthy, peppery flavors make this wine unusually rustic. It does have traces of good aged character, like leather and tea.",22.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4980,Insomnia 2013 Pinot Grigio (California),"This medium-bodied wine has very subtle aromas and flavors, a fairly smooth texture, and an ever-so-slightly buttery accent. It offers a slim personality to enjoy.",11.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4982,Scratchpad 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"This is a very watery, almost scentless wine, with hints of golden apples on the nose. The palate is also lacking, showing slight pears and nectarines. The DIY label is a cute gimmick though.",13.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
4990,Novy 2010 Oley Late Harvest Sweet Viognier (Russian River Valley),"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity.

4991,Novy 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Sonoma Mountain),"Virtually identical with Pinot Noir, and quite a good one at that.

5005,McCay Cellars 2008 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",28.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5007,Novy 2008 Judge Family Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Novy's Syrahs have really hit their stride lately.

5012,Longboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley),"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5021,Rosenblum 2005 Rominger Vineyard Syrah (Yolo County),"It's pure Rosenblum, as sweet as a confection, as delicious as a filling made from blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla and white sugar.

5026,Kestrel 2004 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
5029,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Sangiovese (Red Mountain),"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",25.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
5033,Madrigal 2010 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino),"From this longstanding grape grower and Napa-based producer is a Mendocino-sourced Gewürztraminer that's beautifully gold in color and full of pretty tropical aromas.

5042,"Salvatore Principe 2009 Take Flight, Artists Collection Limited Edition Zinfandel (Lodi)","For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi.

5051,Hermann J. Wiemer 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"There's a gorgeous sheen of minerality that glimmers from start to finish on this vervy but honey-kissed off-dry Riesling.

5059,Karly 2006 Buck's Ten Point Zinfandel (Amador County),"With its briary flavors of fresh-picked mountain berries and exotic clove, nutmeg and pepper spices, this Zin defines a more elegant Foothills approach to the variety.

5064,Nickel & Nickel 2005 Suscol Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",55.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5066,Gary Farrell 2007 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture.

5067,Karly 2005 Sadie Upton Zinfandel (Amador County),"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",29.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5071,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Pousseur Syrah (Central Coast),"Here's a bone-dry, powerful young Syrah that's packed with hard tannins. The vineyard sourcing is interesting, ranging from the Sierra Foothills through Paso Robles and the Salinas Valley to the Santa Cruz Mountains. Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5072,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling.

5084,Broken Earth 2015 Verdelho (Paso Robles),"There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose. The palate shows more layers, starting with ripe peach and then firming up on citrus pith, sour apple and tangy pear. A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
5088,Cougar 2015 Falanghina (Temecula Valley),"Finding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula.

5106,Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
5108,Milbrandt 2009 Traditions Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity.

5114,Kunde 2008 Viognier (Sonoma Valley),"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes.

5143,Brooklyn West 2012 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"Sharp lime skins, rich petrol and yellow grapefruit juice combine for that familiarly fresh Riesling aroma, yet this one is a tad richer, with a lemon pastry note.

A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months.

5573,Grande River 2011 Malbec (Grand Valley),Strawberry and blackberry jam aromas are inflected with dried herb aromas of thyme and basil. The jammy palate has just enough structure from acid and tannin to keep it alive.,20.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
5575,Lyeth 2012 Malbec (California),"A streak of savory flavors, like sage and soy, runs through this otherwise grapy, plummy, medium-bodied wine, giving it a unique profile. Firmly tannic in texture, and showing a bit of the typical spiciness, it's ready to drink.",13.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

5587,Weisinger 2012 Meadowlark Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Like its companion Syrah from Cedar Ridge Vineyard fruit, this is pure varietal and spent 18 months in American oak.

5604,Consilience 2012 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Seemingly effervescent aromas of lemon-lime soda, wet chalk, baking soda and apple blossom make for a very showy yet mineral-driven nose.

5610,Donkey & Goat 2013 Grenache (El Dorado),"This nervy and vibrant wine takes time to reveal the intriguing flavors within. Quite tart and tannic at first, it is firm in texture to balance the ripe, sweet plum, marascino cherry and orange peel aromas. While chewy and lip-smacking in the beginning, deeper flavors come through on the second and third sips, and a smoky nuance develops on the finish.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

5634,Sirius 2010 Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Black and viscous, this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way.

5639,Captûre 2010 Harmonie Red (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.",120.0,94,1,0.999695852416706

5655,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2011 Sin Zin Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"This simple wine gets the basic Zin concept across, offering briary cherry, red currant, spice and oak flavors.

A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish.",60.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
5697,Noble Vines 2016 152 Pinot Grigio (San Bernabe),"Another clean and tasty bottling from this label's numbered series, this shows light nectarine and lemon aromas on the nose.

5708,Trisaetum 2014 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Finished off dry, this masks its residual sugar with ample acidity.

5709,Valdez 2012 St. Peter's Church Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"This classic site provides a grippy, structured experience of juicy, leathery blackberry and black pepper. The wine also reveals a brighter, more vibrant underside of red berry, perhaps from the contribution of 5% Grenache into the mix, alongside 17% Petite Sirah.

5789,Sleight of Hand 2010 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso.

The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits.

5808,Alpha Omega 2009 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab.

5844,Mount Pleasant Winery 2007 Bethlehem Valley Norton (Missouri),"Notes of spiced toast, Raisinets, hickory and prune mingle on the smoky, slightly baked nose. The flavors are concentrated and intense, but the baked quality is a little too distracting.",25.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
5847,Vivác Winery 2009 Montepulciano (New Mexico),"The spiced dark-cherry and blackberry aromas come with a rusty edge, leading to a palate that's marked by vivid acids and trifling tannic support.

5849,Three Fox 2010 La Boheme Viognier (Virginia),"Smelling grapey on the nose, this has additional notes of white currant, toast and white stone fruit.

5850,Truro 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Southeastern New England),"The acidity is the prominent attribute of this wine, jutting out with little flesh to buffer its cut.

5860,Debonné 2009 Cabernet Franc (Grand River Valley),"Chewy tannins and tart acids buttress the midpalate's broad berry flavor.

Tart berries and toasty oak show on the palate, yet mild tannins offer little structure. The finish is long and tart.",34.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6246,Belle Ambiance 2016 Pinot Grigio (California),"Apple, melon and a touch of vanilla give a tasty spectrum of aromas and flavors to this medium-bodied wine. It's light enough to sip easily but has a bit of depth to the flavors that makes it interesting.",10.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6260,Brander 2012 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Cigar box and very ripe strawberry dominate the aromatic profile, though a bit of bell pepper lingers in the background. It's light and racy on the palate, with cherry cola, cedar and mellow tannins, making for a very fresh and fun wine, best served after mild chilling.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6261,Haka by Labyrinth 2010 Freebird Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6265,Naggiar 2010 Don Giovanni Estate Grown Red (Sierra Foothills),"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017. It is deeply colored, full bodied and a bit sandy in texture, yet that grip seems O.K. in this wine, balanced by the ripe fruit flavors.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6274,Wise Villa 2012 Estate Grown and Produced Touriga Nacional (Sierra Foothills),"This well-balanced red made from a variety used in Port wines grows on you with each sip. It has bright cherry and raspberry aromas, exotic floral flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and medium body. It should be versatile with food.",34.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6282,Columbia Winery 2013 Grenache Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine is electric pink in color, with notes of strawberry bubblegum and cranberry. It drinks off dry, with watermelon and red fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",24.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6283,Comartin 2011 The Porterhouse Syrah-Grenache (Central Coast),"This 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache blend, named as an ode to the winemaker's butcher-ancestors, begins with scents of blueberry crème brûlée with a spearmint glaze. The flavors are comparably light, with tarter blueberry, some licorice on the midpalate and a tannic finish.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6284,Cooper-Garrod 2010 Finley Vineyard Estate Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"The pretty but powerful nose is like striking a gusher of black gold in a field of lavender, full of tar, violet and blueberry. Leather and deep purple fruit lead the palate, with charred meat savoriness, black pepper spice and plum skin tannins making a good case for this seven-acre vineyard that was planted in 1998.",29.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6285,Dunham 2011 Trutina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of 57% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Syrah, this opens with a sweetly spiced bouquet of red and purple fruits. The medium weight midpalate brings tart plum and cherry flavors, plentiful acidity and moderate, balanced tannins. Drink now through 2020.",29.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6288,Hobo 2008 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality. This lovely single-vineyard bottling is dry and refined, showing complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. Drink now.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6292,William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",45.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6295,Peju 2006 Reserve Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",95.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6300,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",75.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6302,Miraflores 2006 Botricelli Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is a late-harvest dessert wine blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. It's very rich and very sweet and very easy to like. Backed up with firm acidity, it shows extraordinarily ripe flavors of pineapples, apricots, oranges, honey, crème brûlée, vanilla bean, buttered toast and cinnamon spices.",40.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6303,Hobo 2008 Branham Rockpile Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"A beautiful Zin, dry and spicy. Shows lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, black raspberries, anise, pepper, cola and cedar. A very fine interpretation of a dusty Sonoma Zinfandel.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6320,Buena Vista 2012 Merlot (Carneros),"Made in a relatively light-bodied, soft style, this wine has a weedy, herbal element at its heart, and could use more fruit to balance out. It ends in a taste of bittersweet chocolate and espresso.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
6326,Twisted 2013 Moscato (California),"Light apple and floral aromas lead to rich flavors like apple, honey and grapefruit and a definite sweetness. This wine is fresh and easy to enjoy.",8.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
6335,Wente 2005 Crane Ridge Merlot (Livermore Valley),"Direct and thin, this Merlot has simple currant, cocoa, licorice and oakspice flavors that finish totally dry.",20.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
6339,Baywood 2006 Vineyard Select Symphony (California),Not much going on in this off-dry wine. It has very thin flavors of vanilla and pineapples.,9.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6341,Midnight 2005 Malbec (Paso Robles),"Simple, tannic and harsh, with sugared blackberry tea, raisin and black pepper flavors.",28.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6344,Brutocao 2005 Contento Vineyard Primitivo (Mendocino),"Simple and sweet, this Primitivo has jammy flavors of black raspberries, cherries and chocolate. It's a little heavy and soft.",20.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6345,Maryhill 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",20.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6347,Deerfield Ranch 2004 Cuveé Merlot (North Coast),"Like the '03, this Merlot is a little too sweet for comfort, showing sugary cherry flavors that taste like melted jam. It's also very soft and lacks a firm structure.",27.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6350,Jacuzzi 2006 Morine Ranch Primitivo (Lake County),"Shows blackberry and cherry flavors that taste candied, almost medicinal. Okay with burgers and pizza.",22.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
6356,Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",110.0,97,1,0.999695852416706
6361,Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.",24.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6365,Sanguis 2012 1/1 Syrah (Central Coast),"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace.",125.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6369,Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Winemaker's Release Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A light, refreshing version of the variety from the heart of the Russian River, this traffics in medium-bodied peach and lime, ending with a sweetness of acidity.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6372,Beckmen 2012 Cuvee Le Bac Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6376,Joullian 2014 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley),"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit.",26.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6378,V. Sattui 2010 Dry Riesling (Napa Valley),"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6393,Pinanfarina 2006 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley),"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",55.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
6394,Longoria 2008 Clover Creek Vineyard Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley),"A decent but clumsy wine, showing the pitfalls of this variety in California. It's very dry and silky in texture, but hot in alcohol, and there's a burnt taste to the cherry and oak flavors. Not going anywhere.",36.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
6396,Geyser Peak 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons.",12.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
6406,Fujishin 2009 Bitner Vineyard Viognier,"Thin and tart, sharp citrus rind scents and flavors; then an unexpectedly sugary note in the finish.",15.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
6415,Novy 2011 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.",32.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6416,One Woman 2010 Estate Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Luscious blackberry and cherry notes are marked with hints of bramble and spice in this bold yet elegantly framed wine. The palate feels lush and warm with judicious oak, yet bright, with a shower of cranberry acidity and fine-grain tannins that penetrate through the finish.",48.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6419,Sheldrake Point 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Yellow peaches, waxy white florals and honeysuckle perfume this intensely aromatic wine. Floral notes persist on the palate as well, but are elegantly balanced with soft mineral tones and an invigorating lime acidity. Distinctly elegant, it finishes with a lingering hint of tea leaves.",16.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6428,Doyenne 2011 Métier Red (Red Mountain),"This southern Rhone-style blend consists of 35% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 25% Syrah. Steely minerality underscores pretty cherry fruit, with a light and peppery streak of herb running through the tannins.",44.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6429,Doyenne 2011 Signature Syrah (Red Mountain),"The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins.",42.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6432,Gloria Ferrer 2003 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",70.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6434,Novelty Hill 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Plum and especially blueberry fruit compels your interest immediately. It's cloaked in precisely focused tannins that frame an extended, lightly chocolaty finish.",23.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6460,Sidecar 2015 G-Force Red (Oregon),"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up.",29.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6463,Kokomo 2015 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Bright and generously oaked, this wine is ripe and softly layered, an explosion of strawberry and raspberry that takes on a jammy consistency of power and big flavor.",36.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6467,Niner 2009 Twisted Spur Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and a little warm in alcohol, this blend has rich flavors of red berries, red currants, smoked meat and exotic spices. It's an easy wine to drink with barbecue.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6476,Keuka Spring 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Notes of ripe, fleshy red fruit on the nose and palate are grazed with hints of smoked meat, nuts and dried sage—an appetizing mélange of sweet and savory elements. While it's full bodied, the zesty acidity makes for a refreshing yet satisfying sip.",19.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6478,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Delicate aromas of apple blossoms and fresh pears belie a surprisingly textured, mouthfilling Gewürztraminer, with concentrated stone-fruit flavors and a bristling minerality. Drink now.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6492,Epiphany 2012 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Extremely dense blackberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, grape candy and violets show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on a hillside north of the Santa Maria Valley. The palate packs in-your-face tannins and density, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry and blackberry. Give it time, then serve with the heartiest fare.",40.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6493,Flora Springs 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"With just a handful of Malbec, this wine takes time to open before becoming juicy, herbal and elegant, expressive in tobacco and black tea. The tannins fine and dry.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6496,Lone Birch 2013 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Blue-fruit and spice aromas are vibrant and expressive. The palate is plush and flavorful with a supple feel, while the oak seems dialed back and the balance spot on.",13.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6502,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors.",9.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6503,College Cellars 2013 Cockburn Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Ripe in style, this offers aromas of blueberry pie and spice that lead to rich, full-bodied blue- and black-fruit flavors. There's quite a bit of warmth but the wine's appeal is hard to ignore.",26.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6510,Seven Angels 2012 Kindred Red (Paso Robles),"Condensed blackberries, cassis and a kirsch-like heat hit the nose on this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Syrah and 10% Petite Sirah. More blackberry fruits meet with smoked beef and concentrated violets on the palate.",32.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6512,Waters Crest 2010 Campania Rosso Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Bold and brawny, this voluptuous red floods the palate with ruddy, ripe flavors of black cherries and plums. It's plush and fleshy in mouthfeel, but its juicy, rich demeanor is intoxicating. A dusty mineral tone lends elegance to the finish.",40.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6513,Volatus 2014 Inside Passage Reserve White (Paso Robles),"Made to pair with halibut on the winemaker's annual trip to Alaska, this blend of 68% Viognier, 16% Marsanne and 16% Grenache Blanc shows beeswax, seared pears, caramel corn, apple syrup and peach crème brûlée on the nose. It's light and playful on the palate, with ripe lemons, rounded stone fruit, honeysuckle and citrus zest.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6514,Montevina 2013 Skyland Ridge Zinfandel (Amador County),"Meaty, spicy accents enliven this full-bodied and ripe-tasting wine, adding a layer of interest and depth.

6515,Philo Ridge 2013 Ferrington Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"This dry wine from one of Anderson Valley's storied vineyard properties is full bodied, with a wonderfully rich texture and subtly fruity and layered flavors.

6518,Standing Sun 2012 G-S-M (Santa Barbara County),"Coming from the Chumash tribe-owned Camp 4 Vineyard, this blend of 40% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre offers concentrated violets, blackberry, leather, cedar and interesting tomato leaf on the nose.

6520,Anthony Nappa 2013 Piccolo Pio Petit Verdot (North Fork of Long Island),"A swathe of violet and jolt of pomegranate acidity lend freshness to this voluptuously ripe, rich Petit Verdot. It's an unabashedly forward, full bodied wine chock full of fleshy, plump black-cherry and plum flavors. Despite its brawn, however, it's not at all overbearing, finishing with remarkable balance.",60.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
6522,Shannon 2014 Home Ranch Reserve Malbec (Lake County),"Heavily toasted oak aromas precede spicy, black fruit flavors in this full-bodied, tannic wine. It fires on all cylinders, from its intense smoky, charred aromas to its concentrated blackberry flavors to its mouth-coating, fine-grained tannins that grip the palate and help the finish linger.",32.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

6526,Terra d'Oro 2015 SHR Field Blend Zinfandel (Amador County),"A distinctive smoky, peppery aroma and equally interesting savory flavors complement plenty of ripe fruit in this full-bodied, dry and balanced wine. Co-fermented with Petite Sirah and Barbera, it shows plenty of fine-grained tannins, giving good grip to the palate and more than just fruitiness. Best after 2020.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

6533,Mark Ryan 2014 Water Witch Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (57%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and Petit Verdot all coming from Quintessence Vineyard. Aromas of black tea, smoke, cassis and barrel spice are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors.

6537,Baily 2016 Montage Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Temecula Valley),"Temecula veteran winemaker Phil Baily has cracked the code on making fresh whites in the region's hotter climes, and this blend of 64% Sauvignon Blanc and 36% Sémillon is a stellar example.

Bright acidity carries them into the finish.",23.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6538,Beckmen 2014 Clone #1 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),"The nose of this bottling remains tight long after opening, which suggests a decent cellar potential.

6549,Martin & Weyrich 2005 Flamenco Rojo Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts.

6565,La Capilla 2005 Melange Red (Paso Robles),"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",44.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
6568,Esser Cellars 2005 Zinfandel (California),"Too sweet by far for a table wine, with simple, medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors and a harshly tannic mouthfeel.",10.0,80,1,0.999695852416706
6572,Occasio 2010 Thatcher Bay Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley),"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex.

6573,Peachy Canyon 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Inky black in color, with hard tannins, this Petite Sirah is drinkable now only because it's so soft in acidity and fruity.

6579,Pacific Rim 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L.",10.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6582,Patterson 2012 Forbidden White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price.",18.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6586,Radius 2012 Riesling (Washington),"An aromatic wine with notes of ripe nectarine, honey and jasmine. It's medium sweet with an assortment of dried apricot flavors that display a pleasing sense of balance that continues through the lingering finish.",11.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6588,Syncline 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"One of the few varietal bottlings produced in the state, this concrete-fermented wine brings notes of straw, wet stone, herbs and citrus zest. It's tart and mouthwatering with lemony acidity and a textured feel, screaming out for shellfish to be served alongside it.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6590,Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 426 Red Hen Ranch Meritage (Oak Knoll District),"Merlot heavily dominates this Right Bank-style wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon accounting for only 11% of the blend. That accounts for the softness and the domination of cherries, red currants and violets. The acidity is mouthwatering. It's an easy-drinking wine, with some aspirations to complexity.",18.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6593,Helix by Reininger 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Syrah emphasizes herb and spice, keeping the peppery fruit in the background.

6594,Heron Hill 2010 Bunch Select Late Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Honey and almond notes lend a nutty earthiness to lifted citrus aromas. It's concentrated with sweet tangerine flavor, and has a sharp, zesty acidity that drives a moderately long finish.",34.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6597,Del Dotto 2012 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir Rosé (Fort Ross-Seaview),"This is a big, ripe rosé, with lush red cherry, rosehip tea, apricot and vanilla flavors.

6599,Elsom Cellars 2009 Autonomous Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend is a mix of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot, tart and falling on the thin side. Wild raspberry fruit is accented with scents and flavors of earth and hay. It's aromatic, astringent, and well-suited for grilled meats.",34.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6602,Insania 2010 White (Red Mountain),"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite.

6604,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Grand Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"This Merlot starts off tough and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants and toasty oak, girded with minerals and spices and finishing totally dry.

6619,Elyse 2010 Barrel Select Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Classic Petite Sirah, in the full-bodied richness, dryness, hard tannins and deep flavors of ripe dark berries and fruits, cocoa, grilled meat and black pepper. As good as that is, it also shows the impeccable balance of a fine Napa Valley red wine. Good now with robust meat stews and roasts, and it should develop for many years.",32.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6622,Walla Walla Vintners 2009 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a tight, black-fruited wine, with generous flavors that include espresso and licorice.

6625,Jarvis 2007 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety on its own, but Jarvis does an excellent job. This is still quite tannic, with a hard, astringent mouthfeel to the cherry, blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors. Give this a few more years of aging, although it doesn't seem like a longterm ager.",80.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6629,Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Zinfandel (Amador County),"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue.

6631,Valdez 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",38.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6632,XYZin 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins.

6633,Elements of Sonoma 2004 E3 Red (Knights Valley),"A Bordeaux blend made from this high plateau between Sonoma County and Napa Valley.

6634,Forchini 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",26.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6636,Gary Farrell 2004 Encounter Red (Sonoma County),"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",65.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6638,Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon),"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid.

6640,Ca' del Solo 2006 Dolcetto (Monterey County),"High acidity gives this wine its mouth-tingling, almost sour taste, but oodles of cherries balance it. It's also pretty tannic. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with meats in rich tomato sauce, garlic and cheese.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6641,Cloudline 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),This inexpensive Pinot Gris has pear fruit with spicy highlights that somehow conjure up caraway. It's wrapped in yeasty flavors of fresh-baked bread and plenty of lemony acid.,15.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

6666,Glenora 2002 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not. There's some sugar left in it, it just seems dry if you compare it to the winery's regular, semi-dry version. Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices.",10.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6667,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",35.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6669,Maddalena 2000 Merlot (Central Coast),"Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine.",12.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

6673,Rosenblum 2001 Gallagher Ranch Black Muscat (California),"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge.

6701,Napa Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish.",17.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6704,French Hill 2005 Premium Select Pinotage (Sierra Foothills),"Let's hope this isn't the future of California Pinotage, because the wine smells and tastes Porty, even though the alcohol isn't that high. There's a raisiny, stewed berry element that ends in a dry, harsh finish.",32.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
6705,Grgich Hills 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.",40.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

6712,Bridgeview 2006 Gewürztraminer (Southern Oregon),"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape.

6718,Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania),"The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence.

6719,Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",15.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

6724,Bridgeview 2004 Black Beauty Syrah (Southern Oregon),"The entrance of violets and black cherry is offset by volatility and lingering scents and flavors of nail polish through the wine's mid-palate. It finishes with earthy, rough tannins",20.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
6727,Kitá 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This wine, made by Native American descendent Tara Gomez from the Chumash tribe, is dynamic on the nose. It shows both ripeness and minerality, with aromas of crystallized white peach, dewy herbs, green apples and a hint of guava. It's tight, steely and chalky once sipped, opening toward ripe pome fruit and cut grass, ever-evolving in the glass without going overripe.",22.0,92,1,0.999695852416706

6737,Cedarville Vineyard 2012 Naylor Vineyard Petite Sirah (El Dorado),"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish.

6759,St. Supéry 2006 Elu Red (Napa Valley),"Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint.

6763,Blue Rock 2008 Baby Blue Red (Alexander Valley),"A very pleasant wine for drinking now.

6767,Heron Hill 2008 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Zippy and fresh with a gentle prickle on the tongue, this dry Riesling smells of sweet, fresh apples laced with just a hint of petrol.

6781,Bernardus 2007 Marinus Red (Carmel Valley),"Another successful Marinus from this small Monterey County appellation. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it's dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and cedar, and is more rough in tannins than your typical Napa Cabernet blend.

6839,Apolloni 2016 L Cuvée Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A small portion of this wine (10%) is barrel fermented, which seems to slightly soften and round out the feel. Fleshy pear and apple comes with a hint of honey on the palate.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6854,Y Rousseau 2009 Cavedale Vineyards Pépé Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"You get plenty of rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cappuccino and peppery spice flavors in this briskly tannic, dry young Merlot. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, though. Drink up.",39.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
6855,Smasne Cellars 2010 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A sweet-and-sour wine that mixes sour lemon candy with honey cough-drop elements. There is also an underlying streak of baby aspirin flavor, and the different aspects of the wine are not quite pulled together.",18.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
6865,Knapp 2010 Sunrise Hill Vineyard Semi-Dry Gewürztraminer (Cayuga Lake),"There's a hint of caramelized sugar on the nose of this off-dry Gewürztraminer that gives an edge to all the succulent sweet pear nectar and apple blossoms notes that permeate the palate. Elegantly floral, it finishes with a touch of characteristic orange and clove spice.",15.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
6867,Wrath 2013 Ex Anima Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor.",19.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6869,Animale 2011 Dolcetto (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, though labeled simply Columbia Valley. Tart pomegranate fruit, a seam of clay and well-integrated highlights of herb and earth mark this extremely limited-production wine as special. Dolcetto does not have much of a track record in Washington, but what's here is quite promising.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6874,Va Piano 2013 Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb. It's all about the fruit, and bravo for that.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6880,Decoy 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Smoothly seductive in bright red-berry and pomegranate fruit, this young Zinfandel comes from mostly Dry Creek Valley vineyards. Rippling in baking spice and subtle vanilla oak, it's a complete wine, with balanced acidity and mellowed tannins. Clean and long on the finish, it will complement rather than overpower a meal.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
6889,Courtney Benham 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication.",14.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6891,Bonneau 2005 Epos Meritage (Napa Valley),"It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.",60.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
6912,Boatique 2014 Petite Sirah (Red Hills Lake County),"Relatively light for the variety, this wine has lots of tasty, almost jammy fruit flavors, medium tannins and a smooth but gripping texture. It's very good to drink now.",26.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6914,Cerulean 2010 Underwood Mountain Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Well-aged, light gold, and bottled in a Burgundy bottle for reasons unknown, this off dry high-acid effort should be consumed within the next year or two. The apple fruit has moved into secondary (baked) flavors, with a tart kick to the finish suggesting that the acids may soon outstrip the fruit.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6915,Charles Smith 2014 The Velvet Devil Merlot (Washington),"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip.",12.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6922,DENO 2008 Paso Rouge Alto Pomar Vineyard Estate G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Tons of candied grape and lilac aromas show on the nose of this rather aged blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, with root beer and blueberry-sorbet notes. The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6927,Sweet Cheeks 2015 Riesling (Oregon),"Off dry, fresh and lightly spritzy, this appealing wine brings flavors of lemon tea front and center. The aromatics hint at honeysuckle and orange blossom, and the finish is pleasantly granular, with a sweet, sugary edge.",15.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6933,Laurelwood 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"The Laurelwood offers sharp flavors of pine tar, threaded through fresh fruit. Apple and orange are there in abundance, and the piny accents will be an interesting highlight for some tasters, but a distraction for others.",24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6937,Pacific Rim 2015 Twin Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",16.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
6946,Matthews 2014 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (23%), Cabernet Franc (13%), Malbec (6%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herb, flower, pencil lead, cherry jam and spice lead to light tart, fresh fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6951,Rasa 2013 Fianchetto Xl Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically expressive, with notes of raspberry, cigar box, mint, café au lait, blackberry, dried herb, anise and wet gravel. The palate displays a sense of elegance and refinement that captures the attention, with red-fruit flavors lingering on the long (slightly warm) finish.",95.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6955,Saracina 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),Floral and wet-stone aromas are followed by tangy kiwi and jicama flavors keeping to a nicely dry profile. This distinctive wine from extremely consistent Saracina has bracing acidity and good concentration but remains on the subtle side.,23.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6956,Sequel 2014 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of fruit from Boushey, Bacchus, The Benches and Candy Mountain vineyards. Very primary aromas of smoke, toast, char and cherry are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors. The oak seems a little heavy handed at times but it still brings a lot of appeal.",60.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6958,Stevens 2014 StevensBlackTongue Syrah (Yakima Valley),"High-toned aromas of blackberry, aniseed, macerated cranberry, motor oil and flower lead to rich full-bodied cranberry and blackberry flavors that bring a sense of hedonism.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6960,Toccata 2013 Classico Red (Santa Barbara County),"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured.",24.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
6967,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2012 WCS Jack John Red (Paso Robles),"This Willow Creek district winery delivers a powerful blend of 71% Grenache, 19% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier. It offers aromas of black licorice, black cherry and elderberry, with roasted meat in the background. It's very rich, bursting with flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar that evolve toward creosote and tar, all wrapped up in silky tannins.",75.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6972,Michael Gill Cellars 2012 Black Tie Syrah (Paso Robles),"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",70.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6975,Darioush 2013 Viognier (Napa Valley),"This perfumey white dances in intense and creamy layers of stone fruit and vanilla, remaining vibrant and balanced from start to finish. The generous fruit is grown in the relatively cooler Oak Knoll section of the Napa Valley. This should develop further over time and in the glass.",41.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6978,Gordon Estate 2012 Estate Grown Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish.",35.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6985,Barden 2012 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Pepper rules this cool-climate, low-alcohol take on the grape by Doug Margerum, with both white and black pepper giving spice to blackened beef and blackberry fruits. The rich yet tart flavors trend toward boysenberry, with dried oregano and basil apparent alongside the very prominent cracked peppercorns.",50.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6986,J & J 2012 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine dazzles the senses with notes of freshly roasted coffee, char, dark plum and sweet spices. It's medium bodied with thoroughly delicious coffee flavors backed by a soft feel.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6991,Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is an exclamation point of a wine. The fruit pops with pure notes of black and red plum along with herbs and milk chocolate. It's fresh and fruit-filled, with an elegant, palate-coating texture that simply dazzles the senses.",24.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6992,Waterbrook 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended with 12% Grenache and 8% Roussanne, this direct and appealing wine suggests violets, raspberries and plum, with a vanilla top note (21% new American oak). The coffee and blue fruit flavors are rich and full, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. It's a complete knockout for this price.",14.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
6994,Eliseo Silva 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection.",10.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6995,Enkidu 2008 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6997,Frostwatch 2009 Kismet White (Bennett Valley),"Quite an impressive wine, especially at this price. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon without much oak, it's an interestingly complex white, with good weight and density and intricate flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and lemongrass. Finishes totally dry, although the acidity is a little clumsy.",21.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
6998,Glen Fiona 2006 Basket Press Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The best of Glen Fiona's current releases, this displays cool-climate varietal character, with mountain berry fruit, herb, spice, tar and a streak of licorice.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7002,Mirassou 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Great price for a super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc. Brilliantly crisp and mouthwateringly clean, it delivers bone-dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with a wildflowery spiciness.",12.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7003,Villa San Juliette 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A big, soft, juicy Petite Sirah filled with rich flavors of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, blueberries and peppery spices. Feels voluptuous in the mouth, almost like a liquid dessert, but it's nice and dry on the finish. Good value.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7011,Columbia Crest 1999 Grand Estates Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G.",11.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7014,Peirano 1998 Shiraz (Lodi),"This pretty wine shows how well this variety thrives in Lodi. There's a mushu pork note, with peppery plum aromas and flavors that are delicious, and yet the wine is bone dry. Adequate acids and tannins make for balance. It may not be a complex wine but it's a thoroughly enjoyable one. Best Buy.",10.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7015,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Fumé Blanc (Idaho),"The winery's penchant for delicate, lightly balanced wines is again evident here. This has some pleasant herb flavors, gentle nuances of grass and citrus. Cleanly made and finished with a touch of spice. —P.G.",10.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7021,Sariah Cellars 2000 Syrah (Red Mountain),"Add this new winery to the growing list of Walla Walla-based boutiques. The Syrah is plump and juicy, a round, fruity red wine that is perfectly enjoyable. —P.G.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7023,Mayo 2000 Ricci Vineyard Unfiltered Zinfandel Port Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Mayo knows how to make sweetish Zins that should be dry. Here's their effort at an outrightly sweet Zin, and it ain't bad. Curranty, raisiny aromas lead to cassis and blackberry jam flavors that are immensely ripe, and the sugar level is dessert-high. It's warmly satisfying. Try with, or over, vanilla ice cream, and be happy. —S.H.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7026,Columbia Winery 1999 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. —P.G.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7027,Columbia Winery 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is one of Columbia's strengths, turning out perfectly crafted white wines at budget prices. The Gewürz is off-dry, rich and roundly fruity, loaded with mouthfilling, lipsmacking flavors. Chill it to cut the sweetness and you have the perfect wine for spicy noodle dishes.",7.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7028,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too.",8.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7029,Yorkville Cellars 1997 Cabernet Franc (Yorkville Highlands),"This Bordeaux variety more often than not produces a light, fruity wine of charm and early drinkability. Here, the sour cherry fruit is framed in dry, dusty tannins and soft acids. There's an elegance and spicy aftertaste that are very nice. —S.H.",17.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7032,Columbia Crest 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A wonderfully fragrant nose mixes scents of fresh fruits and  blossoms, with a sweet and tart flavor profile. These are very user friendly flavors, ripe and round, with more fatness than most Washington Rieslings, especially at this price. Best Buy.",7.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7035,Gargiulo 2000 Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Oakville),"Kicks off with pretty cherry notes in the nose. Dry and bright on the palate, the wine shows lovely ripe Bing cherry flavors, elegant citrus and clean mineral notes. A refreshing and satisfying rosé.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7037,II Moons 2011 Ardor Red (Paso Robles),"Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate.",40.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
7044,Chimney Rock 2012 Elevage Estate Grown Red (Stags Leap District),"A proprietary blend of 57% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, all homegrown, this is dense and powerful, rich in red fruit but also savory in tobacco, black tea and leather. Reflective of the appellation's ability to combine power with elegance, it fully represents and should continue to meld beautifully together in the cellar. Drink now through 2022.",96.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
7050,Robert Biale 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard The Biale Block Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Planted in 1999 specifically for the producer, this vineyard block provides power and structure, revealing shocks of blackberry jam, mocha and gunpowder amidst a streak of wild anise and black pepper. Robust and bold, it begs for another 10 to 15 years in the cellar before finding its complete composure.",50.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
7073,Santa Barbara Winery 2011 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"High alcohol, with its burn and glyceriney sweetness, mars this otherwise good Syrah. The tannins are polished and smooth, the acidity brisk and clean, but the wine's raisiny, port-like finish detracts.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7074,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Pinot Fusion Red (Oregon),"The Fusion in question is the blend—an unusual combination of 61% Pinot Noir, 21% Syrah and 18% Merlot. Some tasters will find it works well as an everyday, all-purpose red. The jumble of red fruits is matched to a strong streak of vanilla, with some stemmy flavors coming up in the tannins.",18.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7078,Guyomar 2010 Oblate Red (Paso Robles),"The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Syrah. The wine is dry, hot in alcohol and overripe, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors.",42.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7083,Collection 35 2012 Brut Sparkling (Sta. Rita Hills),"Blended from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this sparkler is a little rough in texture, with candied orange, lemon and lime flavors. But it has good bubbles and a clean, elegant finish.",39.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7084,Due Cani 2009 Bella's Collection Syrah (Spring Mountain District),"Tannins mark this big, dry Syrah. It shows Spring Mountain's intensity of fruit, in this case blackberries, but that tannic bitterness dominates, making the wine difficult to appreciate. It's hard to imagine it aging.",33.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7089,Sanglier Cellars 2011 Rouge du Tusque Red (Sonoma County),"It's explosive in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries, with a hit of caramelized oak. Drink it now with simple fare.",26.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7090,Stama 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),This smoky Zinfandel is aromatically closed off and still tight in tannic formation. Give it time to open and it'll share meaty black-fruit and tar.,24.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
7092,The Federalist 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi),"This medium-bodied wine has a vivid, fresh raspberry aroma and deep blackberry flavors supported by firm tannins. It tastes like a cool-climate example because of the vivid fruit, layered tannins and good acidity, which make it well balanced in the style of classic dry reds.",22.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
7102,August Briggs 2012 Old Vines Zinfandel (Calistoga),"Faint aromatics hide an effusiveness on the palate of thick, dense blackberry jam and brown sugar, the ripe power of the wine kept in check by a balance of acidity. Fuller bodied in style, it remains dry and vibrant on the finish.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
7108,Fenestra 2013 Semillon (Livermore Valley),"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
7109,Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Riesling (Santa Barbara County),"Yellow skinned and Asian pears, jasmine flowers, lemon slices and a slight petrol note entertain the nose on this single-vineyard bottling from a part of the Parker family's estate that was planted in 1989. The palate is quite balanced between flavors of lemon-lime soda, tangerine juice and limestone minerality.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
7119,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2005 Little Bear Creek Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This affordable blend of all five Bordeaux grapes is a solid second wine, produced from barrels cut from the winery's other bottlings. It hits 14.5% alcohol but remains reasonably well balanced, with just a touch of heat. It's dark and smoky, with plenty of barrel flavors. Cherry liqueur, smoke, caramel and espresso—it gives you a lot of power for the price.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
7123,Arbor Crest 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal – these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish.",11.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
7124,Syncline 2006 Cinsault (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a pretty, pale purple/rose; bright, peppery and rather delicate. It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine. The acids keep it lively, the peppery notes add a lot of spice and the floral qualities turn the tart cranberry fruit into something special.",22.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
7134,Stony Lonesome 2013 Estate Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes),"While exuberantly floral, this wine feels weightless and breezy on the palate. It's a bit lacking in concentration, but tart grapefruit and pineapple flavors make it refreshing and quaffable.",14.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7135,The Farm Winery 2011 The Big Game Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot retains a reductive quality on the nose even after being opened for quite a while, with slightly funky blackberry and burnt cedar aromas. Dried blackberries and black cherries show on the palate, but the tarry sensation permeates throughout.",75.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7136,Trump 2014 Rosé (Monticello),"Pink grapefruit and lemon rind notes are elevated on the nose, with wet stone and candied watermelon lingering in the background. The palate on this 100% Merlot rosé is citrus-driven, yet an impression of roundness comes from tart peach and melon tones.",14.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7140,Henry Earl 2012 Malbec (Red Mountain),"This 100% varietal wine has aromas of vanilla, milk chocolate and dark fruit along with light oxidative notes. It's fully flavored with coffee and dark cherry notes backed by gritty tannins.",40.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

7145,Pear Valley 2013 Viognier (Paso Robles),"The nose on this wine is very peachy, boosted in the ripe department by banana, honeysuckle and tuberose. The palate is also rich and forward, with dried apricots and buttered peaches. It's well made, just quite tropical, and would complement roasted chicken.",21.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7153,Fulkerson 2014 Rosé (Finger Lakes),"While a bit shy in both bouquet and concentration, this cherry-kissed rosé is a refreshing summer sip. A blend of Pinot Noir and Dornfelder, it's a touch tart with a brisk, zippy finish.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

7168,Signorello 2009 SETA Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"At first, this wine tastes overworked, with very ripe pineapple, lime and mango flavors elaborated with sweet new oak.

7170,Tablas Creek 2010 Patelin de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),"Delicious flavors in this blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne. Rich in apricots, oranges and honeysuckles, it's a little soft and sweet, but fancy. Drink now.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

Shy at first, it allows room for an earthy element of compost and is dark and brooding all around, with sizable, tamed, chalky tannin. Leather, black pepper, licorice and cinnamon all make an appearance, adding to the wine's complexity and likability.",41.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
7456,Yao Family Wines 2014 Napa Crest Red (Napa Valley),"This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend, with 25% Merlot and 12% Petit Verdot.

7459,Apex 2012 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatically reserved for a dessert wine, with apricot and pear. It's lusciously sweet, with abundant stone fruit flavors but could use a bit more concentration and acidity to hold it together.",18.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

7481,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Papa Joe's Private Stash Mondeuse (Applegate Valley),"Mondeuse is a specialty at Plaisance Ranch, but this new vintage seems a bit dilute.

7531,Sanford 2013 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills),"A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea.

7534,Terre Rouge 2013 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Classic flavors, great structure and impressive depth make this wine tempting to drink now, but it will certainly improve with age. Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors. It has that slightly wild, gamey character of the Rhône, along with ripe but slightly restrained fruit and spices. Best from 2018 to 2023.",40.0,92,1,0.999695852416706

7561,Inspire Moore 2014 Gratitude White (Finger Lakes),"Whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white.

7564,Kunde 2009 Limited Selection Petite Verdot (Sonoma Valley),"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many.

7565,La Sirena 2009 Pirate TreasuRed Red (Napa Valley),"Whatever the blend is on this red wine, and winemaker Heidi Barrett isn't saying, it's really interesting. The bottle is old-fashioned and stubby, like something from the 1700s. The wine itself is immediately likeable for its spicy array of spices and berries. Despite its upfront appeal, there's a complexity that elevates it.",60.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
7569,a-non-ah-mus 2009 Alisos Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This is made in a ripe, high-alcohol style, which gives it a little burning sensation, like Cognac.

7570,Ballentine 2008 Estate Grown Pocai Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"The Pocai Vineyard is a very interesting one, growing Chenin Blanc, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and the wines are always worth looking into.

Particularly bright in red cherries, it's a beautiful wine for drinking over the next year or two.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
7585,Ponzi 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Fragrant with floral notes, lemony fruit and hints of apricot, this is a tangy, textural take on Pinot Gris.

7599,Philo Ridge 2009 Nelson Ranch Viognier (Mendocino),A lightly golden Viognier very floral in jasmine and white peach. It's sweet at first but minerally in the finish and subtle for what can be an overbearing variety at times.,19.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
7611,Tercero 2007 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Feels too soft and rather one-dimensional, although the flavors are very good. The best thing about the wine, aside from dryness, is the richness of tannins. The fruit veers toward blackberry marmalade and currants. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",28.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7614,Morgan 2008 Syrah (Monterey),"Gets the job done with its rich tannins, crisp acids and solid blackberry, mocha and orange zest flavors. Easy to drink, and ready now. Production was 1,685 cases.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7621,Comtesse Thérèse 2005 First Harvest Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"After the scent of char blows off a bit, this first harvest Merlot opens sweetly to aromas of vanilla, cinnamon spice and plush, red plums. There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.",18.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7622,Comtesse Thérèse 2006 Aquebogue Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak.

7632,Comtesse Thérèse 2004 Château Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Layers of char, black pepper and briar patch help to build complexity in this dense, concentrated black plum Merlot.

Aged 24 months in new French oak.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7633,EOS 2005 Cupa Grandis Grand Barrel Reserve Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"As sharp, fresh and fruity as a jar of raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, melted into liquid and fortified with alcohol. Feels hot, too, despite an official alcohol reading of just 14%. The winery held this back for five years, an expensive investment in storage, but the wine just can't quite overcome its limitations.",60.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
7637,Keira 2014 G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. Vanilla aromas are prominent along with prune and other dried fruit. Fruit and barrel flavors intermingle on the palate, with the fruit seeming dried out.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
7639,Liberty Lake 2011 Merlot (Red Mountain),"Barrel aromas are out front with notes of wood spice, vanilla and cocoa followed by dark cherries and herb, starting to show a bit of age.

7651,Buena Vista 2014 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County),"A mix of unidentified red varieties, this wine opens slowly, without much in the way of aromatics.

7658,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2015 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"While ripe nectarine and grapefruit notes are bold on the nose, the palate of this medium-bodied Gewürztraminer is a bit demure.

7680,Paumanok 2013 Assemblage Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Decadent yet finessed, this intensely ripe, concentrated wine brims with fleshy flavors of black plum and cassis.

It's lovely already, but should meld beautifully from 2020–2030 and further.",50.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
7683,Foxen 2014 Tinaquaic Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Violets, bacon fat and caramel sauce are drizzled across blueberry and olallieberry fruits on the nose of this bottling from Billy Wathen and Dick Dore.

7752,J. Bookwalter 2010 Foreshadow Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, sends up toasty aromatics richly imbued with the scents of new oak. John Bookwalter consistently makes wines in this style, which in a cooler year such as 2010, can seem to mask the fruit. Give it plenty of breathing time and the blackberry and black cherry core will begin to emerge from the toast, mocha and coffee.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
7755,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A first for Lauren Ashton, this barrel-fermented Sémillon was sourced from the excellent Dineen Vineyard. It's firm and tightly packed with melon, jicama, pineapple and green banana fruit. Highlights of honeysuckle and lemon verbena are also in the mix.

8099,The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"Crisp and distinctive, with a strong mineral streak, this full-flavored Pinot Blanc has a range of fruit flavors, centered upon apple and pear, but also touching on blood orange and a suggestion of celery as well. Low in alcohol, but high in flavor.",19.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8122,Monte Volpe 2015 Sesso White (Mendocino County),"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8130,Deaver 2013 Petite Sirah (Amador County),"Traces of charred oak in the aroma and a flood of extremely ripe dark-fruit flavors come with a sense of depth and concentration in this full-bodied, very firm and tannic but nevertheless polished wine. This is higher in alcohol than the last two vintages reviewed. It will benefit from more age or a high-protein pairing.",27.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8132,Donkey & Goat 2016 Clair + Ette Barsotti Vineyard Clairette (El Dorado),"The gold color and buttery flavors give this wine a rich personality for such a low-alcohol level and for a varietal that is often crisp and light. Almost mainstream in style compared to most D&G offerings, it has vanilla, pear and almond to add complexity and a smooth broad texture that soothes the palate.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8133,Eternal 2015 Rocketman Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot and 5% Carmenère is fragrant, with raspberry, freshly sliced bell pepper and green herb notes.

8137,Sobon Estate 2016 Rosé (Amador County),"Showing lots of lively citrus aromas, and crisp white-peach flavors, this wine tastes very refreshing.

8138,Suhru 2013 Ember Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Ripe, sun-kissed plum and blackberry flavors are crisply balanced in this juicy, velvet-textured red. It's lavishly oaky, streaked with layers of spice, toast and caramel, but maintains elegance and brightness throughout. The finish is marked by fine-grained but penetrating tannins.",19.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8139,Tensley 2015 Syrah (Central Coast),"Impressively thick and dark for Joey Tensley's new entry-level brand, this wine's deep and dark aromas of slate-flecked soil makes for a very earthy impression on the nose, along with expected hints of tar, purple flowers and boysenberry. Condensed cassis flavors show on the sip along with hints of lavender and blueberry, laced together by soft tannins and an upright acidity.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8148,Bargetto 2014 Regan Vineyards Nebbiolo (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young.",40.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8152,Substance 2008 Cf Cabernet Franc (Washington),"This is made in the somewhat austere style of a Loire valley Chinon, done well here, adding nothing harsh, bitter or unpleasant to the wine. You will also find soft plum and cherry fruit, modest but perfectly ripe and proportionate, rounding out the midpalate.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
8156,Dunham 2007 Three Legged Red Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Deliciously bright and spicy, its cranberry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with pepper and cinnamon. With more breathing time it fleshes out, fills in with pretty pie cherry flavors and some pleasing toastiness.",17.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
8166,Kiona 2012 Estate Bottled Lemberger (Red Mountain),"Lemberger was planted here in the 1970s, and Kiona still carries the torch for the grape. Earthy, gamy, soft and smooth, it has a quickly maturing flavor set, built upon chocolate and cherries, with dusty tannins.",15.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8167,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Estate Bottled Unoaked T23 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Touches of sage and tarragon breathe freshness into succulent red cherry and berry aromas on this rich, full-bodied Cabernet Franc.

8169,William Hill Estate 2011 Benchmark Red (Napa Valley),"Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot combine harmoniously in this concentrated, structured and brooding red wine.

8172,Portalupi 2012 Old Vine Dolinsek Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Lush in brambly blackberry, this classic Zinfandel comes from a cooler area than usual, the Russian River Valley, which manages to retain small plantings of the variety amid the larger seas of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

8182,Clos du Val 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Winemaker Kristy Melton continues to show a sense of restraint in her wines.

Structure and elegance reign here over power and oak.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8186,Kiona 2012 Syrah (Red Mountain),"From young vines, this wine offers up pretty scents of rose petals and lightly peppery strawberries. Just 5% Mourvèdre was included, but its presence brings a dash of extra spice and herb.",25.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

8197,Emmolo 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This seems sweet in jammy pineapple and lemon fruit. It's an easy wine, balanced by crisp acidity and a clean finish.",16.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

8216,Foxen 2012 Toasted Rope Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose.

8218,Dashe Cellars 2012 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A blend of five vineyards, some of which go into single-vineyard designates, this is a well made, structured wine, offering layers of black cherry and subtle earth around soft, velvety tannins.

8222,Ridge 2012 Geyserville Red (Alexander Valley),"Bold flavors and a graceful mouthfeel come together in this classic, complex and well-balanced red, made from 71% Zinfandel with other traditional California varieties. The blackberry, sage and ever-so-slightly earthy aromas continue through the flavors, where they interlace with firm tannins and supportive acidity. This could easily improve through 2019.",38.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8224,Alta Colina 2011 Toasted Slope Estate Syrah (Paso Robles),"Pleasantly dank aromas of smoldering pine needles, leather and gamy meats hit the nose on this 2% Viognier coferment.

8227,Krutz 2010 Krupp Vineyard Malbec (Napa Valley),"There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes.

8235,Barton 2011 Mr. Jones Grenache (Paso Robles),"Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017–2023.",36.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8238,Claiborne & Churchill 2013 Gewurztraminer (Central Coast),"From a winery focused on Alsatian wines since starting in 1983, this tremendous Gewürztraminer is redolent with grilled lemon peels, lilac and a chalky minerality.

8239,Whitecliff Vineyard 2010 Traminette (New York),"While exuberantly floral—almost soapy—on the nose, this dry, full-bodied Traminette is surprisingly elegant on the palate with crisp, fresh apple flavors accented with soft Meyer lemon acidity and a blossomy jasmine tea note on the finish.",16.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8240,Acorn 2008 Axiom Alegría Vineyards Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Too sharp in texture, with a cut of acidity that emphasizes the white pepper, and seems to bring out some greenness. Other than that, you'll find a smoothly tannic wine, with blackberry and currant fruit.",33.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8246,Sterling 2010 Vintner's Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"Almost too green and minty, but stops just short of unripeness to give a tantalizing gooseberry edge to the lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. Dry and elegantly structured, it's a fine wine to drink with ethnic fare ranging from Mexican to Vietnamese and Middle Eastern.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8251,Coquerel Family Wine Estates 2010 Verdelho (Calistoga),"An interesting wine by virtue of its oddball variety and the way it feels in the mouth. It's bone dry and quite high in acidity, giving it an ultra-clean mouthfeel framing citrus and mineral flavors that are a bit vegetal. Needs stimulating food, especially umami-dominated.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8256,Bergevin Lane 2008 Francisca's Vineyard Princess Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"At the moment the pleasant fruit seems completely overmatched by the heavily charred, smoky barrel flavors. Even after substantial breathing time the fruit failed to fill out, and the finish turned a bit watery and slightly bitter.",52.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8270,Orchid Hill 2006 Private Reserve Viognier (Paso Robles),"What a great improvement the '06 is over the '05. It's considerably lower in alcohol, and much more balanced and crisp. Yet the flavors are ripe and seductive, in peaches, pears, papayas, honeysuckle flowers and oak-influenced butter, honey and vanilla. Great with Thai food.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8272,Rosenthal-Malibu Estate 2004 The Devon Vineyard Merlot (Malibu-Newton Canyon),"An eccentric, but not unlikeable, Merlot, with very ripe, almost baked, black currant flavors that have been well-oaked. Bone-dry, the wine finishes with the taste of exotic Asian spices.",26.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8279,Ballentine 2007 Pocai Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Napa Valley),"Always an interesting, exotically offbeat wine, Ballentine's '07 is particularly crisp and savory. It's showing pineapple, green apple, tangerine, fig, vanilla and honey flavors that finish with a clean, dry streak of minerality. Very nice as an alternative to Viognier or Sauvignon Blanc.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8282,Surfrider 2004 Red (Malibu-Newton Canyon),"Dry and balanced, this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot has cherry, cassis and smoky oak flavors. It's marked by considerable acidity that gives it a racy sharpness. From Malibu Estate.",29.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8286,Clos du Bois 2013 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"An intriguing oak spiciness on both the nose and the palate makes this medium-bodied wine interesting without overpowering the focused and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors. The wine's texture is lean, braced by fine-grained tannins that give support and balance. Best after 2018.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8289,DeTierra Vineyards 2014 Mesa Del Sol Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"This is a vibrant take on the grape, with fresh-pressed boysenberry and wisteria aromas merging with rosemary, fennel and sarsaparilla on the nose. Food friendly, it shows more boysenberry, thyme, white pepper, and floral freshness on the palate.",30.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8291,Rancho Sisquoc 2014 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"Sweet cedar aromas kick off this attention-grabbing bottling, with elderberry and black plum scents combining for an Old World feel in which the structure can be sensed on sniff alone. Wood and graphite notes pop on the palate, where a loamy riverstone minerality courses through black currant flavors, finishing on chocolate cake.",20.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8292,Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 First Born King Red (Paso Robles),"Dark in the glass, this blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is rich and appealing, made in the typical Paso style. Vanilla, cola, spice cake and black cherry aromas lead to a palate laden with milk chocolate, more black cherry, and star anise flavors. The tannins are soft and lush.",34.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8293,Seven Deadly Zins 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Savory pepper and grilled beef aromas make this wine appetizing, its rich berry and ripe plum flavors bringing excellent concentration and depth to the palate.

8306,Melrose 2015 Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"This captures all the ripe fruit and fresh mouthfeel you could ask for in a young Riesling.

8314,Abacela 2014 Fiesta Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price.",23.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8315,Hanna 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Apricot, fig and fresh-cut grass intertwine on the nose of this pungently crisp white, lengthy in honeydew melon. Light bodied and lightly textured, it offers a burst of acidity on the finish.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8316,Robert Hall 2013 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Strong gravel, slate and other rocky mineral elements show on the nose of this wine, which also boasts black-cherry compote aromas.

8325,Wait Cellars 2014 Los Amigos Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),"Velvety texture underlies dusty tannins and neutral oak in this light and lean wine from a vineyard in the heart of Pinot Noir country.

8329,Eberle 2013 Steinbeck Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"Boysenberry, violets and a touch of bacon fat show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on Paso's Eastside. The palate is upright in both tannins and searing acidity, with flavors of tart blueberry and black peppercorn.",26.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8331,Epiphany 2014 Camp Four Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara County),"Pear blossom, baked lemons, packed lemon flowers, apple juice, walnut and a touch of quinine pop on the nose of this wine from a challenging grape. The palate is rich but zesty with walnut oil, chamomile, lime, apple and pear notes, offering lots of textural intrigue.",25.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8336,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2013 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine is slightly austere at the start, despite its fuller body and style. Leathery and dusty in tannin, the black and blue fruit remain elusive, teasing in between bouts of coffee and chocolate.",17.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8344,Bonny Doon 2010 Le Cigare Volant Reserve Red (Central Coast),"Fresh-flowing blood, dried Italian herbs and cured cuts of meat greet the nose on this annual Bonny Doon treat, a blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane.

8353,Sparkman 2012 Ring of Fire Petite Sirah (Yakima Valley),"From Olsen vineyard grapes, this is brawny, ripe, dark and oaky—what else would you expect? It's a take-no-prisoners red that is loaded with spicy blackberry fruit. Tannins are ripe and in proportion, and the fruit has that notable lift from vivid acidity that sets Washington reds apart.",42.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8355,Dusted Valley 2012 Squirrel Tooth Alice Red (Wahluke Slope),"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest.",39.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8366,Bonny Doon 2009 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce",38.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8374,The Dancing Fox 2011 Côtes du Renard Red (Lodi),"Sweet-seeming aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied, ripe-tasting wine—not unusual for a Rhône-style blend that leads with  Grenache. A spicy, smoky influence is delicious in its own right, but has a tasty component of fresh blackberry and boysenberry to back it up.",26.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8376,Ledger David 2011 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Pure Syrah, this is young, spicy and crisp, with blue plum, red licorice and a streak of dark chocolate. It has a light suggestion of the gamy, cured meat character that typifies Syrah. This marks a good start for such young (second leaf) vines.",35.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8377,Ledger David 2012 Sangiovese (Rogue Valley),"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip.",24.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8379,Lone Madrone 2012 Martinelli Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly.",60.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8391,Prospect 772 2012 The Truant G-S-M (Sierra Foothills),"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.",36.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8404,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With alcohol at an astounding 16.5%, this Zin tastes hot and peppery. Some high alcohol wines have a fat sweetness that makes them delicious. This one's bone dry, with dried blackberry and cherry flavors that finish with a burn.",40.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
8410,Grayson 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles),"For an affordable, everyday red, this is a pretty good investment. It's dry and full-bodied, with berry, earth, mocha and spice flavors.",10.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
8415,St. Supéry 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold. The acidity is very high, almost making the wine what the French call pétillant, or fizzy.",21.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
8422,Donati 2005 Merlot (Paicines),"Overly ripe and sugary sweet, this Merlot, with a splash of Cab, has a rustic feeling. There is ripe fruit and fine tannins, but the sweetness is a problem.",25.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
8430,Gramercy 2013 John Lewis Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's the stem inclusion that shows itself first, with aromas of olive and herb in front of violets, red fruit, pepper, earth and whiffs of coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are reserved, supple and polished, with bright acids keeping it all in focus. It demands food alongside it to be properly appreciated.",85.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8431,Palmina 2008 Sisquoc Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley),"Black cherries, leather, dried rose petals, rustic cinnamon, bloody meat, graphite, cherry cola and vanilla bean show on the wondrously layered nose of this Steve Clifton bottling. It's still a tad young on the palate, which is grippy with sticky tannins, but shows cola, brown spice, cinnamon, cardamom cream, tart plum fruit and a lasting dried mint element. Drink 2018 through 2028.",60.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8433,Raphael 2013 Primo Reserve Estate Bottled Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Ripe, rich fruit and bold, mouth dampening tannins express the rugged muscularity of this wine. A blend of classic Bordeaux grape varieties, it highlights pristine black cherry and cassis against a backdrop of spice, cedar, barnyard and tobacco complexities. It needs a few years to ease off its brawniness, but should improve beautifully through at least 2023.",75.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8449,Dry Creek Vineyard 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From vines averaging 95 years old, this is an impressive effort, in balance between savory, sultry overtones of peppercorn and espresso and a riper, juicier core of blackberry.

8455,Stanburn 2011 Meadow Breeze Sweet White (Virginia),"A scent of burnt sugar hits the nose first, followed by blasts of papaya and kiwi.

8456,Vivác Winery 2007 V. by Vivác Single Vineyard Merlot (New Mexico),"A blend of 85% Merlot, 10% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has an oxidative aroma that overrides the scents of cassis, blackberry, spiced mocha and vanilla.

8459,Bread & Butter 2012 Riesling (California),"Made without oak, this Riesling is slightly sweet with sugary orange and peach flavors. It lacks the acidity to balance the sweetness, which makes the finish cloying.",15.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

8543,Saracina 2013 Pick and Shovel Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too.

8545,The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado),"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins.

8552,Spangler 2015 Viognier (Southern Oregon),"This bright and spicy wine is packed with botanical flavors.

8554,Terre Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8556,Three 2013 Live Oak Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist.

8557,Three 2013 Old Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style.

The chalky tannins still need time to evolve, but the black pepper, dark fruit, incense and myrrh flavors are well balanced.",48.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8584,Kimsey 2014 White (Ballard Canyon),"This blend of 70% Roussanne and 30% Viognier from one of the young appellation's newer vineyards is a white Rhône done right, balancing restraint with ripeness.

8585,Margerum 2015 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Light and crystalline in the glass, this snappy bottling shows ripe cranberry fruit, thyme and composting violets on the dynamic nose.

8596,Bonny Doon 2014 Le Cigare Blanc Reserve White (Central Coast),"There's a compellingly nutty warmth to the nose of this reserve blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, with pecan and cashew aromas as well as more tart scents of key lime peels and lemon mousse. It lands heavily on the palate with roasted banana flavors and a buttery midpalate, but it is cut immediately by a kumquat tartness. Fascinating sipper.",48.0,93,1,0.999695852416706

Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling.",18.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8627,Maybach 2010 Materium Red (Oakville),"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, although it doesn't say so on the label. The wine is awesome and impeccable in the modern Oakville style of intensely ripe fruit and sweet, soft tannins. The flavors of raspberries, cherries, cocoa and sweet oak are incredibly delicious.

8629,No Girls 2010 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The No Girls Grenache, from a vineyard adjacent to Armada (the source for the Cayuse God Only Knows Grenache) is lighter, more elegant, perhaps brighter than its companion wine, with fresh blueberry and other pie berry  fruits, a streak of umami, herbal tea and impressive minerality.

8633,Blackbird Vineyards 2011 Illustration Red (Napa Valley),"Based on Merlot, this Right Bank-style Bordeaux blend has rich, instantly likeable flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, green olives and violets.

8657,Macari 2010 Block E White (North Fork of Long Island),"Streaks of sweet cream and caramel accent delicate peach and apricot tones in this Chardonnay-dominant ice-style wine. Plush and yielding, it may come off a bit confected, but it's appealing nonetheless.",40.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

8701,Envy 2007 Envy Estate Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Very ripe, to the point of overripe. The blackberries and black currants veer into raisins, and there's a hint of raisinskin tartness that, combined with the strong tannins, adds to the tough mouthfeel. Will probably soften with age, without necessarily gaining complexity.",45.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8707,Vin du Lac 2008 LEHM Sauvignon Blanc (Chelan County),"This shows the sharper, more herbaceous side of the grape, though perhaps without being fully ripe. It seems to fall away quickly into simple lemon juice flavors, with a hint of herb.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

8733,Roth 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Tingling acidity wraps around a core of pear and peach fruit in this well-integrated, layered and lush wine. The oak is quiet through the entry and midpalate, picking up power and weight on the finish. Lovely on its own, it's also a good choice for the table.",15.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8734,Saxon Brown 2010 Fighting Brothers Cuvée Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Powerful black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors seem to infuse this full-bodied wine with lots of fruit energy. It tastes vivid and unique because of that deep vein of black fruit impressions, and stays balanced by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins in spite of its alcoholic strength.",38.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8736,Watermill 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Aromas of café au lait, woodspice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, hedonistic coffee flavors. The style is rich, mixing fruit and barrel.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8738,Valdez 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This soft, subdued wine is pervasive in barbecue smoke, black licorice and toasted marshmallow. It's made from mostly Zinfandel, with smaller pockets of Petite Sirah and Carignane. Intense, especially toward the finish, it finds a thread of acidity in the background to lift itself up.",30.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8740,W.T. Vintners 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This Rocks District offering has aromas of black pepper and stems, seeming a bit locked up at the moment. Flavors are palate-staining with smoked meat and assorted herbs along with a lightly tacky feel.",45.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8741,Adelaida 2013 Version White Anna's Vineyard White (Adelaida District),"A tremendously focused blend of 42% Roussanne, 42% Viognier and 16% Grenache Blanc, this offers aromas framed by a steely minerality, as well as peach and a touch of pecan marzipan. It's light on the palate, with nectarine and ripe green apple elements.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8743,Amici 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Spring Mountain District),"Entirely barrel-fermented in 20% new French oak, this 100% varietal wine is complex and weighty. It holds a bite of ripe apple at its core, with accents of pineapple and tropical guava. Rich on the palate, it's also soft and seamless, a good choice for the table.",40.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8753,Bellwether 2014 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Delicate swathes of honey brighten savory chestnut, smoke and mineral tones throughout this feather-light dry Riesling. It's an earthier slightly darker expression of Riesling with electric acidity accenting hints of spice and dusty pollen. The finish is long and intently smoky.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8756,Cielo 2012 Malibu Estate Syrah (Saddle Rock-Malibu),"Dried berry, leather, cola, and herb notes show on the nose of this bottling from the mountains between the Conejo Valley and Malibu Coast. The flavors are savory at first—all crushed anise and mint—but grow fruitier as it opens, suggesting dark strawberry, blueberry, vanilla and clove. Quite quaffable.",100.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8761,Silver Thread 2015 Doyle Fournier Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Pretty orange blossom notes morph into zesty white grapefruit and lime in this exceptionally light off-dry Riesling. It's delicately concentrated on the palate but offers loads of invigorating, waterfall-like refreshment.",26.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8762,Standing Stone 2015 Old West Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Sunny orange and apricot aromas are accented with hints of smoke and nuts on the nose of this spry dry Riesling. The palate turns a shade zestier, suggesting cutting grapefruit and lemon dusted with pollen. It finishes long and clean.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8774,Adastra 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",40.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8788,Dry Creek Vineyard 2005 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun. The wine is impressive in ripe blackberries, currants, licorice and cocoa, but maintains a beautiful structure, with soft, fine tannins and just-in-time acidity.",34.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8789,JLC 2004 Spofford Station Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",36.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8790,Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking.",42.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
8804,Spicy Vines 2013 Dragon's Kiss Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023.",35.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8807,Foxen 2013 Tinaquaic Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"From the winery's dry-farmed vineyard comes this bottling with seamlessly integrated aromas of boysenberry, black-pepper sauce and black sesame. A tarry character kicks off the palate and then evolves into roasted lamb with lavender-pepper crust, dried mint and tarragon flavors. A soft and deftly sewn acidity hums throughout the sip.",48.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8821,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2010 Great Oak Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Dense and chewy at first, this deliciously brooding wine is all about black licorice, berry and meat. Contoured layers of integrated tannin give it an understated elegance and sense of class despite its wild power and body.",32.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
8823,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This lively, 100% Sauvignon Blanc sports fresh flavors of grapefruit, lemon meringue and quinine—much like a cool-climate Viognier. Racy and fresh, it was mostly stainless-steel fermented, and is young enough to capture a bit of spritz in the mouthfeel.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8832,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2004 O.M.O. Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8838,Scotto Family Cellars 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This is a supersmooth, easy-going wine with mild dark-fruit flavors, very little tannin and a soft texture. Two years aging in previously used oak barrels helped round off any corners in the mouthfeel.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8846,Left Bend 2014 Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's a good array of purple-flower aromas, including lavender and potpourri, on the nose of this bottling, as well as light cola and plum skins. The sip is quite bitter and tarry though, with just a touch of riper black fruit.",38.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8848,McGregor 2016 Muskat Ottonel (Finger Lakes),"The nose on this dry, aromatic wine is buoyantly peachy, accented by hints of sweet pineapple and guava. The palate is fresh and fruity as well, but less concentrated. Light bodied and brisk, it finishes with a touch of bitterness.",20.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8849,:Nota Bene 2013 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This combines 73% Grenache, 16% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre from Stone Tree, Arianses, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Its vanilla, pencil box, green herb, raspberry and purple fruit aromas are followed by quite sweet, ripe, full-bodied red and black fruit flavors. The balance seems off.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8855,Fulkerson 2016 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Subtle green tones of fresh herb, lime and apple persist from nose to finish on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. It's earthy and herbaceous but quite elegant. Zippy acidity carries a pristine, refreshing finish.",13.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
8856,Fulkerson 2016 Juicy Sweet Estate Diamond (Finger Lakes),"Candied peach, melon and grape notes are sweet and simple in this fruity white wine. Made from Diamond, a Concord-grape hybrid, with just a splash of Riesling, it's forward and easy but finishes with a crush of sweet-tart citrus. Drink now.",10.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

8866,Trenza 2012 Mosaico Red (San Luis Obispo County),"This blends cool-climate Syrah (50%) from the Edna Valley with warmer-site Petite Sirah (45%) and Grenache (5%) and shows candied cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cedar aromas. Tangy black plum and raspberry notes lead the palate, underpinned by chewy tannins.",33.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
8869,Wellington 2012 Victory Reserve Meritage (Sonoma County),"This big-shouldered blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot offers soft waves of black fruit and smoky oak. It's accented with meatier elements of brick and tobacco.",60.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
8902,Paix Sur Terre 2015 The Golden Road Yankowski Weeks Vineyard Monastrell,"Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 2019–2030.",52.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
8908,Galerie 2016 Terracea Riesling (Spring Mountain District),"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish.",35.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
8920,Tildio 2005 Profundo Red Wine Red (Wahluke Slope),"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8929,Kunde 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.",22.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8931,Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Michele Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",55.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8933,Handley 2006 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"So rich, so honeyed, with an oily texture, this Gewurz is simply wonderful. It shows powerfully ripe peach, pineapple, pear, honeysuckle, lemon cream and dusty spicebox flavors. With balancing acidity, it's California Gewurz at its most charming.",18.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
8936,Camaraderie 2005 Elegánce Meek Vineyard Red Red (Yakima Valley),"Ignore that misplaced accent over the ‘a' and focus on the excellent wine in the bottle. With Cabernet dominating., this wine is sleek and spicy, with a marked impression of graphite and gun metal. Although in general the '05 vintage is tilted more toward the ripe side of the spectrum, this wine retains a lean and elegant precision.",35.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8940,Ironstone 2012 Obsession Red (Lodi),"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",15.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8946,McClean 2010 Clemence Red (Paso Robles),"A solid deal for the price, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc presents aromas of pine forest, damp caves and black cherry. The blueberry juice flavors fade fast, leaving black sage on the finish. The tannins are ready to drink now.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8949,Navarro 2012 Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Uncomplicated yet tasty, this medium-bodied, mild-textured wine has a pure raspberry/strawberry character from the bright aroma to the ripe flavors to the lingering finish. The balance is on the soft side due to low acidity and little astringency from tannins.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8963,Chloe 2012 Red No. 249 Red (North Coast),"Made in a firm, dry style that will appeal to Cabernet drinkers, this smells like black cherries and blackberries and tastes full and fruity. It feels moderately tannic, well-balanced, and lingers a bit on the finish.",17.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
8965,Kana 2006 Old Vines Red (Yakima Valley),"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate—what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8968,McDermaid 2007 McDermaid Family Vineyard Malbec (Red Hills Lake County),"Good price for a dry, lusty Malbec that shows the variety's huge fruit, in a balanced, elegant package. While it's very tannic, the wine is softly drinkable now for its vast wealth of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8976,Milbrandt 2006 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8977,Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",37.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8981,Seven Hills 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Smoky and savory, with sharp acidity under black cherry fruit. It's still pulling itself together, but the weight and balance are there, showing hints of tobacco leaf, mint and herb.",22.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
8983,Robert Mondavi 2010 To Kalon Vineyard I Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville),"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",75.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8993,David Fulton 2010 Petite Sirah (St. Helena),"Made from 100% Petite Sirah grown in the estate vineyard, this is a massive wine. It's as big as Petite gets, filled with blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, black currant and new oak flavors. So ripe, it turns porty in the finish, but it's a good portiness, rich and heady. The official alcohol is 14.9%, but it tastes higher than that.",48.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8997,Foxen 2012 Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Santa Maria Valley),"Chenin Blanc is a difficult variety to get right in California, but few wineries do it better than Foxen. They have a solid track record, going back for years, of wrestling the wine's difficulties into elegant submission. With the 2012 vintage, Foxen has crafted one of their best ever. It's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp in acidity, with complex peach, citrus, green apple, wax bean and herb flavors.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
8998,Adelsheim 2012 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Chehalem Mountains),"One of the finer Pinot Blancs from Oregon, this vineyard-designate has a lighter mouthfeel than the winery's Pinot Gris, yet in some ways shows more complexity and overall appeal. Fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon carry a touch of almond. The bracing minerality extends through the finish.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9016,Glenora 2012 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Fresh pear and lemon aromas are brightened with hints of white florals on this brisk, medium-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it's juicy on the palate with concentrated white peach flavors accented with honey and tea notes. It's an elegant yet easy quaffer at a very reasonable price.",14.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9018,Januik 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rock solid, this substantial Merlot is grounded in earth flavors, laced with butter cookie, and finished with tart tannins. The fruit is tight and tangy.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9020,Lamoreaux Landing 2012 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Lavish blossom, peach and tropical fruit notes perfume this big-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it fills the palate with rich stone fruit and pineapple accented with peppery spice and tangerine acidity. It's a powerful yet nicely balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the finish.",15.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9021,MacLaren 2011 Samantha's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Ripely opulent, it's explosive in blackberry jam and red currants, with the grilled meat bone and black pepper notes of a cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are strong, but finely ground, while the acids will cut right through meat fat. Give this lovely young wine until 2016–2017 in the cellar.",40.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9024,Andrew Will 2011 Two Blondes Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),"In a cool vintage this site brings out more herbal components, here verging on flavors of green bean. But it pulls itself together with pretty berries, toasty oak, and a gentle streak of milk chocolate. The blend is 38% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Cabernet Franc.",55.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9025,Barnard Griffin 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatic and fruity, this is front-loaded with pretty accents of toast and baking spices. There's 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, but it's Merlot's show, with forward, smooth, chocolaty goodness around a core of raspberry candy.",17.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9035,Orsi Family Vineyards 2013 Sangiovese (Dry Creek Valley),"This small-production Tuscan-inspired wine shows sour cherry fruit and a funky note of peat. Low in oak and tannin, it's softly layered and slightly salty, appealing in its Old World style.",28.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9040,Kontokosta 2013 Anemometer White (North Fork of Long Island),"This rich cream-textured blend of Chardonnay and Viognier evokes warming pastry notes of vanilla, caramel and crème brûlée.

9041,Atwater 2013 Big Blend Red (Finger Lakes),"This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9045,Terlato 2013 Cardinals' Peak Red (Napa Valley),"This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage.",50.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

9060,Peachy Canyon 2010 Snow Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is Peachy Canyon's 100% Zinfandel, unblended, and it's a true expression of the variety, Paso Robles style. That means it's softly voluptuous and almost to the point of overripeness, with blackberry, raisin and spice flavors. Drink now.",36.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9062,Samsara 2009 Larner Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A ripe red wine, brimming with cherry fruit, and heightened in texture by acidity. Not particularly complex, but rich and satisfying, making it one of the better Grenaches from California.",36.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

9074,Dutton Estate 2010 Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"This is Dutton Estate's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc. It did not go through the malolactic fermentation, but it started as very ripe grapes, so what you get is pure citrus, Asian pear, white peach and green apple flavor, zesty and clean in acidity, with slight a sweetness in the finish. Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9082,Fenestra 2009 Graciano (Lodi),"Livermore Valley-based Fenestra loves to source fun stuff from Lodi, and Graciano has proven to like Lodi very much. In Fenestra's hands this varietal is soft and round, perfectly fine drinking, a taste of Bing cherry in liquid form.",25.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9085,Due Vigne 2007 Musso Family Vineyard Dolcetto (El Dorado County),"Grown at 2,400-feet elevation from Italian budwood, this Dolcetto, so common to Piedmont but almost unheard of in California, is muy grande, with mountainous tannins and flavors of coffee and toffee and bright notes of cranberry and cherry.",19.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9087,Glenora 2010 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Sweet on the nose, with scents of pink grapefruit skin, rose petals and lychee fruit, Glenora's bottling screams classic Gewürztraminer. Waxy lanolin notes and black tea notes on the finish add a touch of complexity to this slightly off-dry sip.",15.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9088,Hard Row To Hoe 2010 Marsanne (Yakima Valley),"Waxy fruit flavors of peach, melon and banana, all a bit understated, lead through a light and pleasant quaffer with a hint of toast on the finish.",18.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9089,Animale 2009 Dolcetto (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This alcoholic wine (15.9%, and you can taste it) is also tongue-scrapingly tannic. The black cherry and cassis fruit is fabulous, and quite ripe, but the alcohol starts to burn out the finish. Let the record show that some tasters will love this wine.",24.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9092,Beresan 2008 The Buzz Yellow Jacket Vineyard Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Light fruit flavors run from melon into pale strawberry, with tannins that seem just on the edge of ripeness. Pleasant for the near term, but not for cellaring.",19.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9093,Cabot Vineyards 2007 Syrah (Humboldt County),"From husband-and-wife team in California redwood country, comes this interesting Syrah, sourced from dry-farmed estate vines. Smelling of cedar pine and red fruit, it's very savory, full of pepper and leather, dark coffee and espresso. Lay it down another year or so to tame its wild soul.",24.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9099,McGregor 2010 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note.",18.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9102,Murrieta's Well 2010 The Whip White Wine White (Livermore Valley),"Murrieta's blend of 31% Sauvignon Blanc, 27% Viognier, 15% Sémillon, 11% Pinot Blanc, 8% Orange Muscat and 8% Muscat Canellii is well-made and likable, medium-thick and somewhat sweet in style with citrus and almond accents. Delightfully quaffable.",19.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9103,Ott & Murphy 2009 Double Bluff Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This pretty, Rhône-style red blend consists of roughly equal parts Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah, with a splash of co-fermented Roussanne. It smells young and fruity, with candied scents of strawberry and raspberry. With plenty of breathing it gains a bit of midpalate weight, but the candied character remains.",19.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9106,Rock Wall 2009 Holbrook Mitchell Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Tastes hot and prickly in alcohol, which puts everything else off, including the black cherry, bacon, olive and herb flavors, which are actually pretty good. Drink now.",32.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9140,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Co-fermented with Viognier (for the first time at Ste. Michelle), this aims for a brighter, softer style of Syrah. It's plenty soft, pleasantly accessible, and lightly toasty. The smoothness seems to have eliminated some of the brightness, the hills and valleys that make Syrah so distinctive in Washington.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9141,Chateau Walla Walla 2008 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A big and oaky style, liquorous and full-flavored from the start. This is spot-on varietally, the fruit sourced from the Zerba Vineyards, and has a nice run through the midpalate with purple berry fruits and plenty of new oak. It turns a little chalky in the finish.",40.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9142,Coeur d'Alene 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pleasant red fruits awash in chocolaty oak craft an accessible, broadly open Syrah. Though it seems a bit generic, it is balanced and tasty; a good bottle for near-term drinking with simple grilled meats.",28.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9153,Tudal 2010 Honker Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc this nice to pair with food. It's basically dry, although you'll find a honeyed richness around the lemon, lime and green apple flavors, as well as plenty of savory acidity that gets those tastebuds watering.",14.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9168,Handley 1995 Blanc de Blancs  (Anderson Valley),"From one of California’s coolest growing regions, the grapes nonetheless achieved the ripeness of white peaches, lending those notes to the aromas and flavors. It’s very clean and refreshing. There’s a nice toastiness that carries through to the finish, which is slightly sweet and bitter. To be released Spring 2001.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9176,Joseph Phelps 2014 Eisrébe Scheurebe (Napa Valley),"Floral in jasmine and orange blossom, this is a sultry, full-bodied after-dinner sipper, lilting in honey goodness yet light in stone fruit and layered acidity. It is enjoyable on its own but would be fabulous alongside a peach pie or apricot tart.",50.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9180,Lumos 2014 Temperance Hill Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Oregon),"This dry, single-vineyard bottling is extremely aromatic, as only Gewürztraminer can be. The ripe lychee and grapefruit is subsumed in a cloud of baby powder. It's quite dry, and for those that want a supremely floral varietal expression of this grape, this is your go-to bottle.",19.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9183,Plaisance Ranch 2012 Papa Joe's Private Stash Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Grown in a rather cool part of the Applegate Valley AVA, this offers aromatics of cured meat, peppery herb and a dash of iron ore.

9185,Ravenswood 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This sophisticated, dry and affordable wine will shine at mealtime due to its balance between generous fruit flavors and an appetizing, moderately tannic texture. Aromas resemble raspberries and red cherries, while flavors are a bit riper than that. The acidity is lively and the finish lingers.",14.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9195,Cinnabar 2012 Burbank Vineyard Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"This presents a rather fresh take on this often extracted grape, with raspberry and boysenberry juice, black pepper, dried strawberries and a touch of wild mint. There are nice coffee elements on the palate, along with sage and brown spices, but the boysenberry and fresh purple fruits shine throughout.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9203,Asuncion Ridge 2010 Nefarious Red (Paso Robles),"With flavors of black pepper, sweet charred meat, blackberry jam and toasty oak, this is a seriously good wine, reminiscent of the Northern Rhône. There's a streak of tart red cherries and cola that make this luscious wine enjoyable now.",36.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9222,Bell 2008 Canterbury Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Tannic and brooding in its big-boned structure, this high-elevation-grown Syrah will please Cabernet Sauvignon drinkers in its upfront oak and herb overtones. But it remains true to its varietal roots, offering bright Bing cherry, black plum and licorice, complete with loads of earthiness and ground pepper.",36.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9223,Bodega Rancho 2009 Vivio Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Power marks this gigantic Syrah. What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for with its sheer size. Syrah doesn't get much riper in blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. With its thick, rich tannins, drink it soon with beef and game dishes.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9224,Tercero 2008 Larner Vineyard Cuvée Loco Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is big, rich, thick wine, dripping with gooey cherry and chocolate flavors. Blended from equal parts Grenache and Syrah, it features some notable tannins, although it's voluptuous enough to drink now. Pair it with barbecue.",30.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9225,Veritas 2010 Vintner's Reserve Red (Monticello),"Decidely savory on the nose, aromas of bacon, brûléed sugar, grilled herb and toast highlight the black fruit core. The palate is meaty and currently locked tight with superfirm, grippy tannins. Bone dry on the finish, this should be enjoyed with a chunk of rare beef to help tame the tannic blow.",35.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9231,Sineann 2010 Abondante Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A witch's brew of five grapes, the Abondante is a fine wine to pair with pizza, offering interesting flavors of berry and stone fruit. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for with plenty of fruit and some unusual complexity.",24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9237,Northstar 2008 Stella Maris Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.",29.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9238,Artezin 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"High on the deliciousness-factor, this shows soft, seemingly sweet flavors of raspberry, cinnamon, smoky butter, sugar cookie and vanilla. It's a little one-dimensional, but that dimension is a nice one. Drink now.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9239,Bargetto 2009 Regan Vineyards Reserve Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This wine displays the aggressive acidity typical of Central Coast Merlots. While it's rich and dry in raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a fine note of smoky oak, the tartness is central. Pairing this with ham will help tame the acids.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9242,Shypoke 2008 Charbono (Calistoga),"Charbono is an old-fashioned grape that almost nobody makes anymore, but Shypoke is giving it some love, and good for them. This is a really nice wine. It's as full-bodied, dry and tannic as a Merlot, but with different flavors, of black cherries, grilled meats and mushu plum sauce, with dusty exotic spices and a touch of funky smoke. It's soft enough to drink now.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9244,Clos du Val 2009 Ariadne Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc is bone dry and sophisticated, with a bite of acidity that makes it exceptionally food friendly. Made with just a touch of oak, it's marked by brisk flavors of lemons, limes, green apples and Asian pears, with a hint of tart gooseberry. A mouthwateringly clean wine that's great as a cocktail sipper with little appetizers.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9245,Viento 2009 Pine Grove Vineyard Vintage Select Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price.",20.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9247,Lachini 2009 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Lovely scents suggest citrus rind, lemon cake, honeycomb, candied orange and more. Substantial fruit flavors run from lime on through ripe pineapple, and the supporting structure offers a firm foundation of acid and extract, with a pleasingly long finish.",22.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9258,Cinnabar 2008 Mercury Rising Red (California),"A blend of the five major Bordeaux varieties, this is a deliciously soft wine. So easy to like for its rich blackberry, cherry, raspberry and smoky oak flavors, courtesy of 40% new barrels. Shows lots of class for the price.",21.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9261,Donelan 2008 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"A tough, tannic young wine that will benefit from two or three years in the bottle, but probably no more. It's bone dry and astringent now, with an intense core of blackberries, grilled meat and black pepper. Give it a few hours in a decanter before pouring.",45.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9272,Convergence Zone 2009 Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea.",15.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9278,Croma Vera 2015 Spanish Springs Vineyard Albariño (San Luis Obispo County),"Fresh-squeezed grapefruit, pomelo, Key lime, lemongrass, green papaya and Anjou pear combine for a very green, fruit-driven nose on this bottling from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach. The palate is a tad ripe but shows apple soda, lime juice, cherimoya and apple-custard flavors.",26.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9287,Almquist 2010 Vintner's Select Konnowac Vineyard Petit Verdot (Washington),"Light aromas of flowers, herbs and soil are followed by tart cranberry, smoke and citrus flavors and firm, gritty tannins. It doesn't stand up by itself but has a place at the dinner table alongside a juicy steak.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9288,Almquist 2010 Vintner's Select Tinto Doce Upland Vineyard Red (Washington),"The aromas are surprisingly reserved, with notes of vanilla, spice and brown sugar. The palate provides brown-sugar and purple-fruit flavors, with the vanilla notes from the oak riding high. Coffee flavors persist on the finish.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9290,Burnt Bridge 2013 Blend X Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is two-thirds Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Mesquite, dark cherry, vanilla, herb and spice aromas lead to tart, tingly flavors with bunched up tannins.",40.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9296,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Dry Rosé Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Candied cherry and berry aromas abound on the nose of this dry rosé, but the palate is surprisingly elegant. Pristine red cherry and raspberry flavors are fresh and bright, accented by savory, slightly bitter hints that lend nuance to the finish.",22.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9297,Hensteeth 2010 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County),"Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot come together to form an herbal, medium-bodied wine that drinks lean. Cedar, black tar and leather meet black pepper and chocolate while the tannins remain tight and firm.",49.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9298,Indigené 2013 Philanthropist Red (Carmel Valley),"A strong boysenberry fruit character is spiced by anise, graphite, cedar and Dr Pepper notes on this bottling. The palate shows light red currant, ripe plum, mulberrry and strawberry, with a touch of pencil shavings adding complexity.",21.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9299,J & J 2013 Les Collines Vineyard Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas are light, with the notes of green herbs, flowers and plum, leaning pretty far into the green and savory. The flavors are plump and soft, with the concentration at times seeming faint.",35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9301,Latah Creek 2015 Hyatt Vineyard Muscat Canelli (Rattlesnake Hills),"Bright aromas of flowers and orange rind lead to perfumed, lightly spritzy sweet fruit flavors. Enjoy it as an apéritif.",11.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9307,Schramsberg 2009 Blanc de Blancs Brut Sparkling (Napa-Sonoma-Marin),"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this bubbly shows Schramsberg's ease of producing rich, clean and elegant sparkling wines. It's delicious now in vanilla, yeast, lime and Asian pear flavors, with some sweetness from the dosage, but try giving it 5–6 years in the cellar.",37.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9308,Turley 2010 Fredericks Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"While this Zin is high in alcohol, which gives it some peppery heat, it's dry and complex. The flavors range from ripe blackberry, blueberry and currant to dark chocolate, licorice and warm-climate Zin spice. The vineyard contains 80-year-old vines, grown in the mountains above the valley floor, which explains the wine's unique concentration.",42.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9309,Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe—nearly overripe—with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",35.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9313,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A marvelous effort in a difficult year, this textbook Washington Riesling is bursting with apricot and peach goodness. Round and polished, it's long and textured, with an excellent wash of minerality.",9.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9318,Saggi 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"More Sangiovese (62%) is in the blend this year, with Cabernet and Syrah filling out the rest. It's dark and smoky, featuring an intriguing flavor mix of spun sugar and black cherry. It seems to hit a firm wall of toast and char that rounds out with some hours of breathing time. Certainly one of the best Saggi offerings to date.",45.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9319,Scheid Vineyards 2008 Isabelle Sparkling (Monterey),"This is a brut-style bubbly, made from roughly equal parts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

9320,Vina Robles 2011 White4 White (Paso Robles),"This is an interesting wine that pushes the boundaries beyond the usual offerings in California. Blended from Viognier, Vermentino, Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc, it's dry, tart and complex, with a broad range of citrus, white peach, dried apricot and white pepper flavors. Don't serve it too cold.",16.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9322,K Vintners 2009 The Boy Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah from the Armada Vineyard, this expresses its characteristic mix of superripe fruit and organic funk. Cracker, berry, spice and earth components all seem to compete a bit in the mouth and need more bottle time to fully meld together.",50.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9329,Doyenne 2011 Roussanne (Red Mountain),"Sourced exclusively from the Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, this pure Roussanne is fragrant with bright scents of apple and citrus. The fruit is set in an elegant frame of mineral-infused acids, and it stretches out on the palate into a lengthy, polished, refreshing finish.",34.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9332,Reustle 2014 Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Umpqua Valley),"This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9337,Stephen Ross 2013 Jespersen Ranch Grenache (Edna Valley),"Rounded plum and berry aromas grow more complex thanks to hints of sarsparilla bark, rose buds, cinnamon stick and nutmeg on the nose of this cool-climate bottling. The palate is quite peppery, with dried red flowers, red plums, peppercorns, strawberries and a texturally earthy core of fine-grained tannins.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9339,Terre Rouge 2013 DTR Ranch Syrah (Fiddletown),"This is a very solid, well-structured and deeply flavorful wine from the first whiff of blackberries and black pepper to the mouth-coating but dry flavors to the lingering spicy finish. Best to drink after 2018.",40.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9340,The Withers Winery 2013 Ruben Red (El Dorado),"This is a well-balanced, handsomely composed wine that is big in flavor and full in body. The aromas are spicy like black pepper and cardamom, the flavors are meaty, peppery, smoky and berry-like, for a great taste experience that goes way beyond the usual. It's made mostly from Mourvèdre grapes, with Syrah and Grenache in supporting roles.",38.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9344,Joseph Filippi 2010 Velluto Red (Cucamonga Valley),"Strong cola, fresh pomegranate, pressed strawberry and dried spearmint notes show on the nose of this blend of 40% Tempranillo, 32% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from east of Los Angeles. Very intriguing, extremely minty flavors pop on the palate, spicing up the baked blueberry and meaty beef elements.",29.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9349,Duckhorn 2011 The Discussion Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a sizable addition of Merlot and smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, The Discussion is lovely in spicy black pepper and clove, full bodied and softly integrated in terms of tannin and oak. A brightness of red fruit shines through, along with a distinct taste of fig.",135.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9354,West of Temperance 2012 Aglianico (California),"Baked mulberry, light clove spice, cola and gingerbread show on the intriguingly distinctive and delicious nose of this bottling from a boutique producer.

9357,Naggiar 2012 Le Grand Pere Estate Reserve Red (Sierra Foothills),"Judicious use of new oak meets gorgeous fruit flavors in this generous, warm and softly tannic wine.

9376,Stottle 2007 Nebbiolo (Horse Heaven Hills),"Pure Nebbiolo from the Elerding Vineyard, aged 40 months in a mix of French and American oak. Nebbiolo does not have much color to begin with, and this seems a bit washed out, with acids and barrel flavors overtaking the fruit. Astringent and aggressively oaky.",42.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
9379,Earthquake 2010 Zinfandel (Lodi),"No doubt Michael-David is going for a certain style with Earthquake, describing it as “over the top and shattering to the veins.” Indeed. This Lodi Zin will knock your socks and several other pieces of clothing off with its smoky, greasy, hot and sweet berry pie flavors, with a side of bacon to boot. True to its style, this is one very big boy.",26.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
9381,Artisan Uprising 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"The aromas of boysenberry, black pepper and roasting game are reminiscent of Syrah in this tasty bottling from brother-vintners David and William Vondrasek. The palate offers a lot of zing, followed by flavors of tobacco ash, olallieberry and peppery bacon.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9402,Deer Creek 2014 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"There has been an impressive jump in quality over the past few vintages, along with a price drop. What's not to like? This young, lightly spritzy wine is a fresh summer drink with immense appeal. Scents of white flowers, flavors of pears and highlights of tangerines, continue into further flavors of pink grapefruit and clean rock. The low alcohol suggests that there is a touch of residual sugar, but the wine finishes dry.",14.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9406,Espana Robles 2012 Red (Paso Robles),"Though obscure in America, this Tempranillo-Grenache blend is not uncommon in Spain, and the results are solid. Thick aromas of plum extract, black pepper, fudge and tobacco lead into a rich and luxurious mouthfeel. Ripe flavors of boysenberry and olallieberry are cut by a very spicy edge of black pepper and mocha.",20.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9409,Chateau St. Jean 2007 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"Chateau St. Jean has a long history with Sauvignon Blanc, and this affordable wine shows their mastery of the variety. It's dry and crisply balanced, with delicious flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and honeysuckle that are brightened with crisp acidity.

9413,Navarro 2007 White (Mendocino),"This is a blend of Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Pinot Gris. This wine is deliciously balanced and, at this price, a super restaurant by-the-glass sipper. It's very crisp and fruity-spicy, and finishes a little sweet in honey vanilla. Nice by itself, or with Asian or Indian food.",13.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
9418,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Skyline Riesling (Monterey),"A wonderful Riesling, so polished and pretty.

9425,Enjoie 2007 Dry Rosé (Napa County),"A solid rosé that brings to mind bistros, steaks and pommes frites. Grenache provides the flavor background of cherries, while Barbera brings a firm spine of acidity. Finishes bone dry. A delightful and useful blush wine.",14.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9428,Wrath 2010 Ex Anima Syrah (Monterey),"Very strongly flavored, and needs a salty cut of meat to tame its powers. Explodes with jammy blackberries, blueberries, cherries and raspberries, with a monster blast of black pepper. Bring on the sausages.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

9431,Seven Hills 2010 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Evergreen vineyard fruit and old-vine Riesling sourced from a pair of Yakima Valley vineyards, this feels drier than its 1.8% residual sugar.

9479,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2016 White Zinfandel (California),"This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol.",8.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

9486,Gray Ghost 2015 Petit Verdot (Virginia),Aromas of mushroom and cedar are overpowered by cherry in the form of cough drops and Kool-Aid.

9493,Horton 2015 Petit Manseng (Virginia),"This wine starts on intense aromas of charred oak and roasted nuts. It eventually gives way to stone fruits and marmalade that, while soft on the nose, are stronger on the fruit-forward palate. Nutty flavors and rough oak seem out of place among the fresh fruit and viscous mouthfeel, and makes for a long yet disjointed finish.",25.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

9530,Auclair 2013 Artz Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Red Mountain),"With a healthy whack of Merlot (22%), this drinks a bit more like a Bordeaux blend than a varietal wine. It enchants with aromas of high-toned herbs, coffee, toasty oak and red cherry. The cherry and black fruit flavors are layered and tightly wound, with a pleasing mouthfeel. The tannins need time to unwind.",42.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9531,Auclair 2013 Right Blend Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Merlot (73%), Cabernet Franc (24%) and Petit Verdot, it rises from the glass with aromas of cedar, flowers and red and black fruit.

9551,Wild Coyote 2009 Bragger Syrah (Paso Robles),"Very peppery even for Syrah. Marked also by intense blackberry jam flavors, it's a full-bodied, tannic bruiser, but one with brooding depth. Decant it a few hours before serving.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

9577,Maryhill 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Herbal and earthy, this dry and tannic wine shows almost no hint of ripe fruit. It might be best with a burger or skirt steak to absorb the tannins.",17.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
9580,Des Voigne Cellars 2008 Montreux Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A somewhat volatile nose introduces a wine that has a powerfully oaky flavor, perhaps from the 30 months it spent in 50% new American barrels. It seems a bit overdone, and the fruit heads into dry, pruny flavors. It is seemingly already past its prime.",30.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
9598,Ballentine 2012 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah.

9606,Margerum 2012 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This annually anticipated bottling offers a blend of Doug Margerum's top barrels from a variety of vineyards. In this vintage, aromas of baking spice and red fruit come with minty sagebrush lift.

9614,Longboard 2011 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021.",29.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9618,Aratás 2010 Shake Ridge Petite Sirah (Amador County),"This has a very deep color, even for this notoriously dark varietal.

9622,Burbank Ranch 2012 Hidden Path Estate Grown Malbec (Paso Robles),"Aromas of cooked red cherry, blackberry liqueur and smoke waft from the glass.

9631,Mumm Napa 2002 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"DVX is Mumm Napa's top of the line vintage bottling. This '02 is a 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, making it a brut. It's very high in acidity, and the bubbles are tiny and refined, giving it the ultra-smooth mouthfeel you want in a superior sparkling wine. The raspberry, lime and pear flavors are rich, but subtle, reined in by yeastiness and a tangy minerality. Drink this luxurious bubbly now and over the next 10 years.",55.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
9632,Novy 2008 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Syrah master Novy has given us a beautiful Syrah to drink now with rich lamb, beef and pork dishes, or perhaps a Latin-inspired black bean soup. It's rich, softly lush and dry, and the blackberry, currant, mocha and sandalwood flavors have exciting edges of salty cured meats and freshly crushed black pepper. Really exquisite, but only 263 cases were produced.",33.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
9639,Rodney Strong 2007 Symmetry Red Meritage (Alexander Valley),"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak. The blackberry, cherry, red currant, mocha and bacon flavors are delicious, but even better is the tannic structure. It's soft and alluring enough to drink now.",55.0,94,1,0.999695852416706

9666,Paraduxx 2010 Z Blend Red (Napa Valley),"Each of the three varieties in the blend brings its own unique contribution. Zinfandel, the majority, gives spicy wild-berry flavors and robust body.

9675,Bonair 2013 Chateau Puryear Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills),"This wine's cranberry, orange peel and herb notes are atypical for the variety.

9689,Cedar View Winery 2014 Petite Sirah (California),"This wine smells extra ripe, like raisins and black figs, and tastes rich, chocolaty and almost fat in texture.

9707,Stephen & Walker 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A little soft, but the spices make up for that, creating a tingly mouthfeel of pepper, anise and clove. That's in addition to the ripe wild blackberry, cherry and mulberry flavors, finished with a splash of tabasco. Great with teriyaki beef or pork.",35.0,90,1,0.999695852416706

9727,Summers 2010 Four Acre Zin Zinfandel (Calistoga),"A seriously good Zin that preserves the variety's brambly, briary wild berry and spice personality, yet crafts it with true Napa elegance. The core of cola and cherry pie is sweet, yet the finish is wonderfully dry.",34.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9735,Mumm Napa 2008 Devaux Ranch Sparkling (Napa Valley),"For a 100% Chardonnay, this is remarkably complex. It shows orange, lime, vanilla, toast and sourdough flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The mousse is very refined, giving it a mouthfeel of pure silk. Try giving it 5–6 years in the cellar.",38.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9738,Seven Hills 2011 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Casey McClellan blended 15% Merlot into this vintage—the most ever—and has crafted a bright, sappy wine with vivid flavors of spiced apples and raspberries.

It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes.

9821,Château Bianca 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This offers fresh flavors of pear fruit, with a lightly fleshy mouthfeel. The length and balance are in proportion. Drink now through 2018.",12.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9830,Carr 2009 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied. It has the silkiness of a Pinot Noir, and it's dry and complex in wild berry, leather, black pepper and cedar flavors. It shows lots of elegance throughout, and could even pick up bottle notes over the next six years.",50.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9845,Sidecar 2015 G-Force Red (Oregon),"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up.",29.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9853,Coelho 2016 Renovação Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"In Coelho's revamped lineup, Renovação has double the residual sugar of the entry-level Pinot Gris, clocking in at 10 g/L. Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying.",20.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9862,Heart Catcher 2014 Volcano Ridge Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Given the vineyard location, on the eastern edge of the Columbia Gorge, this is a unique take on Merlot, falling somewhere between the broad, fleshy Washington style, and the thinner, more herbal southern Oregon style. The layered flavors mix berry, citrus and red plum, in an open, easy-drinking wine that should pair well with a variety of transitional autumn entrées.",30.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9865,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Mancini Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Subdued and delicately ripe, this wine offers understated notions of leather, chocolate and blackberry bramble, with an electric undercurrent of fresh-squeezed citrus. Light and bright, this is a study in holding back, with complexity at its core.",34.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9867,Luna 2016 Minuet Sangiovese Rosé (Napa Valley),"Grapefruit peel and tart lemon combine for a memorably savory beginning to this crisp wine. This one integrates its acidity with a medium weight into a clean, dry and lengthy package of flavor and bite.",32.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
9881,Bonterra 2011 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"This Zin contains percentages of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese and Grenache, offering powerfully dusty tannins and layers of blackberry. Chewy, the finish is all leathery saddle.",16.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9885,Kenwood 2011 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Here's your basic everyday Zindandel at a good-value price. It's dry and tannic, with spicy flavors of blackberries and plums. Easy to drink, and it gains traction as as it warms in the glass.",14.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
9894,Iris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),"This AVA is a hotbed for this grape, as this ripe, robust effort demonstrates. Concentrated plum and cherry fruit has a whiff of leather, along with pretty baking spices. The tannins are substantial, and turn a bit chalky with plenty of skin flavors. Another couple of years of bottle age would be optimal.",28.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9902,Trig Point 2013 Diamond Dust Vineyard Merlot (Alexander Valley),"This is a meaty and soft wine with a lot of power behind it. Plummy, slightly jammy yet structured, it features appropriate accents of peppercorn, cedar and toasted oak. Full bodied, it's enjoyable now and a deal to boot.",19.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9903,Tyler Florence 2013 Blending Sessions Meritage (Sonoma County),"A wealth of oak and tannin marks the entry of this wine, a blend of 62% Malbec with 30% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It mellows on the midpalate, providing a more supple experience of baked plum, raspberry and coffee, finishing with a full-bodied flourish of vanillin toast.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9906,Refugio Ranch 2013 Petite Sirah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Black pepper, lavender, blueberry, blackcurrant, grapseseed and smoked game make for a heady nose on this wine from a property just south of the Sana Ynez River. The palate offers tart black fruit and elderberry jam, with just enough pepper and purple flowers to round out the sip.",38.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9910,Left Bend 2013 Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fresh and peppery in a more classic style, this bottling by Gary Robinson shows just-tanned leather, green peppercorn and herbaceous elements that border on bell pepper. Peppery zest on the palate spices up the tart red fruit and crushed thyme herbs. Chill it a tad and enjoy on a warm day.",38.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9914,Proulx 2013 Merveille Red (Paso Robles),"A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram.",42.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9916,Silver Mountain 2010 Alloy Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Savory pepper, tangy blueberry, black raspberry and pencil-shaving notes show on the nose of this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot. The cedar and graphite element carry to the palate, where tobacco, grapy fruits and dill make for an intriguing sip.",32.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9917,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 White Label Bassi VIneyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label. Black cherry, white sage and spearmint notes entice the nose, before the palate breathes in tart elderberries and black pepper, presented with tight tannins and brisk acidity.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9922,Maison Basque 1997 Black Zinfandel Zinfandel (California),"Dark, brick colored wine, heavily oxidized, with nutty, smoky, Madeira-like flavors, and thick, dry tannins. An odd, raisiny approach to Zin.",24.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
9926,Buffalo Ridge 1998 French Camp Zinfandel (Central Coast),"Simple fruit and a sweet, almost candied flavor. This wine seems unbalanced. There's an odd hole in the middle, and very little weight or tannin in the finish. It's all forward, sweet fruit, more like candy than berries.",12.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
9927,Meeker 1997 Gold Leaf Cuvee Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Plummy, ripe, beginning to oxidize. Ready to drink right now, it's got a leafy, tomato flavor to it. Unusual.",18.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
9930,Renwood 1997 Grandmére Zinfandel (Amador County),"Full blueberry and blackberry aromas can't overcome the off-putting, solvent-like elements on the nose here. Lots of alcohol, spice-cake and dark berry flavors, but not much finesse or texture mark this disappointing old-vine offering from this generally solid Zinfandel producer.",25.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
9931,Wagner 1998 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),"The more I taste Vidal, the more I find it an acquired taste—a taste I've yet to acquire. This one has intense aromas of canned creamed corn, with a few other vegetal hints thrown in for good measure. Yes, it's sweet, with balancing acidity and a rich, lush mouthfeel, but the flavors—well, let's just say they're unique.",18.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
9936,Dolce 1998 White (Napa Valley),"Ripe hay, vanilla, and apricot mark the nose; deep orange flavors with cinnamon spice notes and a very smooth mouthfeel are the already promising attributes of this infant. All the right elements are there, and in good balance. Best cellared for three to five years.",75.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
9938,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1997 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Great vineyards, great winery, great vintage: There's lots to like about this big, bold, fruity wine that manages to be complex and elegant at the same time. Masses of blackberry, black currant and violets, with smoke and vanilla from oak aging. What's hard to convey is the balance, richness, harmony and depth of flavor, which are really stunning. Age it for a few years if you want, but it's at or near its delicious best now.",35.0,93,1,0.999695852416706
9943,Kenwood 1997 Massara Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak. The tannins are soft and finely etched. Gorgeous stuff, quite lovely now, but the solid core of fruit indicates mid-term aging potential.",25.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
9948,Chalone Vineyard 1999 Pinot Blanc (Chalone),"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it.",24.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9950,Etude 1998 Pinot Blanc (Carneros),"Starts off with rich, fragrant aromas of ripe peaches, mangos and flowers, with vanilla and buttery-oaky notes. There's lots of buttercream in the mouth, along with ripe, forward tropical fruit and spice flavors and a high acidity level that creates a searing, mouthwatering quality. Good stuff.",25.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
9958,Anew 2015 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light aromas of pear, white flowers and melon lead to dry, medium-bodied fruit flavors. It doesn't bring much complexity but still offers plenty of appeal.",11.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9966,Barnstormer 2014 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Fresh blackberry and cherry aromas are cloaked in exotic shades of cocoa powder, soil and spice on the nose of this Cabernet Franc. The palate is a bit more reserved, suggesting crisp black-fruit flavors bolstered by fine tannins and a zesty acidic backbone. The finish is brisk but clean.",21.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9967,Bell 2014 Red (California),"This well-mannered, well-balanced and medium-bodied dry wine offers tasty raspberry and pomegranate flavors. Light tannins add a little grip.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9970,Irwin Family Vineyards 2013 The Mix Red (Sierra Foothills),"This is a big wine in structure, but mellow and complex in flavor as if it's been well aged. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Monastrell, it smells lightly sweet and tastes dry and inviting like vanilla, milk chocolate and raspberries.",16.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9971,Castoro Cellars 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"This wine kicks off with awesome aromatics of jasmine flowers, white beach, green tea and Rainier cherry. The palate is clean and crisp with ripe honeydew melon, Gala apple and Anjou pear flavors that are pleasant but simple.",16.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9976,Cloudlift Cellars 2015 Lucy Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"This wine is pale pink in color. Lightly reduced aromas of dried herb and cherry are followed by an elegantly styled palate, etched with orange-peel flavors. It brings intrigue but the concentration doesn't always seem all there.",16.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
9977,Camaraderie 2014 Chandler Reach Vineyard Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of cigar box, herb and cherry are followed by bright tart acid-driven cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a light astringency but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",29.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9980,Co Dinn 2014 Lonesome Spring Ranch Vineyard G-S-M (Yakima Valley),"This wine is a near equal split between three varieties: Gerenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Mesmerizing aromas of red cherry, plum, wood spice and herb are followed by quite tart elegant fruit flavors. It shows a lot of finesse but still needs some time to stretch its legs.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
9984,Heron Hill 2015 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Blossomy and fragrant from start to finish, this semisweet Riesling offers loads of spring floral freshness. Crisp apple and pear flavors are a bit lean in concentration, but sunny lemon acidity lingers brightly on the finish.",15.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10001,Wellington 2013 Estate Vineyard Grenache (Sonoma County),"Juicy and exuberantly floral, this wine is structured with a reasonable amount of tannin. Its strawberry and cherry fruit is robustly ripe, but high acidity saves the day.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10003,San Juan Vineyards 2006 Siegerrebe (Puget Sound),"Light and tart, mixing grapefruit, lychee, mineral and floral aromas, all evident here. Very spicy, it is a bit like Gewürztraminer without the floral highlights. The Brix (under 20) leads to a thin wine that doesn't quite reach 12% alcohol.",15.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10006,Château Julien 2005 Private Reserve Syrah (Monterey County),"If you're looking for a soft, sweetish wine, here's one. It has flavors of ripe red and black cherries, currants, dark chocolate, root beer and licorice, and tastes like a fruit and honey energy bar.",36.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10007,Domaine Chandon 2005 Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"This variety is commonly used in Champagne but rarely vinified on its own. This wine shows why. It's like Pinot Noir in the silky texture, but feels jagged and harsh, and the fruit tastes a little baked and sugary.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10008,Fanucchi 2005 Wood Road Vineyard Trousseau Gris (Russian River Valley),"Smells honeyed and tastes like one of those fruity bottled sodas. It's a riot of peaches, pears and vanilla cream, with a honey-sweet finish.",19.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10011,Miner 2004 Stagecoach Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Smells a little herbal-weedy, tastes a little semisweet and soft, with raisiny blackberry and cherry flavors. Ready now.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10012,Rosenblum 2005 Snows Lake Vineyard Zinfandel (Lake County),"This is a wine that's soft in structure, and while it's dry, it's hard in tannins and the fruit has a baked taste like shrivelled raisins. Not an ager.",35.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10013,San Juan Vineyards 2004 Red (Yakima Valley),"No stuffing here, just thin berry and cherry fruit and a quick hit of chocolate.",15.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10015,Vie Winery 2005 L'Imaginaire Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Not a whole lot going on in this soft, simple wine. The cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors are ultraripe, with a liqueured quality, and the finish is semisweet.",39.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10016,Vivác Winery 2005 Divino Red (New Mexico),"This unique red blend from New Mexico has a nose of candied spice and a smooth but structured character of red berry, spice and a touch of sweetness. It's not terribly complex but the flavors are good and the overall impression appealing.",22.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10018,Rosenblum 2005 Monte Rosso Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"From the pitch-black color you can tell this is an enormously extracted wine. It shows the stuffing of this famous vineyard's Zins, with blackberries, loganberries, cherries, licorice, leather and cocoa-laced coffee, and is quite tannic. But it's diminished by what tastes like notable sugar in the finish, even though the alcohol is over 15%.",45.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10019,Tertulia 2006 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Suffers from the common new winery kinds of faults. Overpriced for the competition; there are odd, off scents suggesting hay, honey, and yeast. It feels awkward on the palate, disjointed and incomplete.",18.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10020,Yellow Hawk Cellar 2004 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Good vineyard sources—Ranch at the End, Chandler Reach and Willow Crest—but the bitter, leathery flavors impact all these wines. Here it's less intrusive than in the Barbera, but it still fouls the finish with bacterial funk. Somewhere in here is some pretty cherry fruit.",19.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10021,Koenig Vineyards 2003 Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Idaho),"Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) Merlot (40%) and Cabernet Franc (5%) comprise this red blend from Idaho, named after the winemaker's son. Soft spice and berry on the nose and toast, tobacco and berry on the palate are approachable and pretty.",50.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10022,La Crema 2006 Viognier (Sonoma County),"If you “talk dry and taste sweet,” as they say, you'll like this wine. It's not really dry at all. But it's very rich in tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and spice flavors that are balanced out by good enough acidity.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10029,Va Piano 2011 Les Collines Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Va Piano has introduced a stellar series of single-vineyard Syrahs. But if you had to pick just one, it would have to be this massive, beautifully structured bottle from Les Collines vineyard. Concentrated boysenberry fruit leads into a firm, sleek, subtle wine with even deeper flavors of black cherry, chocolate, espresso and baking spices.",65.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
10033,Epoch Estate Wines 2011 Veracity Paderewski Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"Remarkably inky in color for a Grenache-based blend, it features strong aromas of cedar, meat and deeply purple fruit. The soft, rich mouthfeel coats the palate like a luxurious lacquer, and features flavors of blackberry jam, macerated cherry and vanilla-spiced plums. The blend of florals, herbals, fruit and oak-driven tannins is masterful. Drink now by itself or with a peppercorn-crusted filet mignon.",65.0,95,1,0.999695852416706
10037,Va Piano 2012 Les Collines Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Almost jet black, this single-vineyard reserve sports marvelously complex aromas of smoked meat and dark fruits. Those perfectly ripened and layered berry, black cherry and cassis flavors are wrapped in slightly smoky, super-smooth tannins.",65.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
10046,Pacific Rim 2013 Selenium Vineyard Ice Wine Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Ice wines are a rarity in Washington. This one offers aromas of orange peel, flowers and candied ginger, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It's sweet (155g/L residual sugar) but is still quite deft in style.",55.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10048,Pomum 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine starts out quite reductive, while also showing aromas of black olive, herbs and chocolate. It's full bodied in feel with abundant dark fruit flavors that show persistence. There are good things here but the aromas and flavors seem disconnected.",35.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10051,Seven Hills 2013 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas are quite delicate for the variety and style, with fresh flowers, peach and whiffs of lychee. The palate is similarly restrained, showing elegance with the lightly sweet stone fruit flavors that are accented by bright acidity. It's all about nuance.",28.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10052,Seven Hills 2013 Old Vines Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of this jazzy wine disclose lime leaf, white peach and slate. The off-dry flavors of flowers, pear and stone fruit are typical of Washington in their intensity and detail.",17.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10056,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Piercing lime notes hit a staccato beat against ripe, luscious white grapefruit in this spry, zesty Riesling. A shade off dry, it's vibrant yet satisfyingly easy drinking. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance.",15.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10057,Three Rivers 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended with 9% Sémillon, this wine has aromas of lemon curd, starfruit, barrel spices (18% new French oak) and fig. It's full bodied, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish.",18.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10058,Three Rivers 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All the fruit for this wine comes from Bacchus Vineyard. Aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and apricot lead to medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors that linger.",15.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10060,For a Song 2013 Caliche Lake Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"Vibrant aromas of honeysuckle, honey-drizzled peach and green apple lead to medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. Pair it with a spicy Thai dish.",11.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10064,Gnarly Head 2014 Pinot Grigio (California),"Slightly herbal aromas and vivid citrus flavors lend a unique personality to this light-bodied wine. A whiff of just-chopped parsley precedes bright lemon-lime flavors and definite acidity that will help it pair smashingly with all kinds of seafood, salads and light pastas.",10.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10065,Kestrel 2011 Winemaker's Select Mourvèdre (Yakima Valley),"Fruit and barrel mix together on this lightly colored wine with aromas of coffee, herb, woodspice and pepper. The cherry flavors are reserved in style, pulling up toward the finish.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10066,Kestrel 2012 Winemaker's Select Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"Varietal aromas of fresh and dried herbs, flowers and cherries mix with tar, chocolate and barrel spices. The palate displays a reserved styling and a lingering finish.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10069,McFadden 2011 CORO Red (Mendocino),"Attractive and complex, this blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah starts with black pepper and roast beef aromas, then goes to deep, just-ripe flavors of Bing cherry and pomegranate. It has full body, good structure and texture. Moderate tannins and acidity balance out the richer impressions.",37.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10071,Pacific Rim 2014 Twin Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"A perfumed wine, this leaps up with aromas of white flowers, ginger and lychee. It drinks off dry, with a viscous, almost oily feel that provides a sense of heft.",16.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10072,Palmina 2010 Walker Barbera (Santa Ynez Valley),"Raspberry, white pepper, iron, dust and a Earl Grey tea element peek out from the delicate and restrained nose. Plums and red fruits mark the tip of the sip, but it clings to a gravelly, brick-laden center line of minerality, proving pleasantly peppery as well.",40.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10074,Ravines 2011 Pinot Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Understated on the nose, with hints of fresh strawberries and raspberries, this bone-dry rosé is quite penetrating on the palate, with a deep red-fruit flavor and a vein of crushed-stone minerality.",15.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10078,Alexandria Nicole 2009 Gravity Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"There are drying tannins and an earthy underpinning to this bottling of the Gravity Merlot. The cherry and cassis flavors have good grip, leading into a coffee-coated finish.",24.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10085,Covington 2011 Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain),"Using grapes sourced from Klipsun Vineyard, this is a roughly even Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon blend. Flavors of sweet toast, lemon verbena and melon, with a hint of mint and a splash of orange soda are all in evidence. Nicely nuanced, this does not overreach, but rather zooms in on the details of aroma and flavor that keep it interesting.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10088,Horse & Plow 2011 McFadden Farm Pinot Gris (Mendocino),"Steely and creamy at the same time, this is no shy Pinot Gris. It's got body and heft from its time spent in 100% French oak (none of it new), and tastes perfectly in balance, with delightful notes of honeysuckle, apricot and honey. This is a small production made from certified-organic grapes.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10096,Easton 2011 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Light in color, smooth, soft with a trace of astringency to the background, it shows off Barbera's marriage of acidity and denseness. It's a heavier version for sure, with spice and rustic black cherry.",25.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
10099,Helwig 2013 Rosé de Shenandoah Rosé (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Think of a pink version of Beaujolais Nouveau. The grapy flavors light up this light-bodied, extroverted rosé even more than the almost fluorescent pink color.

It's from the Santa Ynez Valley, although you'd never know that from the label, and shows that region's affinity for producing superior Syrah, when the farming is good. The wine is full-bodied and fairly high in alcohol, with rich, intricate blackberry, black currant, licorice, bacon, baker's chocolate and black pepper flavors.

10338,Kenwood 2006 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle.

10373,Miracle Valley 2010 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"This wine smells like an ice cream sundae, with scents of mint-chocolate chip and cookie dough, plus touches of strawberry and cherry sauce. Light to medium bodied, it has a malleable midpalate, but the tannins gain astringency on the finish. As the wine sits in the glass, the fruit seems to fall away, and the palate becomes more brittle feeling.",26.0,83,1,0.999695852416706

10406,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Merlot (Applegate Valley),"Merlot needs more concentration than this in order to really shine as a stand-alone varietal wine. This is thin, green, and simply generic. Pomegranate fruit peeks through, quickly overlaid with weedy tannins.",25.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
10408,San Simeon 2012 Estate Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"The aromas are extremely tight on this bottling, even after hour so being opened, with just the hint of black plum emergent.

10430,Saini 2011 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This big, lusty Zin has high alcohol, which gives it a full bodied, glyceriney sweetness, as well as some heat. It's ripe in blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Great to drink now with barbecue.",24.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

10434,Six Sigma Ranch 2012 Marianne's Rosé (Lake County),"Marianne's is made from Syrah grapes grown in the vineyard of the same name, the grapes pressed and resulting juice fermented on its own, making for a relatively meaty style of rosé, dry, with aromas of tart raspberry and an almost apricot fuzz, Sauvignon Blanc quality. Pair with stinky cheeses.",16.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
10439,Blue Plate 2012 Dry Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),"A pretty, floral wine, bright with melon and honey, straightforwardly lean and ready to drink at your next picnic, hike or ski trip, a great value for a solidly well-made wine with texture to pair with charcuterie, falafel or spiced chickpeas.",11.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
10465,Rippey 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Shy on the nose, this wine has dry, sticky tannins that cling to a wall of high-toned red fruit, mostly plum, forming a medium weight on the palate. Softening out as it goes, it leaves black pepper on the finish.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
10469,Vasco Urbano 2012 H.P. Raboli Vineyard Mourvèdre (Livermore Valley),"This combines the sweet spiciness of oak with the apparent sweetness of the grapes in a full-bodied, extreme-flavored package.

10472,Lumos 2013 Temperance Hill Vineyard Julia Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Already showing good focus and pinpoint acidity, th is wine brings green berries, kiwi and lime fruit flavors to the front.

10481,Stellina 2011 Selvaggio Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Juicy in blueberry and explosive blackberry fruit, this offers the right succulent mix of dusty spice and well-mannered fruitiness. For pairings, aim for the usual barbecue but perhaps also a risotto or finely made pizza.",32.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
10485,Borra 2012 Intuition Field Blend White (Lodi),"Another of Borra's inventive blends, this one brings together 60% Kerner, 20% Riesling and 20% Gewürztraminer.

10490,Wente 2011 Small Lot Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),"Richly perfumed with layers of plum and clove, this is a soft, fully developed Cab Franc.

10494,Rex Hill 2009 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A beautifully rendered, light and detailed Oregon Pinot Gris, this is redolent of spring flowers and citrus peel, flavored with an elegant blend of pineapple, Asian pear, jicama and white pepper. Very fresh and spicy.",16.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10499,Kendric 2007 Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"A rich, dry wine, soft and velvety in tannins. It feels satisfying all the way through. Not super-big in fruit, but nuanced, offering layers of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, leather and pepper. One of the finer Syrahs to come out of the Sierra Foothills this year. Ready now.",21.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10500,LaVelle 2008 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A light, almost delicate wine, with pretty pear fruit and a hint of sweetness. The balance is just right, and the wine shows some added flair as it wraps into a finish that seems to gather strength while adding floral and lightly honeyed highlights.",18.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10505,Kramer 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Not sure which vineyard sourced the grapes, but this is a flavorful, ready-to-drink bottle of wine. There is substantial evidence of aging in expensive new oak barrels, with a lot of coconut flavor over toast, chocolate and cherry. Tannins are soft and the fruit is round and luscious; except for a slight fall-off in the finish this could be from any one of a number of well-known Walla Walla wineries.",28.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10511,Nickel & Nickel 2007 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",50.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
10514,Robert Pepi 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Fills an important niche in California whites, a bone-dry, tartly crisp, minerally wine that gets the mouth watering.

10522,Donati 2010 Merlot (Paicines),"Give this Merlot some time to breathe before serving. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, gritty and tannic. It will never be a mellow wine, but it does have nice black-cherry and licorice flavors.",25.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10523,Fess Parker 2010 The Big Easy Red (Santa Barbara County),"Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache, this robust, tannic blend has sweet-tasting jam and cola flavors, plus a note of peppery spice.

10530,Mazzocco 2010 Seaton Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Made in the Mazzocco style of high alcohol and superripeness, this Zinfandel, which contains a splash of Petite Sirah, tastes like Port.

10542,Peloton 2011 Jesperson Ranch Albariño (Edna Valley),"Albariño is very sensitive to the slightest usage of oak. Although this wine has only a touch of neutral oak, the wood still sticks out. The barrel influence gives it a buttered toast and caramel heaviness. Try this as an alternative to Chardonnay.",27.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10546,Bota Box 2011 Merlot (California),"This fresh, spicy Merlot is easy to drink, and it deals jammy berry, cola and fruit punch flavors. It's a great wine to serve at parties.",21.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

10554,Lucas Vineyards 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A perfumed whiff of citrus blossoms introduces this crisp, light-footed Riesling. Subtly semidry in style, the palate contrasts ripe, rich honey and nectarine flavors against a backdrop of sharp, lemon-lime acidity. Touches of savory nut and earth tones lend contrast to the moderately long finish.",14.0,87,1,0.999695852416706

10559,Holly's Hill 2012 Petit Patriarche Red (El Dorado),"This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
10561,Cave B 2014 Cuvée Blanc White (Ancient Lakes),This wine is equal parts Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas and off-dry flavors of grass and fig seem a bit muddled but still bring enjoyment.,25.0,86,1,0.999695852416706

10583,Wind Rose 2012 Stone Tree Vineyard Primitivo (Wahluke Slope),"Aromatically appealing, this suggests black raspberries, tart cherries and herbs, with light citrus and barrel accents. It's tart and quite restrained for the variety with plumy fruit flavors and a slightly chalky feel to the tannins that may resolve with some additional time in the bottle.",25.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10585,Wölffer 2012 Merlot (Long Island),"Darker notes of espresso and dried herbs contrast with fragrant blossom and cherry aromas on this plump, full-bodied wine. Supple like silk, it's rich and ripe with cherry and plum flavors blanketed soft, chalky tannin.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
10593,Ded.Reckoning 2012 No. 10 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This bottle is quite unusual for a Washington Malbec with abundant notes of freshly squeezed Meyer lemon, plum and herbs.

10600,Avelina 2011 Sands Point Merlot (Sonoma County),"For the price, this Merlot packs a delicious punch, offering soft, persistent layers of chocolate, tar and leather, the tannins present yet well-managed.

10617,Coquelicot 2008 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little clumsy in the mouth, with some green flavors alongside the apricot, citrus and slate flavors.

10620,The Crusher 2009 Grower's Selection Petite Sirah (Clarksburg),"So young, it tastes like it's still fermenting. Not a bad wine, but freshly tart and strong in grapy flavors. Should calm down by mid-2011 and become a nice, full-bodied and dry red wine.",15.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
10621,Brander 2015 Bouchet Red,"Black cherry pie, milk chocolate and lilacs combine for a very accessible and rather lavish nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot.

10622,Brander 2015 Tierra Alta Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Ballard Canyon),"Grass, wet concrete, bitter orange rinds, wet hay and rosemary elements show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. There is a firm, cement-like texture to the sip, much like licking rocks, with fresh lime peel flavors. It retains freshness days after opening.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
10627,Z'IVO 2012 Pinot Blanc (Eola-Amity Hills),"This late release offers a good look at how the better Oregon white wines can improve with a few additional years in the bottle.

10648,Di Arie 2011 Estate Grown & Bottled Tempranillo (El Dorado),"Wonderful cedar and tobacco aromas, sophisticated cinnamon and dark-fruit flavors, lavish tannins and full body create a gorgeous taste experience. This wine is plush and generous in texture, and exotic and delicious in flavor. It should age well through at least 2020.",30.0,92,1,0.999695852416706
10657,Two Vintners 2013 Stonetree Vineyard Zinfandel (Wahluke Slope),"A consistent standout for this winery, the new vintage does not disappoint.

10658,Westwood 2014 Legend Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Grown Red (Sonoma Valley),"This is an unusually perfumed commingling of varieties not always seen together, including 45% Tannat, 44% Syrah and 11% Counoise.

10666,J. Lohr 2013 Tower Road Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"The power of smoky oak shows strongly on this wine.

10674,Gary Farrell 2013 Grist Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender.

10687,Maryhill 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Tavola Rosso Sangiovese Cabernet (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, the Tavola Rosso is a wine that seems to be in search of a distinct identity. Tannic, drying and vanilla soaked, it has a red fruit flavor that vanishes all too quickly.",32.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

10721,Oso Libre 2011 Osezno Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Offering a more traditional California Zinfandel style than some of the other 2011s, this takes off with scents of a warm, butter-crusted cherry pie, unfolding on the palate with cranberry jelly. There's a slight herbal character and quite of bit of tannic grip, so expect this one to improve in the years to come.",38.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
10722,Brutocao 2010 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"Comprised of 66% Zinfandel, 20% Barbera and 14% Primitivo. Brutocao has gone in a different direction than most of its 2010 Coro counterparts. It mixes in Barbera, presumably for acidity and freshness, to the bigger boned personalities of Zin and Primitivo. In the end, the fruit and acidity are dulled by the toffee and oak and grippy, grizzled leather in this wine.",40.0,85,1,0.999695852416706

10740,O'Brien 2006 Unrestrained Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"Lush and delicious, if a little soft, with palate-flattering flavors of black currants, milk chocolate and cedar, and sweet herbs like dill and sage.

11012,Schramsberg 2007 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (North Coast),"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse. It seems to boil in the glass, and the followup mouthfeel is as creamy and refined as any California sparkler in memory. The Pinot asserts itself in delicate touches of raspberries and strawberries. Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",38.0,94,1,0.999695852416706

The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak.

11046,Tre Anelli 2012 Rosé Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Deep ruby pink in color, this wine begins with a nuanced nose, mixing the fun of grape soda with the elegance of purple flowers.

11356,Firestone 2012 Gewurztraminer (Santa Ynez Valley),"Shimmeringly crystalline in the glass, this wine looks electric. A beautiful bouquet of tuberose and honey warns that the sipping experience may border on cloying.

11456,Coral Wines 2014 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An inaugural release, this blend of Mourvèdre (85%) and Cinsault is pale copper with salmon tinges. Aromas of strawberry and rose petal lead to dry, full-feeling fruit flavors that linger.",20.0,88,1,0.999695852416706

11498,Crinella 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California.

Aged in 30% new oak, it's showing generous streaks of graphite, smoke and char, with accents of cured meat around the blackest of black fruits. Well-named and well-constructed.",62.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
11554,Pahlmeyer 2013 Red (Napa Valley),"A powerfully rich and concentrated Bordeaux-style blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of four other Bordeaux varieties, this wine presents itself as juicy and fresh on entry, with high-toned sparks of cranberry, cherry and cassis. It takes on more strength and structure as it opens, suggesting its worth for the cellar. Hold until 2023–2028.",175.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11560,Stolpman 2014 Angeli Syrah (Ballard Canyon),"As the Stolpman family's top-of-the-line bottling each vintage, this wine impresses on all fronts. Candied boysenberry, dried lilac, snapped dark chocolate and hints of dried mint show on the nose. The entry into the palate is refined and soft with juicy mulberry and elderberry fruit plus touches of thyme and forest floor. Firm but polished tannins and a decent dose of acidity ensure long drinkability. Drink now–2029.",68.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11569,Iron Horse 2011 Brut X Sparkling (Green Valley),"X is for extra dry, and this is, made from 74% Pinot Noir, the remainder Chardonnay. It jumps out of the glass in an explosion of nutty, salty lemon peel, dry as a bone and rewarding in its full embrace of minerality. This sparkler begs for oysters and a skiff out to sea.",50.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11572,Pahlmeyer 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"The wine launched cinematically by Robert Redford in “Indecent Proposal,” this delivers a succulently memorable and seductive mix of crisp cassis and meaty rare beef, a sanguine underpinning that gives it intrigue. Full bodied and ripely crafted, it is completely satisfying in its classical components of sage and cedar, with a lingering lust of chocolate-covered cherry.",85.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11574,Golden Triangle 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"It's a good thing Garagiste Festival cofounder Stewart McLennan caught the winemaking bug. This delicious bottling shows black currant, plum, blueberry, fennel, lavender, vanilla and gingerbread spice on the nose. Elegant purple-flower elements kick off the palate, and then come waves of blueberry-chiffon cake, blackberry juice, sea-salt caramel and a touch of vanilla.",55.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11575,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2014 WCS Jack John Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Plush black-currant aromas meet with light licorice and a plum-pudding note on the nose of this 70% Grenache, 28% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier blend. It dries up tightly on the palate, showing blackberry alongside strong licorice and violet elements, all framed by a chalky structure.",75.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11577,Robert Biale 2014 Stagecoach Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"From the only producer to source Zin from this famous vineyard, this wine is abundant in a complexity of baked bread, blackberry jam and vanilla, with endless depth on the palate. Fresh and juicy, it balances its fruitiness with mountain-sized tannin strength and concentration.",52.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11583,Alta Colina 2013 Toasted Slope Estate Syrah (Adelaida District),"Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins.",48.0,94,1,0.999695852416706
11584,Ded.Reckoning 2012 Flintlock Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This wine is aromatically untoward with notes of seabreeze, green herbs, citrus and wood. It's medium bodied, somewhat gritty in feel, with barnyard flavors.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

11593,Palaia Vineyards 2007 Merlot (New York),"Hints of toast, mushroom and black coffee lend a savory, earthy tone to ruddy black cherry and plum flavors. A bit clumsy and fading on the palate, it's showing its age, so best to drink up soon.",17.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11594,Pomelo 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"It's rather understated in flavor, and more smooth and round than typical for the variety. This is a good, rich-textured, medium-bodied wine with straightforward flavors.",10.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11599,Kunde 2011 Destination Series Barbera (Sonoma Valley),"There's a funky herbal, slightly green quality to this wine, possessed of plenty acidity, as the variety is known for, yet muted in its typical floral aromatics and bright fruit.",30.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11604,Winery by the Creek 2012 Reserve Vine Hill Vineyard Sangiovese (El Dorado),"This has a firm texture and ripe to overripe fruit flavors. With full body, flavors of tomato and balsamic, it should be best with hearty and rich dishes.",16.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11605,Wild Meadows 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An enjoyable easy drinker with notes of bell pepper and sugared plum. It's broad in feel, lightly sweet with abundant plum flavors.",12.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11611,Vortex 2010 CM2 Red (Rattlesnake Hills),This blend of Cinsault (75%) and Mourvèdre already seems quite advanced. Notes of raisined fruit and brown spices come along with light cranberry flavors that seem to have faded.,23.0,83,1,0.999695852416706
11613,Macari 2004 Bergen Road Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This medium-bodied Bordeaux blend features deep spice, pepper and red cherry flavors. It's a soft wine with gentle tannins and a subtle overall character.",43.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11614,Vie Winery 2005 Beatty Ranch Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"The fault with this enormous Zin is that despite a hefty 15.6% alcohol, it still tastes as sweet as a ruby Port. Fifty percent new oak only contributes caramel to what should properly be labeled a dessert wine.",39.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11617,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Calvin Clarion Red (New Mexico),"A pretty floral nose and appetizing, juicy flavors of jammy fruit should recommend this wine, but there's a bitterness on the midplate and finish that make the wine a touch too angular. Pair with food to even it out.",28.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11618,Paradise Ridge 2003 Rockpile Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),Smells and tastes vegetal; this is not a successful wine.,32.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11619,Unionville 2004 Hunter's Red Reserve Meritage Red (New Jersey),"This Bordeaux blend from New Jersey has appropriate aromas and flavors of dark berry, cedar, tobacco and spice, but it lacks the dimension and muscularity that makes this type of blend memorable. Still, it's a pretty wine and will pair well with numerous meat and fowl dishes.",25.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11622,Claar 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a bit stinky right out of the bottle, with some sour, rotten egg aromas. Ultimately they blow off, but there's still a palate impression of sulfur and burnt match. The net effect is to put a damper on the fruit, which pokes through the sulfurous fog tasting rather soapy and limpid.",12.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11623,Dos Cabezas 2005 El Norte Red (Cochise County),"This Mourvèdre/Grenache/Petite Sirah blend offers appealing aromas and flavors of spicy berry and smoke, with good structure and length. The smoky character borders on excessive, though, so pair it with some grilled, spicy ribs or kebabs for the best experience.",20.0,82,1,0.999695852416706

11625,Epiphany 2004 Gypsy Red (Santa Barbara County),"Epiphany's varietal '04s weren't very good, so how could this Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah blend be? It's dry, tannic and dull, with thin, barely ripe flavors.",25.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11627,Yellow Hawk Cellar 2003 Mescolanza di Rosso Riserva Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine doesn't have much going on. It's dried out, chalky in the mouth, stemmy and bitter with green tannins. The fruit is dried out and there is a scent of brett as well.",28.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11628,Buena Vista 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"There are some problems here, beginning with a vegetal, asparagus smell and ending with a soft, simple syrup finish. In between are some decent cherry flavors wrapped into harsh tannins.",21.0,82,1,0.999695852416706
11631,Tahoe Ridge 2004 Merlot (Lodi),"With its sugary, baked blackberry fruit, this Merlot is simply too soft and sweet, especially at this price.",28.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
11632,Two Wives 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a thin line between attractive gooseberry and hay aromas, and more severe pungency. This wine is strong in the latter.",16.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
11634,Robert Hall 2004 Hall Ranch Meritage (Paso Robles),"Hall struggles with Bordeaux-style wines, and no more so than in this hot vintage. Although the wine is fully dry, it's harsh, with very little fruit, and a hot, tannic finish.",35.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
11635,Naches Heights 2006 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A flat tasting, slightly sweet, generic white wine.",16.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
11637,Jana 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"The brambly wild berry flavors have an exotic edge of white pepper and Chinese five-spice that's interesting and even complex. But the wine is utterly lacking in acidity, which makes it syrupy even though it's totally dry.",35.0,81,1,0.999695852416706
11671,Municipal Winemakers 2016 Blanche Old Vine Chenin Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Pale in the glass, this wine from the Jurassic Park Vineyard booms with clean and crisp tropical notes on the nose, showing poached pear, papaya, pineapple and gardenia aromas. Energetic acidity delivers its peach, mango and guava flavors, making for a potent but not treacly palate.",26.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
11673,Noble Vines 2016 242 Sauvignon Blanc (San Bernabe),"This vintage shows cut grass, ripe apple, pear, wet cement and nectarine sorbet aromas in a wine that's almost as clear as water. The palate is textural and full of zip, with rainy day-like crispness and green fruit flavors.",11.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
11677,Bearboat 2008 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"An easy, gentle red wine, full-bodied and spicy, with extravagantly ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. Pretty good, but lacks those extra layers of complexity, so drink now.",17.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
11684,Cedar Mountain 2000 Late Bottled Vintage Port Port (California),"This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too.",40.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
11691,Pezzi King 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Sugary sweet and soft, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha, vanilla, cinnamon, clove and pepper flavors. It's a country-style Zin made for washing down barbecue.",18.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
11693,Trentadue 2009 Block 500 Estate Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Heavy and oaky, with a full-bodied, soft mouthfeel. But it's rich and sweet in cherries, blackberries, plums, mocha and spices. Pretty good price for a nice, everyday Merlot.",15.0,85,1,0.999695852416706
11699,Davenport Cellars 2009 Snowflake White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest Sémillon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value.",16.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11700,Fidelitas 2007 Red Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish.",45.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11703,Nefarious 2009 Defiance Vineyard Viognier (Lake Chelan),"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.",19.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11708,Brecon Estate 2015 Albariño (Central Coast),"Intensely plush aromas of peach, daffodil, sweet rose and even pineapple show on the nose of this botting. There's lots of sizzle to the racy sip, where tart green apple, green pear and green-tomato flavors make for a tangy, refreshing wine.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11711,Cupcake 2014 Black Forest Decadent Red (California),"This full-bodied wine smells like black currants and blackberries, tastes ripe, and is lightly tannic to give it a little grip. Bring on the beef or pork tenderloin.",15.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11717,Fox Run 2012 Riesling 12 Hanging Delta Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The 12 Hanging Delta Vineyard is a plusher, more decadent expression of grapefruit, mandarin orange and stone fruit flavors common to all of Fox Run's 2012 geology series. It's lip-smacking with sweetness and exceptionally light in body yet maintains an elegant, vibrant style. The finish is tinged by an earthier touch of smoked nuts and slate.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11719,Graziano 2013 Grenache (Mendocino County),"Very ripe flavors make this wine seem almost sweet and the rich texture coats the mouth, augmenting the syrupy impression. Flavors suggest plump raspberries and fresh blackberries, while the finish brings out milk chocolate.",19.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11722,Tortoise Creek 2013 The Chelonian Zinfandel (Lodi),"Attractive sage and fresh-cut wood accents stay with this full-bodied, value-priced wine from the aroma to the finish. Generous, jammy fruit flavors fill in the middle. Extra time soaking with the grape skins helped make it delicious and spicy, mouthfilling and smooth.",12.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11727,Boeger 2014 Migliore Red (El Dorado),"Rich, melt-in-the-mouth fruit flavors and a smooth, supple texture make this wine hard to resist. Black cherry and blueberry in the aromas and flavors get a little grip from light tannins on the palate.",30.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11728,Boeger 2015 Zinfandel (El Dorado),"This powerful wine nicely balances big fruit flavors with a firm texture and full body. There are raspberries in the aroma, sweet and sour cherries in the flavor, and a nice, gripping mouthfeel.",12.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11729,Bogle 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),Lively fruit flavors and great balance make this wine easy to appreciate and a versatile pairing with food. Fresh cherry and raspberry aromas meet rich flavors on a smooth texture that has just enough light tannins for a little grip.,12.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11730,Brian Benson 2013 Neapolitan Pussycat Red (Paso Robles),"This bottling of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre presents a dusty, slightly sweet-smelling nose, with blackberry syrup and leather aromas. Juicy blueberries and blackberries lead into a sip laced with licorice, tobacco and lava rock, finishing on a note of burnt caramel. It's quite dense so needs lots of time to open up.",55.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11732,Fenestra 2011 Tempranillo (Livermore Valley),"This robust red shows plenty of ripe berry flavors, firm texture and full body. It has a gripping mouthfeel and persistent raspberry and cranberry flavors that make the mouth water.",25.0,89,1,0.999695852416706

11734,Glenora 2015 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Equal parts fresh fruit and earthy complexity, this elegant off-dry wine offers loads of plush yellow peach, mango and yellow cherry flavors off set by undertones of crushed stone and soil. It's delectably juicy and vibrantly fresh through a moderately long finish.",14.0,89,1,0.999695852416706
11735,Airfield Estates 2013 Mustang Red (Yakima Valley),"Syrah makes up three-quarters of this wine with Grenache (20%) and Syrah accounting for the rest.

11736,Ambassador Vineyard 2013 Estate Grown Syrah (Red Mountain),"Cigar box, café au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment.",30.0,88,1,0.999695852416706
11737,Parkers Estate 2010 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County),"A little sharp and green, but give it a fatty steak or ribs and it will do just fine. Just needs some protein to wake up the blackberry and cherry sweetness.",20.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11738,Troon 2009 Kubli Bench Zinfandel (Applegate Valley),"Although the blend includes 20% Primitivo and 5% Petite Sirah, which might be expected to add some tannic muscle to the wine, this is a simple red quaffer, with light raspberry fruit and a hint of milk chocolate.",24.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
11740,10 Knots 2010 Viognier (Paso Robles),"A strongly flavored, sugary, unsubtle wine, leaving little to the imagination. Swamps the mouth with ripe, jammy flavors of pineapples, apricots, mangoes, limes, kiwi fruit and honey.",22.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

11764,Tre Nova 2010 Nebbaro Red Barbera-Nebbiolo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 51% Nebbiolo and 49% Barbera. It's aromatically intriguing, with a whiff of Asian spices and a dusting of cocoa powder. Though almost four years old, it hasn't entirely jelled—it drinks like two different wines, one tart and acidic, with light red berry flavors; the other smooth and almost silky.",30.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
11765,Two Ponds 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An appealing wine with notes of herbs, gooseberry and guava. It's medium-bodied with some residual sugar (1.2 g/L) helping it go down easy.",10.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
11768,Virage 2010 Red (Napa Valley),"From a challenging Napa Valley vintage, this red is made in what the winemaker calls a “Right Bank” style, blending 56% Cabernet Franc with 42% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon from vineyards such as Hyde in Carneros. The wine is brimming in dark plum and severe chocolate and cherry, with a reasonable amount of grip.",54.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
11771,Keuka Spring 2013 Humphreys Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Notes of pollen and nuts lend an earthy warmth to aromas of lemon zest and honey tangerine on this brisk, vivacious Riesling.

11774,Mercer 2013 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),"Lightly spicy and quite refreshing, this is a gentle wine, with a mix of melon and white peach fruit. Simple but perfect for every day.",13.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
11776,Obelisco Estate 2011 Les Gosses Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"A sniff of leather and limited fruit freshness detract this wine from reaching the level of the previous vintage. It's got some berry flavors and a bit of barrel toast and chocolate, but falls away quickly. Two bottles tasted.",40.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
11784,Still Waters 2010 Malbec (Paso Robles),"Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside. It's a little rustic around the edges once sipped, but pleasantly so. The mouthfeel is soft, the flavors are peppery and the tannins and acidity are built to last.",28.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
11794,San Antonio 2010 Cask 520 Red (Paso Robles),"Named after the redwood tank where the first Riboli family vintners stored their best wine a century ago, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 16% Petit Verdot and 14% Malbec shows blueberry and slate minerality on the nose, alongside licorice and mint spices. The palate is overwhelmed by tannins, though black pepper, tobacco and charred meat flavors emerge.",30.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
11801,Comartin 2012 The Porterhouse Syrah-Grenache (Central Coast),"This blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache offers heady and thick violet and plum extract aromas, and smells heavier in alcohol than it is. The palate shows ripe black cherry, but it's eye-wateringly tannic, and needs quite a bit of time in the cellar to evolve.",40.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
11806,Kunde 2012 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Substantial in dense red plum and black cherry, this dry, chewy wine will benefit from a decant or time in the glass. It furnishes a high-toned kick of acidity on the finish.",22.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
11807,Bodega de Edgar 2010 B de E Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"Lots of jammy red cherry, anise and cola flavors in this simple but likeable Tempranillo. It has the weight of a Pinot Noir. The silky, smoky sweetness suggests drinking with a juicy hamburger.",34.0,84,1,0.999695852416706

12121,Paradise Ridge 1999 Ladi's Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness.",23.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12136,McManis 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi),"Spicy, smoky oak aromas dominate this dark-colored and full-bodied wine. Cherry and raspberry emerge as the flavors. The texture is plush but not quite soft, as firm tannins and moderate acidity give it good structure.",11.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12137,Midnight 2014 Aurora White (Paso Robles),"This blend of 30% Viognier, 30% Grenache Blanc, 17% Picpoul Blanc, 17% Roussanne and 6% Marsanne offers hints of honeycomb and yellow apple on the nose. Green apple, bruised pear and salted nectarine flavors show on the palate.",29.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12139,North by Northwest 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Light volatile aromas distract from this blend of Seven Hills (75%) and Les Collines vineyards. The fruit flavors seem a bit leaner than expected and also somewhat dried out.,35.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12140,Prager 2010 Royal Escort Paladini Vineyard Port (Napa Valley),"This strong dessert wine is made from 100% Petite Sirah grapes from a particular site and was bottled in 2013. Salty, mushroom and earth aromas drift upward from the glass followed by a thickness of sour-sweet dark chocolate and raisins.",72.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12142,Rutherford Ranch 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Brambly blackberry and leathery tar make for a full-bodied atmosphere around what is actually a fairly light, integrated and smooth wine. Clove and black currant give the finish a spicy edge.",24.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12146,Steiner Family Vineyards 2012 Free Bird Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Smooth and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine combines light cinnamon and cherry aromas with rich plum flavors. It has a good harmony between bright acidity and ripe fruitiness.",20.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12148,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2014 Estate Grown and Bottled Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Savory whiffs of dried herbs, pine needles and dusty minerals open to a bright, delicately fruity palate of crisp tangerine and quince. Dry and spry, it offers brisk, cooling refreshment. Drink now–2017.",40.0,87,1,0.999695852416706
12157,Bianchi 2012 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"You'll find lots of ripe orange, pineapple, lemon and honeysuckle flavors in this crisp, acidic Pinot Grigio. It finishes with a hint of maple syrup.",15.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12160,un4seen 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"Notes of sour apple and lemon accompany this wine's dialed-high acidity. Priced to sell, it'll suffice in certain settings as an apéritif or quaffer with snacks.",10.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12165,The White Knight 2012 Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"This is a light, steely white with more honeysuckle and floral characteristics than fruit. It's light in alcohol and texture, and especially good for the wine drinker looking for something subtle.",13.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12166,Tildio 2010 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Hailing from Weinbau Vineyard, it brings notes of chocolate, cherry cordial and herbs. It's quite tart—almost sour—with a dry, chalky feel.",30.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12167,Two Mountain 2009 Copeland Vineyard Brothers No. 4 Red (Yakima Valley),"This appears to be a wine that's simply over-reached. Noticeably high-toned, with a vinegary bite to the cherry flavored fruit, it's pushed it a bit too far. Not even 28 months in three quarters new French oak can mask the volatility.",50.0,84,1,0.999695852416706
12186,Midnight 2013 Capriccio Italian Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"The convergence of high alcohol, acidity and tannin will make this Super Tuscan-style blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot last quite a while. Intense plum brandy aromas meet nose-tickling licorice notes on the nose while the palate's grippy tannins present vanilla, cherry, blackberry and candied lilac flavors. Drink 2018–2028.",48.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12188,Municipal Winemakers 2014 Dark Red Wine Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"This 50–50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows elegant layers of black currant, blackberry, purple flower, milk chocolate, anise and vanilla aromas. The palate is rich, thick and deep, with brooding yet well-integrated black fruit and hearty spice notes.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12190,Six Sigma Ranch 2016 Michael's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"With a touch more depth and complexity than Six Sigma's other offering, this wine has ripe melon and fig flavors, full body and a creamy texture that make it a standout. It's a far cry from the tangy, herbaceous sstyle of Sauvignon Blanc, bringing plenty of depth and a mouthfilling texture to the table.",36.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12191,Sol Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Red Hills Lake County),"This excellent, medium-bodied wine matured in neutral oak barrels is the third of three straight outstanding vintages. It leads with earthy, smoky complexity rather than simple fruit. It smells meaty and peppery and carries those savory notes into its spicy black plum flavors.",32.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12195,Limerick Lane 2015 Hail Mary Syrah-Grenache (Russian River Valley),"Robust tannins support bold swathes of leather, garrigue and dried herb notes in this complex, savory wine. Dark and brooding, it has a snap of fresh cherry, raspberry and orange fruit that lifts its denser aspects of brambly berry, meat and tobacco.",52.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12199,Argyle 2015 Nuthouse Master Series Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"Round rather than racy, this fruity effort rings out with peach, melon and papaya flavors. It's finished dry with just 4g/L residual sugar, and the delicious finish has a honeysuckle note.",30.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12200,Berryhill 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),"This is an unusually complex and intricate wine that has more than simple crispness. It starts with grapefruit and bitter apple aromas and builds toward vibrant but rich grapefruit, mineral and savory consommé flavors. The texture is broad and mouthfilling but well supported and balanced by acidity. A great debut for Berryhill.",15.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12202,Austin Hope 2004 Hope Family Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"The very hot vintage took its toll on this 100% varietal Syrah. While it's nicely dry, with a finely tannic structure, it tastes a bit soft and hot. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a dessicated, raisiny edge. Drink now.",42.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
12205,Hall 2004 Napa River Ranch Merlot (Napa Valley),"This '04 is off a beat from the '03, showing a tiredness that may be a result of the heat. It's soft, with candied blackberry and cherry flavors that finish dry, and is not ageworthy.",50.0,86,1,0.999695852416706
12217,Jaxon 2011 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this lightly colored wine brings appealing notes of assorted berries, herbs and barrel spices. It's very pretty in style, soft in feel with a lingering finish.",28.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12221,Elk Cove 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This full-bodied, lightly spiced wine seduces with fresh fruit flavors of pear, apple, kiwi and melon. Polished and bracing, it finishes with a lick of wet stone.",19.0,91,1,0.999695852416706
12228,V. Sattui 2012 Dry Gewurztraminer (Anderson Valley),"This is a very good dry Gewürztraminer that's laden in jasmine and honey, extremely perfumed on the nose, and light and crisp on the palate. With a suggestion of vanilla on the finish, it's a balanced white, ready to be enjoyed with a salad dressed with figs and goat cheese.",24.0,90,1,0.999695852416706
