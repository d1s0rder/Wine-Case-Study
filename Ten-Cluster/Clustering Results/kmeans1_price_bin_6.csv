4520,Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard La Masía Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar.",35.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,20-40
973,Bergström 2015 Old Stones Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.",35.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,20-40
2036,Dutton Estate 2010 Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging.",40.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,20-40
2282,Marimar Estate 2011 Don Miguel Vineyard Bonita's Hill Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone.",43.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
4068,Patz & Hall 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced. Citrus, wet stone and sea salt lift the minerality to pronounced levels, accented by a crispness of lemon peel and papaya wrapped in blossoming jasmine. Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty.",44.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
4073,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Origin Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish.",48.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
970,Shafer 2015 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.",52.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
5647,Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",55.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
5631,Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",55.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
4171,Domaine Drouhin 2015 Édition Limitée Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit. A lush mix of tangerine, melon and peach notes combine, expanding across the palate. It's drinking quite well already but should continue improve through 2024.",65.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
315,Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",68.0,96,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
312,Rochioli 2014 South River Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last.",68.0,96,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
9628,Paul Hobbs 2008 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.",70.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
5643,Lynmar 2011 La Serenité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",70.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
8914,Lynmar 2015 La Sereinite Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension.",70.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
2274,Paul Hobbs 2012 Ellen Lane Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Sunflower-gold in color, this heady, hedonistic Chardonnay brims with aromas of toasted brioche, lemon and herb. Bright and completely balanced, it invites sip after sip until there simply is no more. Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue.",75.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
1440,Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",75.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
974,Big Table Farm 2015 Elusive Queen Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.",85.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
4179,Bergström 2015 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This succulent wine is saturated with rich citrus flavors. Grapefruit, lemon, lime and pineapple notes combine while its 18 months in barrel contributes a layer of buttery toast.",95.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
4180,Bethel Heights 2014 The High Wire Estate Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"The debut vintage for this cuvée, this is made from 100% Wente clone vines planted in 1977. It's richly concented on the palate, layered with dried apricot, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. A lush, buttery note enwraps its long, satisfying, full-bodied finish.",95.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279,above 40
