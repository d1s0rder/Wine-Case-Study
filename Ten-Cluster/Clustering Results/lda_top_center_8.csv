50011,ONX 2011 Reckoning Red (Paso Robles),"There's a crazy mix of grape varieties in this blend—Syrah, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo and Grenache—but each grape brings its own unique voice to form a very complex chorus. While any of them, on its own, might be incomplete, the resulting whole is rich, full-bodied, warming and satisfying.
