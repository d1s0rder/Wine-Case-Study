90981,Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",20.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,10-20
37389,Macauley 2007 Special Selected Late Harvest Botrytis Sémillon (Alexander Valley),"This is one of the best dessert wines available from California. It's dazzlingly rich and sweet in orange jam, apricot, honey, buttered cinnamon toast and créme brûlée flavors. The intense sweetness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, and the wine despite its sweetness accomplishes the miracle of finishing dry and clean. The grapes are 100% Sémillon.",45.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
81466,Roederer Estate 2007 Brut L'Ermitage Estate Bottled Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity. A layered texture seems to blend in accents of almond and vanilla, increasing complexity with each sip. It's one of California's blue-chip bubblies.",48.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
73352,Buty 2007 Columbia Rediviva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"From the winery's Phinny Hill vineyard, the Columbia Rediviva is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 52% Syrah. Complex and satiny, it's a riveting wine, inky and bursting with a sensuous mix of berry, cassis, mocha, loam, cinnamon and spice. Tremendous density and depth; despite its youth the wine curls around the tongue like thick smoke, showing more and more detail.",48.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
98009,Bien Nacido 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"From the vineyard's choicest blocks. There's so much going on here, it's hard to know where to begin. Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins. Extraordinarily good now, and should develop in interesting ways. Certainly one of the best California Syrahs of the last few vintages.",52.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
90986,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",53.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
90980,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",53.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
67963,Corliss Estates 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This winery gives its wines extra years in bottle prior to release, and it pays off with powerful, muscular, densely structured that have been polished to a fine luster. This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa. It shows tremendous depth, and it could be cellared for another few years—but why wait?",55.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
90989,Buty 2007 Rediviva of the Stones Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",55.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
40903,Ravenswood 2007 Old Hill Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",60.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
90978,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",64.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
100893,Martin Ray 2007 Synthesis Red (Napa Valley),"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years.",75.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
42385,Dolce 2007 Late Harvest Wine Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% Sémillon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc.",85.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
28608,Blackbird Vineyards 2007 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least.",90.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
48581,Shoup 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.",95.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
83934,Duckhorn 2007 The Discussion Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),"Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s.",115.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
13592,Schramsberg 2007 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"This gorgeous, full-bodied and compelling wine is made from 84% Chardonnay and 16% Pinot Noir. It has a rich golden color, slightly earthy aromas, plus bread dough and white-peach scents that lead to very opulent, sophisticated and nicely aged flavors that range from toasted walnut to honeyed peach to white pepper. While it's already nine years old, this will easily age through 2022.",120.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
74118,Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",140.0,97,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
67018,Schramsberg 2007 J. Schram Brut Rosé  (North Coast),"Elegant and almost ethereal, this wine is tantalizing and irresistible. It shows sophistication, from the mysterious, earthy bouquet to the complex, well-aged brioche and peach flavors, as well as the almost gentle texture and refined finish. While full bodied, the wine has great balance, as all the tasty components join together to weave their magic.",150.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
37392,Staglin 2007 INEO Red (Napa Valley),"Here's a young, strong, vigorous wine that needs cellar time. It's absolutely dry, and hits the palate with numbing tannins. But the blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are intense and concentrated. Earns its high score by the wonderful combination of elegance and potency. Hold until after 2015.",250.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131,above 40
