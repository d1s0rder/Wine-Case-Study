74118,Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",140.0,97,1,0.35485054601442445
45461,Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.",150.0,97,1,0.3374103921219981
115017,Trefethen 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least.",50.0,97,1,0.325072404320271
1421,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2008 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry.

109829,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2008 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined. If you can keep your hands off it, this is a wine to cellar for many years.",195.0,97,1,0.31148817737366724
50993,Mauro 2011 VS Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Lusty aromas of black cherry and blackberry are powerful. Likewise, this Tempranillo from just outside the Ribera del Duero district tastes bullish, with blackberry, currant, mocha and rich oak flavors. Robust berry fruit along with spice and chocolate are the lead flavors on a strong, dense finish. This has the potential to age nicely for seven to 15 years. Drink through 2030.",100.0,96,1,0.4038857163807776
41072,ONX 2015 Reckoning Red (Templeton Gap District),"A booming but expertly balanced wine, this blend of 54% Syrah, 18% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Grenache shows aromas of black currant, black olive, black cherry, sweet woody spice and powdered hot cocoa. Elegant mocha and cappuccino notes thrive on the palate, which is brightened by penetrating acidity. It boasts perfectly polished tannins and ripe fig flavors, with a flash of dark chocolate on the finish.",58.0,96,1,0.3662918910869249
52219,Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A dramatic Cabernet, complex and layered, this shows deeply concentrated blackberry essence, black currant, dark chocolate and raisin flaors that are intricately woven with a sweet, smoky oak influence. The tannic structure is thick and furry, but just about perfect. Should age for many years, gradually losing primary fruit, but it's drinkable now after decanting.",150.0,96,1,0.34744259225159185
112735,Harlan Estate 1999 Red (Napa Valley),"An exceptional wine. Fragrant, with plenty of plum, black cherry, cedar and spice aromas. On the palate, it's silky smooth, elegant and fresh, yet packed with complex layers of blackberry, cassis, chocolate, coffee, anise, sage, thyme and cherry flavors. Marked by an exquisite textural elegance and harmonious balance, it displays a fine blend of firm, supple tannins and appropriate acidty that support great length on the finish.",200.0,96,1,0.34410556449660623
37393,Macauley 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A stunningly good Cabernet. Just dazzling in sheer delicious fruit, yet wonderfully structured. So smooth and velvety, flooding the mouth with layers of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, mint, spice and toast. The tannins are thrilling, being firm and soft at the same time. The vineyard sourcing was Star, in Rutherford, and Stagecoach, on Atlas Peak, with a few drops from Beckstoffer To Kalon. Very great now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",72.0,96,1,0.3280762325638562
89592,Colgin 1999 Herb Lamb Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors.

102967,Warre's 2011 Vintage  (Port),"A dark, black-fruited wine, with the fruit hanging off the hard tannins.

35109,Le Macchiole 2006 Paleo Cabernet Franc (Toscana),"This beautiful vintage of Paleo (an oak-aged expression of Cabernet Franc) shows dark, inky intensity and loads of mature black fruit, spice, plum, prune and blackberry. It is extremely smooth and rich with a long-lasting fade that consists of fruit and clove-like flavors. Yet, the tannins are still firm, so put this wine aside in your cellar for at least five years.",125.0,96,1,0.3209772880759942
74178,Crown Point 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Entrepreneur Roger Bower hired Harlan Estate alum Adam Henkel to deliver top-tier wines, and this first release is an extremely auspicious beginning. Black as night in the glass, the wine delivers elegant aromas of olallieberry jam, baking spice, shaved chocolate, beef jerky, teriyaki and purple flowers. The sticky structure will age phenomenally, further concentrating flavors of coffee foam, soy-laced berry sauce, Asian pepper spice, and dense blueberry, black cassis and black plum fruit. Drink 2018–2033.",185.0,96,1,0.3199135567112725
67956,Nickel & Nickel 2009 Martin Stelling Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–15 years.",155.0,96,1,0.31967459029519935
111494,Dominio de Atauta 2006  Ribera del Duero,"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018.",50.0,95,1,0.4278503368215034
5775,Numanthia 2009 Termanthia  (Toro),"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.",200.0,95,1,0.3872860997962424
47129,Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah.",27.0,95,1,0.3843918929051572
107180,Jalits 2013 Diabas Reserve Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"Dark red and black-cherry fruit is clothed in the sumptuous perfume of almost-floral new oak. Toasty oak notes also appear on the fluid and compact body. Juicy black cherry fruit at the core is edged with bright freshness. A touch of white pepper can be glimpsed through the fruit. The structure shows fine tannins, still crunching like starched velvet but beginning to yield. If you like the crunch, drink this wine now, if you like evolution, it will reward patience. The core of brilliant cherry and bluebery fruit promises to continue shining. Drink now–2030.",55.0,95,1,0.3732247632378926
38995,CVNE 2010 Pagos de Viña Real  (Rioja),"CVNE's top wines from 2010 are outstanding across the board. This sun-baked wine is bursting with black cherry, blackberry, spice, vanilla and cedary aromas. A tight, exact and fresh palate blends richness and balance, while ripe blackberry, cassis and black pepper flavors finish with a pure feel, a touch of buttery oak, and nuances of licorice and herbs. Drink this modern beauty through 2025.",110.0,95,1,0.37154834976978496
