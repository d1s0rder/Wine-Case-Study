105758,Mt. Brave 2008 Merlot (Mount Veeder),"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.",60.0,98,4,0.957129408264478
104000,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer Las Piedras Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This bold, broad-shouldered wine shows focused truffle, gravel and cassis flavors.

40691,Darioush 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Smoky leather and cigar make for a formidable entry on the nose before huge, layered tannins rise to the fore.

34843,Hall 2010 Exzellenz Sacrashe Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Made from 100% Cab, the grapes once again show what the vineyard, in the hills east of the Silverado Trail, can do.

Drink now, after careful decanting, and through 2020.",200.0,95,4,0.9357010479065684

Two years in new French oak give it a youthful, tannic nature around smoky black cherry, burly leather and full-bodied richness and concentration. Further time in the bottle should coax out the blackberry and cherry; cellar through 2027.",240.0,95,4,0.920834393035504

Based on Cabernet, with small quantities of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it has oak-influenced black and red currant, cassis, cherry, spicy plum pudding and sweet, smoky vanilla flavors, with a cedar, pencil-lead note reminiscent of a fine Pauillac.

108419,Heitz 2010 Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"The mighty Martha's spends three-and-a-half years aging in French Limousin oak barrels. It has years to go, its structure so expertly captured in the bottle, yet still willing to impart a lightness of sage and sarsaparilla, the tannins firm and integrated, with slight hints of cigar, coconut and that ever-famous mint.
