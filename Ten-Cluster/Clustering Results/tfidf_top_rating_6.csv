6571,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",70.0,97,6,0.5487735987952809
1424,Williams Selyem 2009 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists.

Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.",82.0,97,6,0.5065116079483925
36014,Williams Selyem 2010 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022.

68934,Flowers 2011 Sea View Ridge Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017.",65.0,95,6,0.47275580621397956
95751,De Loach 2009 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones.

79608,Sanford 2010 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a fancy restaurant-style Pinot Noir. That means it's dry, silky and rich, and has that elusive, undefinable quality of elegance that can accompany the finest Pinot-friendly foods, such as steak, lamb, grilled tuna or a wild mushroom risotto. It's tantalizingly crisp, with complex cherry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now and through 2016.",60.0,94,6,0.5094291669124181
6041,Roar 2008 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Just exquisite, combining power with elegance to produce a truly great Pinot Noir.

Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity. It's easy to fall in love with this wine and drink it now, but it can develop interesting complexities through 2020. The winery is Oregon-based and has a good history with Willamette Valley Pinot Noir.",50.0,94,6,0.4526630071460322
62913,Standish 2010 Triangle Block Day Ranch Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A distinguished Pinot Noir, dry, crisp in acidity and complex in flavor.

42446,La Follette 2009 Van Der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Earns its high score by virtue of sheer power. Just explodes in the mouth with raspberry and cherry fruit, as well as spicy complexities of cola, red licorice and smoky oak.

99638,Samsara 2009 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a barnyardy funkiness to this Pinot Noir that is frankly fascinating.

Earthy tannins and brisk acidity guarantee that this wine will age well through 2016.",48.0,93,6,0.474690355949404
36322,De Loach 2009 van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"An interesting Pinot Noir, showing a bit of heat, but whose flavors are taut and complex. The usual cherries and cola you find in almost all California Pinot Noirs are grounded with meaty notes, like grilled hamburger, finished with a splash of tamari. Such are the tannins and acids that the wine should age gracefully for a good eight years, but you can drink it now.",45.0,93,6,0.46980170611914907
