80394,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too. Drink 2022–2040.",66.0,97,6,0.9763115553079007
308,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",775.0,97,6,0.9549915198788034
80401,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037.",38.0,96,6,0.9709644501359463
8896,Kuentz-Bas 2015 Geisberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful. Its inherent grace will only increase with time. Drink 2020–2037.",42.0,96,6,0.9639901795573979
107174,Salomon-Undhof 2009 Bienenfeld Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040.",38.0,96,6,0.9590807148411972
98024,Bründlmayer 2013 Heiligenstein Reserve Lyra Riesling (Kamptal),"Beautifully lifted, almost sublimated apple and citrus fruit combine to make a perfumed, appetizing nose. That pure apple theme continues on the concentrated palate that sings with purity to leave a satisfying and honest impression of completeness. Pure and simply very delicious.",35.0,96,6,0.9571368276476718
78042,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone.",65.0,96,6,0.9499920973855877
98026,Franz Hirtzberger 2013 Singerriedl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate. This is fruit-framed, citrus-focused joy, combining immense concentration with immense elegance. There is a long and exciting life ahead of this.",99.0,96,6,0.949987309992033
48618,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Ried Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030.",64.0,96,6,0.9499861256090677
53710,Boeckel 2015 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037.",38.0,95,6,0.9718713473843151
109772,Franz Hirtzberger 2015 Kirchweg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),An appetizing top note of candied lemon peel hovers over the glass before spicy hints of pear peel become apparent. The palate is edged with very precise zesty grapefruit hints that frame and corset a most generously white-pepper-spiced host of pear and yellow plum fruit. It is the structure of that zesty acidity that make this luminous and appetizing. This is rich but concentrated; delicious now but built to last. Drink 2017–2035.,48.0,95,6,0.9718647074443365
74187,Rosenhof 2015 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),"The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length.",30.0,95,6,0.9699958002224919
88999,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2014 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast. This is an aromatic marvel. The finish is dry and intense. This will keep your interest for years. Drink now through 2035.",41.0,95,6,0.9699948154564872
89004,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2014 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.",43.0,95,6,0.9699937810291908
109774,Malat 2015 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"A subdued nose has the gentle lift of lemon oil and fresh lemon zest. The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction. The lovely long finish is reminiscent of Seville orange and pink grapefruit.",48.0,95,6,0.9699932666304056
78057,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035.",50.0,95,6,0.9689583476069098
88992,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035.",44.0,95,6,0.9689558998469961
53703,Sugrue Pierre Ltd. 2010 The Trouble with Dreams Sparkling (England),"Beautifully delineated fruit constitues the nose, with ripe, yellow plum playing alongside crisp, green apple. The palate layers a sonorous tone of sourdough bread with rich hints of yeast, green-apple briskness and gentle yellow plum. The notions unite with the fizzing, fine mousse. On the midpalate and the finish, the depth of this wine becomes clear: Profound and rich but in a totally slender, unassuming and convincing fashion. The finish is pure and lasting. Drink 2017–2027.",80.0,95,6,0.9678480526647578
92142,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Liebenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Perfumed peach is edged with citrus, yeast and a hint of pepper on a very enticing nose. The palate tinges the fruit with far more savoriness: the full force of yeasty spice, something herbal and salty and incredibly moreish. Citrus also provides a wonderfully high-toned dimension that suggests pink grapefruit zest and kumquats. This is toned, concentrated and full of verve.",62.0,95,6,0.9666605015322567
24006,Franz Hirtzberger 2015 Hochrain Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Wonderfully concentrated notes of ripe mirabelle plums open up on the nose. There also is a heady lemon note. The palate is rich with the same fleshy ripe fruit but has a fault line of zesty orange at its core that provides focus and seems to illuminate clouds of ripe aromatic citrus at every turn. This shimmers with tangerine and clementine. The body is immensely concentrated but has total direction and drive. Enjoy 2020–2040.,68.0,95,6,0.9666595909296278
