23808,Meander 2006 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish. The flavors are of black currants and smoky new oak. The Morisoli Vineyard has been home to very good, ageable bottlings from the likes of Sequoia Grove and Elyse, but in the last few years, Meander has expressed its terroir best. Try after 2012.This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish.

20582,Windstream 2012 Sarmento Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"While this bottling is always interesting, it is dependent on vintage conditions. This bottling, from the excellent 2012 harvest, is Windstream's best ever, a provocative example of a cool-climate Pinot from a fine vineyard in an excellent year. It's bone dry, tart in acidity and hugely complex, offering layers of raspberry sour candy, cherry-pie filling, persimmons, tobacco spices and just a touch of smoky oak. The mouthfeel is silky and delightful. As good as this wine is, give it at least until 2018 to develop further.",40.0,91,5,0.9756695545662954
261,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",34.0,92,5,0.974280758647961
31560,Williams Selyem 2005 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.",72.0,93,5,0.974278018449311
9940,Stonegate 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time.",25.0,92,5,0.9718701145623551
48892,Rocca 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"An interesting wine. It comes from a southerly part of Napa Valley many consider too cool for fine Cab. But this was a warm vintage. The result is very ripe fruit, wrapped in robust, hard tannins that make the wine too young to drink now. The blackberry, currant, cherry and new oak flavors are delicious, but this Cab needs at least through 2008 to come into its own, and will be better after 2010.",60.0,90,5,0.9718689244139698
36014,Williams Selyem 2010 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley.",125.0,97,5,0.9709637975398236
73350,Black Coyote 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Tasted blind in a large group of Napa Valley Cabernets, this one stood out for sheer power and authority. It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020.",85.0,97,5,0.9709610403156393
58469,Thomas Fogarty 2006 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Feels classy and vital from the very start and all the way through. Lots of ripe, complex, bone-dry blackberry, cherry, cola, cassis, herb, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy. Even nearing five years of age, the tannins are significant, giving the wine a tough astringency. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the tannins. If you drink now, give it a good, long decant.",34.0,91,5,0.9699941049733665
94148,Matrix 2009 Reserve Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow.",56.0,92,5,0.9699940072143786
64316,Demetria 2006 Cuvée Sandra Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This best-of-barrels reserve shows a richness and complexity that make for compelling drinking. A mixture of several clones and selections of Pinot Noir, the wine has firm tannins, but the burst of cherries, red currants, root beer and sweet smoky oak gives it a supple, mouth-filling quality. Delicious now with decanting, and should hold and improve through 2012.",75.0,92,5,0.9689600865442133
52217,Paul Hobbs 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a pinnacle of the modern style of winemaking in Napa Valley. The tannins are strong but not aggressive. The acidity is just enough to provide balance for the tremendously rich blackberry, black currant, Kahlua and olive flavors. The oak is powerful, but the wine wears it easily. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. And although the alcohol is high, it's not impossible. You can drink it now, although the tannins could benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar.",275.0,96,5,0.9689583935555561
27827,La Jota Vineyard 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A dazzling Merlot, rich and complex, offering immediately appealing waves of cherry pie, red currant, cola, mocha, brown sugar, cinnamon and sweet oak. Even though the tannins are thick, they're as soft as velvet. The structural integrity of this wine is pure Napa Valley and makes the wine particularly fine.",55.0,92,5,0.9689549907200443
114364,Calera 2008 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This fine Pinot Noir easily holds its own when tasted against far more expensive bottlings. It's softly silky and delicately structured and enormously rich, offering delicious waves of raspberries, cherries, oranges, cola, beef jerky and black pepper. A perfect Pinot Noir to drink now. Easy to find, with nearly 13,000 cases produced.",24.0,91,5,0.9689526614124241
19081,Adelaida 2006 Reserve The Glenrose Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"Pretty much as good as Paso Robles Syrah gets. Shows incredibly fine tannic structure and ripe, luscious flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cola, cocoa, bacon and sweet, smoky sandalwood from oak barrels. Pull it back a little in fruit, and it's near perfect. Drink now.",55.0,91,5,0.9678523070342135
2416,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",45.0,90,5,0.9678510849125359
60025,Anthill 2005 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is in Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation. You'll find very high acidity and an austere, elegant wine in this extremely low-yield Pinot Noir. The flavors are right on the edge, balancing less ripe peppermint and tannic Chinese-tea notes with richer cherries and raspberries. This is really a thrilling young wine, and while it may hold for years, it's best now for its tense youth.",43.0,93,5,0.9678507821780622
74225,Etude 2007 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years.",60.0,95,5,0.9678505473242676
86641,Freeman 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"An elegant, elaborate Pinot Noir, clearly well grown. The structure is impeccable, with brisk, citrusy acidity and finely ground tannins. The flavors show long hangtime ripeness, flooding the mouth with raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic pie spices. There's even a note of balsam and mushrooms. Very fine now, with decanting, but should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",41.0,92,5,0.9678500879748423
9310,Cambria 2010 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a big, fleshy wine, with evident tannins and acidity that give it bite and structure. The flavors are ripe and pure, suggesting red and black cherry pie filling, with lots of dusty spice and a hint of sweet oak. It will be very nice now and over the next 4–5 years. And with more than 22,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",25.0,91,5,0.9678474259701182
65598,MacPhail 2009 Raye's Hill Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A sweet, soft, harmonious Pinot Noir. Feels so gentle in the mouth, it hardly has any weight, yet it's a very serious wine. The flavors are enormous, suggesting ripe wild cherries, raspberry liqueur and baking spices, finished with perfectly applied, smoky oak, and brightened with fine acidity. A wine of great charm, it should continue to develop in the bottle for six years.",49.0,94,5,0.9678459497192847
67722,Testarossa 2009 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",59.0,93,5,0.9666616999089396
61348,Papapietro Perry 2007 Timbercrest Farms Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Zin doesn't get bigger or riper than this. Floods the mouth with flamboyant blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. It's tannic and dry, but so fruity it's almost sweet. High alcohol aids in the impression of sweetness. Oaky, too, in the way of a Cabernet. Delicious and classic Dry Creek.",45.0,91,5,0.9666611337445277
21366,Pine Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"So ripe and beautiful in fruit and oak, so balanced in tannins and acids, that it's hard to know whether to enjoy this Cab now or age it. Right now, it's elaborate in blackberry, cherry, currant and new oak flavors, wrapped into insanely fine tannins. But it's also balanced enough to develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",85.0,93,5,0.9666606832085296
6770,Atmosphere 2008 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",60.0,91,5,0.966660020816546
76420,Harbison Wines 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So deliciously ripe and sweet, you can drink it now, especially with a great steak. Flatters with raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors, accented with the vanilla and caramel of new oak, and wrapped into soft, ripe tannins. Made in the modern style, it's a decadent wine whose pure, refined tannins testify to their Napa origin. Yet it will develop over the next ten years.",90.0,94,5,0.9666584414779599
66275,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series La Encantada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Paso Robles-based Adelaida is better known for Rhône varieties, but they can turn out a pretty good Pinot Noir, if they can get their hands on good grapes. Now, through their Vineyard Series, they've obtained Encantada fruit, with excellent results. The wine is ripe in cherries and raspberries, yet has deeper, earthier notes of mushrooms, cola and herbs, finished with spices. It's a very fine bottle that's ready to drink now, and should develop over the next six years.",40.0,91,5,0.9666583024716898
108212,Shafer 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.",50.0,91,5,0.9666577860575857
80796,Sojourn 2011 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a complex Pinot Noir, dry and silky, showing the delicate structure of the coast in a cool vintage. The alcohol is relatively modest and the acidity is crisp, giving good balance to the flavors that range from cranberries, cola and pomegranates to sweet sautéed mushrooms, mocha and exotic baking spices. Drink this lovely wine now–2019.",59.0,92,5,0.9666574542998291
81518,Lynmar 2007 Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",60.0,93,5,0.9653806191406598
42379,Williams Selyem 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",75.0,99,5,0.9653791952239914
99958,Atlas Peak 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Fruit stars in this young, rich Cabernet. It's as good as young, drink-me-now Napa Cab gets, offering waves of blackberries, cherries, plums, sweet oak and spices that go on and on into long finish. The tannins are perfectly ripe, the acidity fine and brisk.",35.0,90,5,0.9653790358656078
23794,William Hill Estate 2007 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Needs time in the cellar, as it's really tough in tannins now. Feels hard and sandpapery and raspingly dry. Deep down inside is a molten core of ripe blackberries and black currants, with lots of new, smoky oak. Seems to be your classically ageable Napa red. Give it until at least 2013, and it could surprise and delight for many years beyond.",125.0,93,5,0.9653789445026081
40903,Ravenswood 2007 Old Hill Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",60.0,95,5,0.9653789203120772
88180,Tudal 2009 Legacy Lot 30 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Some Napa Cabs that are ageable also are good to go now because the fruit is so ripe and the tannins are soft. Not this one. It's almost old-fashioned in tannins, with a lockdown astringency. But it's balanced and elegant, and the flavors are rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa and sweet oak. Give it at least six years in the cellar, and it could go for another 10 or 15.",115.0,92,5,0.9653788420722872
62910,Yates Family Vineyard 2006 Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Hard to imagine greater concentration in a Napa Cabernet than you'll find here. It's just insanely rich in blackberries and blueberries and liberally oaked, while the tannins are hard and potent. Nowhere near ready now, even though it's already more than five years old. Give it at least six years in a good cellar, and it could easily go another decade beyond that.",65.0,93,5,0.9653788103492719
62196,Hanzell 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record.",95.0,94,5,0.9653784736844375
67957,Foxen 2010 Sea Smoke Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious.",85.0,96,5,0.9653784685163407
37391,Reynolds Family Winery 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade.",89.0,96,5,0.965378223819818
61945,Talisman 2009 Spring Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's no doubt that this is an exceptionally ripe, delicious Pinot Noir. It's rich in black cherry pie and red currant flavors that sink in deep and last into a long, spicy finish. Brisk acidity and dusty tannins provide fortunate balance. Good as it is now, you might want to age it for six years and see what it does.",42.0,89,5,0.9653771798905795
23803,Goldschmidt 2007 Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A very fine Cabernet, although it's tough and young and wants time in the cellar. Strikes you immediately as lush and important, with a fine structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, anise, dark chocolate and sandalwood. Yet there's a juvenile character that, good as it is, promises even better things down the road. Give it until 2013, at least.",70.0,93,5,0.9653771692457256
25566,Lynmar 2009 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",70.0,96,5,0.9653770922516343
3455,Roar 2011 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A gigantic Pinot Noir, rich and heady in black cherries, sweet licorice, bacon, mocha and toasty oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins and brightened with crisp Santa Lucia acidity. It's a dramatic wine, but too young. Give it at least four years for all the parts to begin to come together.",52.0,93,5,0.965376825159801
46672,Aurielle 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very ripe and jammy, showing primary fruit blackberries, cherries, black currants and cola, and lots of new, smoky oak. A big wine wrapped into big, sweet tannins that's tasting a bit direct now. The suggestion is ageability. With the grapes coming off two mountains, Howell and Veeder, it should cruise through the next 6–8 years.",90.0,90,5,0.9653767381611681
111241,V. Sattui 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",35.0,90,5,0.9653762563403004
41528,Dutton-Goldfield 2012 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is the winery's first Pinot of the vintage. Hence it's a preview of their 2012s to come, and what promise it holds. The acidity is high and the alcohol is low, making for an elegant mouthfeel. But what's especially pleasurable are the deep flavors of black cherries, blueberries, red currants and sandalwood. The wine is fine to drink now, and should hold in the bottle until 2022. What a superb barbecued steak pairing.",40.0,92,5,0.9653753174959009
66715,Marimar Estate 2005 Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Marimar's Don Miguel Pinot Noir typically starts out as a tannic, fairly closed young wine that needs some bottle age. The '05, from a cool vintage, accentuates that tightness, offering a slightly bitter wine housing cherry, currant, cola, mocha and oak flavors. It's very dry and complex, and will easily age for many years.",42.0,91,5,0.9653748285713216
28619,Duckhorn 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Classic Duckhorn, which is to say, dry, tannic, elegantly structured and expensive. The winemaker succeeded, in this so-so year, in crafting a rich, nuanced wine of considerable interest. It may not be a longterm ager, but it's delicious now, with deep flavors of blackberries, red currants, violets, cocoa and smoky oak, balanced with the prettiest acidity. Grows better in the glass as it breathes.",85.0,94,5,0.9653746833641516
53749,Bjornstad 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"A fancy Pinot Noir from this coveted vineyard. The wine is very rich and slightly high in alcohol, offering deep flavors of oak-inspired raspberry jam, softened cola and bacon, brightened with crisp acidity and chewy in finely-ground tannins. Lovely to drink now, but try giving it 4–5 years for all the parts to knit together.",50.0,93,5,0.9653738432425403
60550,Andrew Murray 2008 McGinley Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Give this lush, rich Syrah two or three years to soften and develop in the bottle. It's a very good wine, offering impressive blackberry, blueberry and cherry-pie filling flavors, wrapped into fine acids and tannins. But it's fresh and young and will get better. Better well into 2011.",36.0,90,5,0.9653616718115202
3897,W.H. Smith 2007 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.",48.0,89,5,0.9639952584615963
41802,Gary Farrell 2007 Starr Ridge Vineyard - Dijon Clones Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A big, young Pinot Noir that shows brilliant stuffing and complexity, but it's rather heavy and tannic now, and not a wine to open before, say, 2011 at the very least. In its youth it displays rich, jammy flavors of red cherries, raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood, and is very dry. Should evolve slowly through 2015 or beyond.",50.0,92,5,0.9639944892699344
99794,Bacio Divino 2007 Janzen Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Marked by sweet, jammy fruit and oak, this wine is quite good, but doesn't show much complexity. It's smooth and silky, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. Could develop bottle complexity down the road, but it's a gamble.",70.0,87,5,0.9639943489792359
2089,Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 113 Syrah (Mount Veeder),"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.",14.0,90,5,0.9639943333780829
40910,Dutton Estate 2008 Dutton-Thomas Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"A powerful, compelling young Pinot Noir notable for its depth of flavor and classic structure. Floods the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cola, sweet pomegranates, persimmons and spices that last long and clean on the finish. For all that, the wine is thoroughly dry, with firm, fine tannins. Try to age it until at least 2011, if you can.",52.0,94,5,0.9639937647711733
85375,Kunde 2010 Sustainably Farmed and Estate Grown Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Zinfandel combines the variety's classic flavors of spices, briary wild summer blackberries and raspberries, cola and licorice with Merlot-like silky balance and elegance. While there's a wonderful sweetness, the finish is dry. An absolute steal, and relatively easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",22.0,91,5,0.9639935856964824
13057,Gary Farrell 2007 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Very rich and dramatic, a fine Pinot, and it's nice to see this veteran winery continue at such a high level. With a near-perfect structure of acidity and tannins, it offers lush flavors of cherries, raspberries, cotton candy, sweet vanilla, granola and cinnamon spices. Grows better and better in the glass.",50.0,94,5,0.96399350126893
39930,Chimney Rock 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is Chimney Rock's best Stags Leap Cabernet since the 2005, and continues a string of successful vintages. Dry and smooth and silky in the mouth, it's pretty tannic, but very rich, offering waves of cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and sweet cedar flavors. Absolutely delicious, wonderfully elegant, and should age well for a decade.",61.0,94,5,0.9639934925992345
67437,B Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Considering the price of some Oakville Cabs, this one's a value. It's quite a good wine, rich and tannic and oaky and ripe, offering appealing blackberry, black cherry, black currant and smoky oak flavors that finish dry and spicy. Should develop over the next 3–5 years, although it seems to lack the stuffing for the long haul.",45.0,91,5,0.9639934083293865
110663,Twomey 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A very fine Pinot Noir that shows deep, impressively ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, red currant, licorice and Asian spices, with a rich coating of smoky oak. It's entirely dry, and has a brisk scour of acidity. Seems best now and for the next few years.",50.0,91,5,0.9639930368292126
99635,Mario Perelli-Minetti 2005 Miriam Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows the lush richness, dryness and complexity you want in a fine Napa Valley Cabernet. At more than six years of age, the tannins are just beginning to resolve, although they're still pretty fierce.

55725,Three Sticks 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"A seriously good Cabernet that advances the cause of Sonoma Valley.

Shows enough acidity and tannin structure to provide balance. Drink now with a good steak, chop or lamb dish.",70.0,91,5,0.9639924096216576

20280,Veedercrest 2005 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A gorgeous Cabernet, and at this price, a bargain. Shows the greatness of the 2005 vintage, with perfectly ripe red and black cherry fruit, sweetly ripe tannins and a fine edge of acidity. Complex for drinking now, it should continue to develop bottle nuances over the next six years until it slowly winds down.",40.0,94,5,0.9639919580566385
96550,Keenan 2007 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"Just delicious, an important, elegant Merlot to drink with the finest steaks and chops.

33642,Barnett 2006 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Barnett is better known as a producer of very good Cabernet. But their Chardonnays can be great, and so can  their Pinot Noirs. This single-vineyard bottling has the elegance of the best Anderson Valley Pinots, a dry, crisp wine of great complexity. The flavors of cherries, licorice, Dr. Pepper, sweet Chinese tea and bacon are delicious and compelling.",52.0,93,5,0.9639913685408628
23547,Arista 2009 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"An elegant Pinot Noir, dry, silky and crisp in acidity, making it a natural for lamb chops or a grilled steak.

53256,Hunnicutt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"One sip is all it takes to delight. This wine screams Napa Cabernet with every nuance. Few wines achieve this richness of fruit and tannins. It floods the mouth with blackberry jam, chocolate and cassis liqueur flavors, wrapped into firm but supple tannins, and brightened with a squirt of citrusy acidity. Beautiful now, and should develop over the next decade.",85.0,94,5,0.9639902396384629
23799,EnRoute 2008 Les Pommiers Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.",50.0,93,5,0.9639902030127869
79849,Sinatra Family 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Superripe, showing a direct, crowd-pleasing appeal with its array of oak-inspired blackberries, cherries, sweet currants and chocolate. The structure is gorgeous Napa, with near-perfect tannins and just-in-time acidity. Shows a juvenile fruity sweetness, but is not particularly subtle now, just all power. The gamble is in the cellar. Try after 2012.",95.0,88,5,0.9639898734685479
5651,Captûre 2010 Révélation Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",140.0,94,5,0.9639879160766947
74222,Gainey 2008 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.",48.0,95,5,0.9639859169330716
32592,Duckhorn 2005 Three Palms Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Duckhorn's Three Palms bottling is one of the oldest and most consistent Merlot vineyard designations in California and this is a classic example. The wine always is very tannic. But the '05 is dry and rich and complex in mineral-laden cherries and currants, with just the right application of new oak. You can decant it now for several hours and enjoy with a dramatically charred steak, but it will develop beautifully through 2011, at least.",85.0,94,5,0.9639847591003832
27893,J.R. Carter 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.",80.0,93,5,0.9624943577932974

45472,Oakville East 2005 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years.",125.0,95,5,0.9624939677202825
30861,Williams Selyem 2007 Peay Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Pretty tannic, with a hard edge, although it's very fruity and rich, and should soften and mellow with time in the cellar. Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around.",54.0,95,5,0.9624936392219362
112749,Talley 2000 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Extraordinarily rich, complex and delicious,  this wine defines a ripe approach to cool-climate Pinot Noir. In its youthful state, it's plastered over with smoky oak, but below that are abundant ripe red and black cherry flavors. Near-perfect acids and tannins create wonderful balance and harmony in this ageworthy wine. Cellar Selection.",60.0,92,5,0.962493398008433
3484,Rusack 2008 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins.

35266,Janzen 2008 Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A wine to cellar. With powerful tannins and near perfect balance, it's extraordinarily ripe and rich in blackberries and currants, with hints of minerals and spices. Very dry, it feels vital from the first taste to the long finish. The vineyard is north of Yountville, which puts it in a cooler area. Should develop bottle complexity over the next decade.",100.0,93,5,0.9624930649027368
87417,Castello di Amorosa 2010 Melanson Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The vineyard isn't well known, but it's on Pritchard Hill, near much more famous sources of Cabernet. It's a deceptive wine, so rich and flamboyant in sweet, jammy blackberries and cherries, chocolate and licorice, you want to drink the whole bottle. Yet it has the tannin-acid balance to age, possibly for a long time. Made from 100% Cab, yet produced in tiny quantities, it shows the Pritchard signature of youthful deliciousness combined with ageability.",145.0,92,5,0.9624930176322075
61913,Ledson 2003 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Held back, for some reason, for more than six years, this wine is showing beautifully now.

43075,Steven Kent 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This is a beautiful, intricate and appealing Cabernet to drink with upscale fare, like a very fine steak. It's bone dry, but very rich and sweet in blackberry, cherry and currant fruit, and there's a nice cut of acidity for balance. Steven Kent is producing today's greatest Livermore Cabernets, wines that hearken back to the valley's roots as one of California's best wine regions. Drink now–2013.",45.0,93,5,0.9624927180205264
73361,Rodney Strong 2007 Rockaway Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Made from 100% Cabernet grown in a hilly part of the valley, this wine is tight and dry in tannins. It's so astringent, it's nearly impossible to enjoy now. Yet it's extraordinarily rich and explosive in blackberry tart, black cherry pie and cassis flavors, and feels dramatic in the mouth. Should easily improve over the next decade. Hold until 2013.",75.0,94,5,0.9624922851728354
21798,Charles Krug 2010 Family Reserve Generations Estate Red (Napa Valley),"A lovely wine, soft and supple, with a superb tannin structure framing the most interesting and delicious flavors.

Not an ager, but an elegant Napa Valley wine to drink now and over the next few years.",50.0,92,5,0.9624919684169082
5902,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol. The flavors are remarkably rich and ripe in cherries, currants and cola, with savory hints of mint and cocoa. Displays a great balance of acids, tannins and oak. Great now and for a decade.",38.0,93,5,0.9624918561055968

The high alcohol is not out of place.",35.0,92,5,0.9624918148041132
79720,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Heideboden Zweigelt (Burgenland),"Zweigelt can do easy-drinking styles but in the right hands, it can also turn into something more elegant. That's the case here: This exudes sophistication. Subtle use of oak supports the supple structure and gives the ripe red cherry fruit a more velvety spin. While this is ready now, it may well get even better with a year or two in bottle.",26.0,90,5,0.962491618937035

113174,Bialla 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A terrific Cabernet that gives all the richness and opulence you expect in an expensive Napa Cab, yet controls it with firm tannins, acidity, minerals and earthiness. Explosive in blackberry and cherry-pie filling and chocolate granola-bar flavors that are so delicious, you can't stop reaching for another glass. The grapes come 100% from the winery's Atlas Peak appellation vineyard.",125.0,94,5,0.962491612117714
46499,Blue Rock 2010 Best Barrels Merlot (Alexander Valley),"This wine might knock your socks off with massively rich, ripe flavors of cherry pie, blueberry jam, mocha and toasty oak, wrapped into ultra-smooth tannins. For all the richness, it's brightened with just enough acidity for balance and finishes dry. There's no reason not to drink it now. Production was only 96 cases, but it's worth a search.",60.0,92,5,0.9624915887877108

25530,Clos Pegase 2003 Palisades Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance.

6041,Roar 2008 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Just exquisite, combining power with elegance to produce a truly great Pinot Noir. The vineyard is in the heart of the appellation.

79606,Piña 2009 Firehouse Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Cabernets just don't get much richer, riper or deeper than this single-vineyard beauty. Dry, tannic and fine in acidity, it's a full-frontal assault of blackberries, cassis liqueur and new oak, concentrated beyond belief. The sheer magnitude demands time in the cellar. Try after 2015, and it could go far beyond that.",85.0,94,5,0.9624904113627051
61349,Peterson 2005 Bradford Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is an enormously fruity Zinfandel that offers a flood of flavor, making it instantly likeable.

45988,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.",100.0,95,5,0.9624899816532472

78400,Longoria 2010 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.",48.0,92,5,0.962488685080488
113626,Transcendence 2009 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is high in alcohol, but it will easily pair with barbecue.

Their Reserve is even better, showing a more dramatic structure of smooth, complex tannins and a more intense, fruity profile. Offers lavish waves of blackberries, black currants, cassis, smoky oak and minerals, with notes of chocolate and cappuccino. Delicious now and through 2013.",60.0,93,5,0.9624843388286725
114378,Merry Edwards 2007 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",54.0,97,5,0.962484214891321
3994,Cline 2015 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price.

1433,Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",78.0,96,5,0.9608661018828376
19291,W.H. Smith 2005 Purple Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Bill Smith is better known for his Pinot Noirs, but he founded La Jota and knows a thing or two about Howell Mountain Cabs. This is a big, dry, tannic mountain wine, virtually undrinkable now for its hard astringency. However, it's a fine cellar candidate. Brims with ripe blackberries and cherries that just need time. Should begin to open in 2008, and develop for another 8 years or so.",54.0,93,5,0.9608654017476057
2026,Pessagno 2009 Four Boys Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"You know you're dealing with a great Pinot Noir when it's this delicious right out of the bottle, yet will age.

97217,Beaucanon 2009 Longwood Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A charming young Cabernet, this is rich in blackberry, currant and anise flavors that are complex and interesting. It's a very dry wine, but the fruit is so polished, it seems almost sweet. This is delicious now, although it's pretty tannic and could develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",32.0,90,5,0.9608645555868125
36321,De Loach 2009 OFS Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A very fine Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, but it needs a little time in the cellar. That's due to the tannins, which are thick and noticeable in the way they create an astringency through the finish. The flavors are exceptionally rich, suggesting cherries, raspberries and tobacco, with a welcome sweetness from toasty oak.",40.0,93,5,0.9608645461310175
74117,Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",70.0,97,5,0.9608644931964497
64179,Chappellet 2009 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Another terrific Signature Cabernet from Chappellet. This has primary blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with an additional note of toasty oak. The tannins and acids are excellent, lending structure to the richness. The result is a wonderfully-complex Napa Cabernet that should develop over the next six years.",49.0,93,5,0.9608642287169611
69905,Clif Family 2009 Kit's Killer Cab Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The winery's Kit's Killer is a dependably good Cabernet, almost always showing lots of richness and complexity. They raised the price by $2 since last vintage, but it's still a very fine wine, with delicious blackberry, currant and licorice flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink over the next few years.",40.0,92,5,0.9608641733400624
91016,Martin Ray 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A fine, fancy Cabernet. It shows Diamond Mountain's famously hard tannins, but they're so finely ground, the wine is actually drinkable now, with a brief decant. It's entirely dry, with complex waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, violets, mocha, minerals and, of course, plenty of sweet smoky oak.",50.0,92,5,0.9608641006677877
74667,Von Strasser 2008 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A big, hard, dry Cabernet whose mountain tannins need quite some time to resolve. Right now they're tough as nails, although the blackberry fruit is so brilliant and intense, it punches right through. Give this dramatic wine at least six years, and it could well develop beyond the next decade.",70.0,94,5,0.960863582060857
101364,Benovia 2008 Bella Una Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a good, solid Pinot Noir, a little rustic and direct, but offering lots of drinking pleasure. It's dry and silky, with rich black cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink over the next year or two.",56.0,88,5,0.9608635014906474
102873,Hartford Court 2011 Old Vine Jolene's Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"If you're tired of Zinfandels that are unabalanced and inelegant, try this one. Yes, the alcohol is high, but it folds perfectly into everything else. The vineyard is in the Olivet Road part of the valley, which in many ways represents the ideal terroir of the Russian River. You'll find brisk acidity and firm tannins in this wine, but also ripely appealing blackberry, cherry, cola and briary wild chamomile flavors. This seriously good wine will age until 2022.",55.0,92,5,0.9608634995416916
35262,Foxen 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A beautiful Pinot, authoritative and masculine, with firm tannins, hard acidity and a bone-dry finish. The core of black cherries, cola, spices and sweet oak is irresistibly good. Compelling now right out of the bottle, and should develop over the next six years.",56.0,93,5,0.9608634844186976
60006,Calcareous 2007 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"Ripe and smooth, with polished cherry pie filling, red currant, cola and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry and the tannins are brisk and astringent. Not likely to develop in the bottle, but fine now with a grilled steak.",34.0,87,5,0.9608634462321386
44328,Flora Springs 2006 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is a big, tough, tannic Cab that needs time in the cellar. Not showing well now due to the astringency, it has a rich heart of black cherries and minerals, liberally enriched with sweet, smoky new oak. Decanting, and pairing against charred beef, will uplift it.",100.0,91,5,0.9608634450285423
67446,WesMar 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful, fine young Pinot Noir that shows off the WesMar style of crisp elegance at a lower price than their single-vineyard wines. Dry and silky, it feels fine in the mouth, offering rich flavors of cherries, cola and sweet, smoky oak. Now–2012.",35.0,91,5,0.9608633841377034
89208,Charnu 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Dry, dramatic and rich, a Cabernet whose authoritative tannins mark it as classic Napa Valley. Beyond that are ripe blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors that are liberally oaked. Needs some time to come around, although you could drink it now with a good decant. But better 2013–2018.",75.0,91,5,0.9608633812325306
75329,Liparita 2010 V Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Sweet blackberry jam, currant and toasty oak flavors mark this softly tannic Cabernet. It's similar to the high-scoring 2009, with ripe blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, accented with new oak. But it's less complex, and the alcohol is considerably higher. Drink soon.",55.0,87,5,0.960863371407188
62913,Standish 2010 Triangle Block Day Ranch Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A distinguished Pinot Noir, dry, crisp in acidity and complex in flavor. The cherry, raspberry, cola and mushroom flavors are very rich, almost sweet, except that they finish in a dry scour of spices. Defines a young Anderson Valley Pinot, and should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",75.0,93,5,0.9608631773643719
114138,Stewart 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This Pinot shows lots of style and classy elegance. Just past three years of age, it's still delicious in raspberries and cherries, but it's beginning to soften and show earthier, more complex notes of mushrooms and herbs. With a silky texture and fine acidity, it should continue its bottle path for another six years, at least.",50.0,92,5,0.960863133495942
53260,De Loach 2010 Maboroshi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Dazzling with silky richness, this wine is so delicious, you can't help but to fall in love with it. Tantalizing with waves of raspberry and cherry pie, ripe persimmon, mocha, red licorice and smoky oak flavors that finish long and satisfying. The balance of acids and tannins is just about perfect. Calling all steaks for the perfect pairing.",50.0,94,5,0.960863129983556
113405,Regale Winery and Vineyards 2008 O'Neel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale. It has a transparent, silky texture, yet is very rich in cherry pie filling, bacon and Indian spices. Feels beautiful and complex now, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",48.0,92,5,0.9608630723427599
111473,Buehler 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Good price for a Napa Valley Cabernet this distinguished. It's rich and satisfying in blackberry, black currant and blueberry fruit, with a lovely coat of smoky oak. Shows lots of complexity, and the finish is dry and spicy. Could go the distance, but just to be safe, drink over the next six years.",25.0,90,5,0.9608629114897987
39044,Rutherford Grove 2008 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A beautiful Cabernet, dry and rich, with wonderful tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweet, an apparent contradiction the palate loves. Shows near perfect ripeness, an impressive range of blackberries, plums and cassis, and an earthy herbaceousness. May be a little too young for proper enjoyment, so give it a few years in the cellar.",45.0,93,5,0.9608626399689578
53957,Reverie 2005 Estate Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District),"There's a fine wine in here, but it needs a little time for those pesky tannins to soften. They coat the mouth with astringency, making it hard to appreciate the fruit. But the fruit is there, in the form of pure, sweet cherries. It's not a longterm ager, but a year or three in the cellar should make this soft, gentle wine more beautiful.",60.0,90,5,0.9608625901854565
6894,Nicholls 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Gentle and candy ripe, this Cab has pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, red plums, licorice and chocolate, accented with toasty, spicy oak, wrapped into sweet, fine tannins. Too soft for the cellar, so drink up.",85.0,86,5,0.9608625635547322
61743,Storm 2008 Le Bon Climat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years.",40.0,91,5,0.9608624031852111

114140,Barden 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This Pinot is lovely for two reasons. One, it exhibits the tremendous balance and richness of a well-grown Santa Rita Hills Pinot. Secondly, the superb 2012 vintage makes it especially noteworthy. The raspberry and cherry fruit is ripe and fruity, and yet the finish is absolutely dry and complex. So good now, it's hard to recommend cellaring it, but you should, for up to eight years. A new brand from Margerum.",87.0,92,5,0.9608623498492652
69474,Ojai 2005 Roll Ranch Vineyard Syrah (California),"Despite the California appellation, the grapes were grown in the Ojai region of Santa Barbara County. It's a dry, tannic wine whose ripe blackberry, mocha and oak flavors are balanced with rich earthiness. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",45.0,90,5,0.9608620046878861
17833,J. Lohr 2010 Los Osos Merlot (Paso Robles),"This is a beautiful red wine to drink now for its rich, ripe flavors and overall balance.

43072,Dutton Estate 2007 My Father's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"You want lush, plush and opulent in your California Syrah? Here you go. It's soft and intricate, with lacy tannins framing complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, bacon, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. Just delicious now and for the next two to three years.",38.0,93,5,0.9608619429341021
23560,Laurel Glen 2007 Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"A sort of second wine to Laurel Glen's estate Cabernet, this is quite simply a wonderful wine. It's dry, tannic and crisply balanced, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, cola, herbs and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Really compelling, and at this price, a steal in a great coastal California Cabernet.",30.0,92,5,0.9608618540979933
15852,JCB 2010 No. 17 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This is a wonderful wine that has the dry complexity and tannic structure of a great Napa red, with rich layers of cherries, red currants, mocha and sweet smoky oak. Yet it's supple, with a deft drinkability. A brilliant interpretation of the variety, it's hard to keep from popping the cork now, but should age well for 8–10 years.",150.0,94,5,0.9608617727877231
77237,Reverie 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard. But once they start to fall out, the blackberry and currant flavors should emerge, pure and sweet. Best after 2010, but if you open it before that, decant.",65.0,91,5,0.9608617240578257
1288,Marita's Vineyard 2007 SOMA Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.",86.0,93,5,0.9608617048638468
74643,Von Strasser 2008 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),"As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.",125.0,98,5,0.9608616948637672
52120,Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Von Weidlich Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"When Russian River Zinfandel succeeds, and this one does, it marries the variety's wild, feral personality to the valley's perfect terroir to produce distinctive wines. Ottimino's 2005 Von Weidlich is very tannic, but classic in presentation, showing blackberry, currant and intense black pepper aromas and flavors. Might tempt you to cellar it, but it's best over the next year for sheer exuberance.",36.0,92,5,0.9608615411247495
107088,Silver Oak 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A good wine, with jammy Cabernet flavors of blackberries, cassis and savory spices. It's fairly low in alcohol, with a brisk, clean scour, but tannic and astringent. Feels immature even at the age of nearly five years, but it should develop. Give it another six years.",100.0,90,5,0.9608609948225941
19283,Etude 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A lush Cabernet that feels soft and delicious right now, but has layers of complexity that make it a cellar candidate. Dry and oaky, the wine is enormously rich in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and cedar flavors, with considerable tannins. The wine is wonderfully balanced. Drink now through 2010, at least.",90.0,93,5,0.9608609310687786
63815,WesMar 2007 Salzgeber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage. It's marked in youth by brisk acids and forward, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of cherries, cola and spices, with the smoky sandalwood of barrel age. Could develop all kinds of surprises over the next 4–6 years.",50.0,91,5,0.9608608755442042
40908,Paul Lato 2007 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but you don't want to open it anytime soon. Shows the pedigree of this vineyard, a superbly balanced wine rich in acidity and minerals. The fruit? Black and red cherries, blackberries, cola, cocoa powder and red currants, enriched with smoky cedarwood. Beautiful, but needs time. The window is 2011–2013.",70.0,95,5,0.9608605722759869

76528,Bardessono 2006 Maxine's Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little sharp, with a sting throughout, but otherwise a fine, classic Cabernet brimming with flavor. Shows upfront blackberries, currants, chocolate-covered cherries, smoky vanilla and toast, wrapped into smooth, sturdy tannins. Could mellow and soften in the next several years.",33.0,88,5,0.9608603940704993
112875,Testarossa 2010 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"What a delicious Pinot Noir. The cool, long vintage has given it wonderful lightness and acidity, yet also an intensity of fruit that makes it irresistible. Marked by flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, it's a wine to savor now, with Pinot-friendly foods such as lamb and steak.",59.0,92,5,0.9608601012608071
82505,JCB 2010 No. 7 Sonoma Collection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years.",50.0,91,5,0.9608599120681687
56711,Mike Ditka 2010 The Icon Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich and flashy in blackberries, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur, this Cab feels fancy all the way through to the dry, spicy finish. The tannins kick in midway, giving it a scour of astringency that suggests the cellar. Yet it's really too soft and one-dimensional for anything beyond 3–4 years before the fruit dies.",50.0,87,5,0.9608597834014689
78397,Dolina 2011 Rio Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This wine is silky and well-balanced in acids and tannins, with judicious oak influences framing complex cherry, red currant and spice flavors. Feels very rich, yet the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. Coming after the high-scoring 2010 vintage, Dolina's 2011 is fine to drink now, and should develop bottle notes over the next six years or so.",30.0,92,5,0.9608597600629828
94154,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Stuhlmuller's regular 2008 Cabernet, released a year ago, was quite good. This one's even better. It has all the hallmarks of a superior Cabernet, with rich, delicious blackberry, cherry, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola and oak flavors, framed into soft, intricate tannins. With a pleasant minerality, it should age well through 2016, gradually losing fruit.",65.0,92,5,0.9608596159117576
45938,Foxen 7200 2007 Vogelzang Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Lots of rich, ripe fruit in this Cabernet, which comes from the Happy Canyon area of the warmer eastern part of the valley. It shows deliciously forward blackberry, blueberry and cherry flavors, with a sweet overlay of toasty oak and rich, firm tannins. Dry and lovely, it's fine to drink now.",50.0,90,5,0.9608595910511634
72577,Villicana 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is one of the best Paso Cabernets of the vintage. It's dry and smooth in tannins, with an elegant mouthfeel. It's a little on the soft side, and the black currant fruit flavors have an earthy edge of herbs and spicy tobacco. There's some heat from alcohol, but not too much. Should develop over the next 5–6 years.",30.0,90,5,0.9608593260476616
56714,Patz & Hall 2010 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A strong, extracted Pinot, lacking delicacy and finesse. It's enormous in jammy raspberries, cherries and liqueur, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak. High alcohol gives it a full body and a taste of glyceriney sweetness. Many will like its power and flash. Drink it over the next few years.",85.0,87,5,0.9608592621682946
18621,Merry Edwards 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Acidity marks this ripe, delicious wine, giving it a tartness that works to balance the extraordinarily ripe flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, mulberries and pomegranates all mingle together, with spice and cedar complications, and the finish is totally dry and somewhat tannic. Great now, and should hold for a good six years.",36.0,91,5,0.9608591709689366
32196,Calera 2009 Mills Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"This vineyard bottling is very vintage driven. The cool 2009 harvest has made it ripe and tart in cherry pie flavors, but also rather tannic. It's aloof, revealing little of its soul, beyond the primary fruit and oak. Needs time in the cellar. Could really be interesting over the next decade.",45.0,90,5,0.9608587797261313
70417,Morgan 2011 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Vigor and muscularity mark this young Pinot Noir, in the form of vibrant fruit, stringy tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The black cherry, red currant, licorice, sandalwood and pepper flavors are massive, although for all their apparent sweetness, they finish dry. Give it until at least 2018–2019 to begin to mellow.",54.0,91,5,0.9608585514876439
34143,De Loach 2008 Von Weidlich Vineyard Zinfandel (Green Valley),"With a touch of raisins and some heat in the finish, this is a pretty ripe Zinfandel. It's not for the faint-hearted. But it's classic California Zin, offering huge blackberry, cola, mocha and black pepper flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Demands rich fare, especially spicy, saucy barbecue.",32.0,90,5,0.9608585426632498
26695,Stryker Sonoma 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Lots of ripe, lush blackberry and cherry jam, mocha and cassis liqueur flavors in this full-bodied Cab.

22591,Clos du Val 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant. The winery resolutely refuses to kowtow to the modern style of ultraripe, extracted fruit, high alcohol and massive oak. This lovely Cab, which contains a drop of Merlot, defines their style, and is a joy to drink. It has rich, complex cherry and blackberry flavors, flecked with earth and herbs, and is just beginning a long journey. Now–2021, at least.",75.0,94,5,0.9608572346027532
86202,Pessagno 2005 Spring Grove Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County),"This is a high-acid, young Pinot. Bone dry and tart, it has green mint-infused, bitter cherry flavors, and the texture is nice and silky, even elegant. Yet it lacks the sensual opulence you want in a fine Pinot, and doesn't seem likely to age.",27.0,85,5,0.9608571843115284
3305,Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010.",60.0,92,5,0.9608545465328131
36021,Merry Edwards 2010 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is an amazingly complex wine and a fine expression of the cool vintage. Perhaps the most notable feature is acidity; it's strong, almost tingly, and will certainly help the wine age. The flavors are explosive yet refined, with notes of cherries, cola, pomegranates and plums. Good as it is to drink now, you'll want to cellar it until 2018, and it will provide beauty for many additional years.",57.0,95,5,0.9608543434839442
73364,Verité 2006 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),"Lots going on in this mountain-grown wine. It's perfectly dry and strong in tannins, with an elusive quality of excellence that testifies to the best terroir. Showing blackberry, black cherry, mineral and oak flavors, it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next decade.",260.0,94,5,0.9608543369097473
74061,Rutherford Ranch 2005 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"The oak is strong, giving a toasty, charcoal aroma and tannic texture, and the acids and grape tannins likewise contribute to making this wine rather aloof. Underneath are good, complex cherry and raspberry flavors, with an earthy richness approaching chocolate. Seems to have all the parts in place to age. Try around 2012.",70.0,88,5,0.9608514303432446
20569,Longboard 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Longboard shies away from overt fruit in favor of earthier tobacco flavors in this dry, complex and tannic young Pinot Noir. That doesn't mean you won't find plenty of raspberries and cherries. The wine is dry, delicately structured and frankly delicious, making it Longboard's best Pinot Noir ever. Drink now–2019 as it gradually sheds fruit.",33.0,91,5,0.9608511988300247
2729,Sterling 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Just beautiful, this is the best Sterling Reserve Cabernet in years, and a huge improvement over the 2008. It shows ripe, lush flavors of blackberry and black cherry pie, anise, cola and smoky sandalwood, wrapped into sweetly gentle, complex tannins. Drink this beauty over the next six years.",75.0,93,5,0.9590859256465057
44216,Reverie 2009 Estate Petite Verdot (Diamond Mountain District),"This wine is marked by exceptionally ripe, forward flavors of blackberry jam and black currants, with a sweet coating of smoky oak. In fact, flavor is what drives this wine, although it also shows fine, complex Diamond Mountain tannins that give it a dramatic structure. Seems best now and for the next three years.",71.0,91,5,0.959085838012409
8977,Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",37.0,89,5,0.9590857865723896
68099,The Grade 2007 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade.",80.0,92,5,0.9590853795671584
99461,Newton 2007 Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish. Elegant and powerful at the same time, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.",60.0,93,5,0.9590852456888436
79609,Davis Family 2009 Horshehoe Bend Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery's '08 bottling of this Pinot was very good, but this is considerably better. It's rich in red cherries and ripe persimmons, with complex notes of grilled beef, cola and sautéed wild mushrooms, and has a long, spicy finish. A joy to drink now, and it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",45.0,94,5,0.9590851961175282
23281,Hess Collection 2004 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Production was 10,000 cases, amazing when you consider how good this mountain wine is. Immediately drinkable for the soft purity of the tannins and complex cassis, chocolate and oak flavors, it has the sturdy structure to develop for some years, but is best now for its elegant purity. Hess is on a real Cabernet roll, and is one of Napa's overlooked stars.",50.0,92,5,0.9590851607284835

57472,Round Pond 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"There's a pure, sweet Cabernet in the bottle that wants to come out, but it's held back right now with sturdy tannins that make for a palate astringency. The flavors are explosive, of blackberries, cassis, cherries, chocolate and smoky new oak. Needs time. Best after 2011 and well beyond.",60.0,91,5,0.95908514404867
47493,Spellbound 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"A great example of Lodi Zin, at a great price. Shows real complexity in the blackberry, cherry, mulberry, molasses, cocoa and cola flavors, accented with exotic dusty spices. For all the richness, it's totally dry, and the alcohol level is refreshingly low.",15.0,88,5,0.9590851375248586
50029,Newton 2005 Unfiltered Merlot (Napa Valley),"Bone dry and pretty tannic at the age of four-plus years, this Merlot has interesting flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce, but pliant. Should soften and mellow over the next 6–8 years.",60.0,89,5,0.9590849798376596
63136,TR Elliott 2009 Burgonet Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Right up there with the rich '08, Elliott's 2009 offers plenty of serious tasting pleasure. It's rich and ripe in raspberries and cherries, with complex notes of mushrooms, cola, herbs and spices. Dry and silky, it's a classy Pinot Noir for drinking over the next several years.",44.0,91,5,0.9590848486037512
110452,Longboard 2006 Sadie's Vineyard Carignan (Alexander Valley),"Not many people make a Carignan anymore, because the variety was condemned by critics as rustic. But this isn't a rustic wine. With sweetly ripened blackberry, mocha, toffee, black pepper and smoky new oak flavors wrapped into fine, classic tannins, it might almost be a young Syrah. Lovely now and for a couple years.",35.0,90,5,0.9590845950230206
23400,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Grand Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a good buy in a big, rich, decadently delicious Syrah. Soft and dry, with refined tannins, it offers flavors of currants, blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola, black pepper and spices. Easy to like, yet complex.",25.0,90,5,0.95908448934831
89306,Lapostolle 2006 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",25.0,89,5,0.9590844850754234
89288,Ridge 2009 York Creek Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A good, dry Zinfandel, although it's a little overripe in prunes. Not too much, though, so don't be alarmed. It's very spicy, suggesting drinking with equally spicy foods, like spice-rubbed beef, pork and chicken, grilled to perfection. Nice restaurant wine due to its elegance.",30.0,88,5,0.9590844542119205
112410,Chronicle 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A classy Pinot Noir that shows the attributes of its vintage and origin. The grapes come from the cooler, southern part of Russian River Valley, and the wine displays brisk acidity and complex flavors of cherries, pomegranates and cola. It's young now, but dry and elegant, and should develop bottle complexity through 2013.",35.0,90,5,0.9590843405765441
49013,Ideology Cellars 2007 Reserve Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So sweet and strong in jammy blackberry fruit, this young Cabernet is hardly drinkable now. The vineyard is in the Oak Knoll District, and the wine shows the big tannins and fine acidity of this cooler part of Napa Valley. An obvious cellar candidate, it needs 6–8 years of bottle age to begin to mellow.",68.0,93,5,0.959084234918326
76761,Frank Family 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This softly delicious, complex wine is one of the reasons why Pinot Noir has soared in popularity lately. Made from the Dijon clones that give such fruity wines in California, it's filled with raspberry, cherry and smoky cedar flavors, with the silky elegance you want from this variety. Drink this flashy wine soon, to fully appreciate the youthful fruit.",57.0,93,5,0.9590841893960788
47494,St. Clement 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a big, lush Cab, appealing now for its jammy blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But the tannins make for an unsettled astringency that needs rich meats to cut through. Fine now with complex beef dishes, but better after 2010.",36.0,88,5,0.9590840167399165
74958,Williamson Wines 2004 Amour Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich. It is, in black cherries, black currants, mocha and oak, but it remains a tough, hard wine despite being nearly six years old. Not going anywhere.",45.0,85,5,0.9590835987239195
61934,Justin 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is quite easily the best Justin Cabernet ever. The wine achieves a new height of richness of fruit, dazzling with waves of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and chocolate, liberally enhanced with sweet vanilla oak. Yet it's bone dry, and the tannins are immaculate, with enough acids for balance. Gorgeous now with haute cuisine.",45.0,93,5,0.9590835167206045
80131,Baileyana 2007 S-bar Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"This seems to be a bottling of some of the best blocks from the winery's Firepeak estate vineyard. Although it's modest in alcohol and quite acidic, it's richer and deeper than Baileyana's El Pico Pinot, with waves of cherries, cola, rhubarb and spice. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–5 years.",50.0,90,5,0.9590834634064989
28790,Groth 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"From the winery's estate vineyard, on the eastern side of the Oakville appellation, this Cab is incredibly lush and delicious. It dazzles with rich blackberry, cherry pie, currant and cassis liqueur flavors, perfectly accented by sweet, smoky oak. It's soft in tannins, yet ageworthy. Drink now–2020.",125.0,93,5,0.9590834411182227
52898,Rodney Strong 2009 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is the winery's top Cabernet. The '09 is very ripe, rich and forward, offering powerful blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's quite good, but it needs a couple of years in the bottle. Best around 2015.",75.0,92,5,0.9590833619973169
89181,Macauley 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's a very fine wine lurking inside this bottle, but right now, everything's disjointed. There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur. It's nowhere near ready, but there's no reason why this dramatic young wine shouldn't come together and improve over the years. Cellar it until 2017 and check up on it; this could be really something in 2025.",125.0,93,5,0.9590833495961872
3210,Freeman 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A lovely Pinot Noir that shows fine Russian River character. Made from some good vineyards, including Keefer Ranch, it shows an elegant deliciousness of cherry and raspberry jam, cola and pomegranate flavors, touched with new oak. Silky and dry, this polished wine is good to drink now, and will hold for 6–8 years.",44.0,92,5,0.9590832225865091
9642,Brogan 2006 Michaela's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",110.0,94,5,0.9590831970031856
69909,Laetitia 2009 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Laetitia's La Colline bottling is always a big, vital wine, unusually rich for Pinot Noir but nonetheless compelling. The 2009 vintage has been kind to it, resulting in fantastically concentrated flavors of cherry pie, pomegranate, persimmon, cola and mushroom, liberally enhanced by sweet new oak. It's a potent wine, one that Pinot purists might say is too extracted. But there's no denying its delicious beauty. Drink now–2015.",60.0,92,5,0.9590831133946944
47658,Grgich Hills 2008 Yountville Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While this Cabernet is very rich and ripe in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, crème de cassis and new oak, it's also very tannic. That bite of astringency gives it a rustic note. A very high, Port-like alcohol level may or may not thwart cellaring plans.",150.0,88,5,0.9590829923734414

3575,M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",195.0,90,5,0.959082875787611
8305,Megan Anne 2014 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Its prime location near Archery Summit and Domaine Drouhin marks Nysa as one of Oregon's most sought-after fruit sources. Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) has chosen it for one of two vineyard designates for this new project. Sweet baking spices and raspberry jam are the hallmarks here, offering immediate appeal, while retaining the structure to age for another decade. Aim for an optimal drinking window from 2019 through 2024.",55.0,91,5,0.9590828407525988
19514,Valance 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish. It's big and firm with a lot of promise, so do try to cellar it for at least six years, but people who like their wines young could try it sooner.",80.0,92,5,0.9590827302652418
66448,Mazzocco 2007 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.",40.0,86,5,0.9590824633431243
45993,Testarossa 2008 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.",54.0,94,5,0.9590824442296407
113102,Monticello Vineyards 2010 Estate Grown Syrah (Oak Knoll District),"It's pretty hard in mouth-numbing tannins. But it's also vastly rich in blackberries, dark chocolate, cassis liqueur, peppery spices, smoky oak, and a note of bacon, with all its umami attractions. Showing power but not much finesse now, it will hold through 2017. Beyond that, its future is risky.",38.0,88,5,0.959082388996368
114258,Bruliam 2010 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a great success in a challenging vintage. Dry and silky in the mouth, it's marked by brisk acidity, firm tannins and intricate black-cherry, cola and licorice flavors. It feels really interesting and changes with every sniff and sip. Very nice now, and it will develop over the next six years.",46.0,93,5,0.9590823732221035
98638,Adelaida 2004 HMR/Viking Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"There's a drily tannic texture that gives this very ripe Cab structure and balance. Thoroughly dry, it tastes of red and black currants, smoky oak and peppery, dusty Asian spices. Gets better and better as it unfolds in the glass.",50.0,89,5,0.959082264543883
53098,Frazier 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Ripe and heady in black currants, cassis liqueur, blackberry pie and mocha flavors, this Cab's high alcohol gives it a soft mellow mouthfeel, as well as some heat in the finish. With velvety tannins, it will pair well with a great steak.",55.0,89,5,0.9590822422998893
61740,Williams Selyem 2009 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit marks this impressive young Pinot Noir. It shows Williams Selyem's impeccable balance and elegance, but is a little soft and direct, lacking nuance. Could do interesting things in the bottle down the years, but seems best now and through 2014.",75.0,91,5,0.9590822189776481
35431,Edna Valley Vineyard 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Shows a degree of complexity that's rare in an Edna Valley Pinot, where fruit and acidity are easy, but layers of depth are hard. You'll find upfront cola, cherry, licorice, persimmon and smoky oak flavors, with deeper notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and sweet mulch. Should age well for six to eight years.",45.0,92,5,0.9590821265101397
73358,Charnu 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Classic Napa Cabernet, with perfectly ripened blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit, nicely elaborated by sweet, smoky oak, and framed in ripe, smooth tannins.

46190,Falcone 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This delicious wine shows Paso ripeness in the form of blackberry, cherry, anise and chocolate, with soft tannins and just enough acidity to balance the richness.

62204,Williams Selyem 2009 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Ferrington is one of Anderson Valley's best vineyards, and Williams Selyem has done an exceptional job with this impressive young '09. It's bone dry and fairly tannic, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors are balanced with earthy notes of cola, grilled mushrooms and dusty Indian spices. But it needs time. Better after 2015.",62.0,94,5,0.9590819694062926
115677,Mt. Brave 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"With raspingly dry, hard tannins, this is a difficult Cabernet to assess. It's impressively rich in blackberries and black currants, with a firm minerality, and the overall balance is good. Seems like it should develop over the next decade, maybe even longer, but those tannins might outlast the fruit.",75.0,93,5,0.9590819610919871
79081,Pali 2008 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"You'll find lovely, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, spices and smoky vanilla notes from oak in this dry, pleasant wine. It's also very tart, biting into the palate with a cut of acidity, which seems to be a trait of the vintage. Good now, if a little direct.",44.0,88,5,0.959081949619371
73109,Calera 2010 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"This is delicious now for its raspberry and cherry sweetness, accented with smoky oak and brightened by crisp acidity. It shows the elegance that Calera Pinots are known for. It's complex enough to offer lots of pleasure, but you may want to age it for 6–8 years to let it mellow.",48.0,92,5,0.9590819247352205
35392,Dashe Cellars 2009 Louvau Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dashe always produces dependably good Zinfandels from this vineyard. The 2009 shows real complexity, with an earthy, mushroomy richness alongside the raspberry, red currant and spice flavors. It's very dry, with a fine structure of acid and tannins. Marked by the rusticity that characterizes Dry Creek Zinfandels. It calls for pairing with rich stews, braised meats and barbecue.",32.0,88,5,0.9590818277688652
63538,Madrigal 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A polished, softly delicious Merlot, at a good price for the quality.

81507,Williams Selyem 2006 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Rich in fine, pure tannins, this Pinot is delicious now, but has the structure to age. It shows ripe wild black cherry, currant, mocha, anise and spice flavors that finish with a smoky, oaky sweetness. Best now for its approachability, and over the next few years.",72.0,93,5,0.9590817547333637
5900,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",55.0,93,5,0.959081500473863
50017,Blue Rock 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"It's tempting to dismiss this wine as simply another oaky fruit bomb, but that would be a mistake. Yes, it's enormously rich and ripe with flavors of blackberries and cherries, along with a caramelized opulence from oak barrels. But the acidity is perfect, and the tannins are pure and lovely. The result is an elegant, balanced Cabernet, that will age gracefully for many years.",45.0,91,5,0.9590814913576716
52110,Mount Eden Vineyards 2005 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Mount Eden makes their estate Cab the old-fashioned way: to age. The '05 is quite tannic and shut down right now, with a hard astringency, especially on the finish. However, it's rich in black currants, mocha and cedar, and is a natural for many years in the cellar. The score could rise considerably after 2011.",50.0,93,5,0.9590813532755516
5953,B.R. Cohn 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results.

94310,Robert Craig 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"This is a very lush Cab, made in the modern style. All the elements of cult Cab are there: the soft voluptuousness, the finely ground, sweet tannins, the immensely ripe currant, blackberry and cocoa flavors, the coating of fine, smoky oak. I don't think it's an ager because of the softness and ripeness.",70.0,92,5,0.9590809712537055
96547,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of pine, cola, wintergreen, anise, bacon and smoky, sweet vanillins from oak barrels. A wine of great pedigree, it's showing well now, and should hold for the next six years.",49.0,94,5,0.9590808563215908
106348,Salvestrin 2005 Salvestrin Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"A beautiful young Cab that continues Salvestrin's unbroken track record of the last several years.

79600,Von Strasser 2009 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.",80.0,95,5,0.9590807752393568
34462,Tudor Wines 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A very nice Pinot Noir.

It's rich in red and black currants, cassis and chocolate flavors and fully dry, with a fine minerality that adds to the structure. But the alcohol is on the high side, and it feels too soft for balance. Drink soon.",60.0,86,5,0.9590804924787107
32322,Paul Hobbs 2011 Katherine Lindsay Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This bottling by Hobbs typically is a compelling Pinot Noir, but with the 2011 vintage, they've exceeded even the outstanding 2010. The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years.",85.0,96,5,0.9590803621360181
9159,Merryvale 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A solid effort from this fine winery, from a vintage everyone is increasingly admitting was more difficult than it looked. It’s as middle of the road as you can get. It strikes all the right notes in terms of ripe, polished black-currant fruit, anise and smoky oak, yet never quite achieves complexity. Nonetheless there’s enough harmony and juiciness to satisfy.",25.0,87,5,0.9590802051257448
47263,Black Ridge 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Quite as good as the excellent '07, maybe even better, as it shows a little more structure behind the raspberry and cherry flavors. Tastes really good, a silky, spicy and dry wine that's a pleasure to drink. What a shame how little Pinot is actually grown in the Santa Cruz Mountains.",39.0,93,5,0.9590801340040037
99556,Parallel 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Delicious and compelling 100% Cabernet from this great vintage. Shows classically developed, sweet Napa tannins and wonderfully ripe fruit. As expressive as the blackberries and currants are, they're reined in with minerals and herbs to produce exquisite tension. Best now, with a good decant, and should develop for many years.",55.0,94,5,0.9590800768635421
74748,Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",45.0,96,5,0.959079919928955
25118,Obsidian Ridge 2007 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"A beautiful Cabernet that shows the promise of this Lake County appellation. Coming off the very good 2006, it shows the same dry balance, but is richer, offering graceful flavors of black currants, anise and herbs. It's quite a tannic wine that needs a rich steak to balance it.",28.0,90,5,0.9590798547514339
11838,Vermeil 2010 Pickett Road Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Defines the yummy-delicious modern style of Napa Cabernet, with wave after wave of sweet blackberry jam, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors. High alcohol gives it a sting of heat. Feels soft and mellow, like a melted candy bar. Drink soon.",125.0,89,5,0.959079837036753
78153,Cornerstone 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"Delicious, first class and possibly ageable. It's rich in blackberry pie filling, crême de cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a firm minerality that adds structural integrity. Sweet and ripe, but elegant. Will provide pleasant drinking over the next four years.",60.0,90,5,0.9590796371666809
38367,Francis Berwyn 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles),"A lovely Merlot and, at this price, a compelling buy. Hard to find a better inexpensive all-around full-bodied red than this one. Fully dry, it has polished flavors of cherries, currants, anise and pepper, wrapped in a gentle, silky texture.",13.0,87,5,0.9590793672041618
92402,Arrowood 2008 Reserve Speciale Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"One taste is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet. Made from Sonoma Valley and Knights Valley fruit, it's wonderfully sweet and deep in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with near-perfect tannins and a judicious touch of oak. Great for drinking now and over the next six years.",90.0,94,5,0.9590784206772489
42446,La Follette 2009 Van Der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Earns its high score by virtue of sheer power. Just explodes in the mouth with raspberry and cherry fruit, as well as spicy complexities of cola, red licorice and smoky oak. Dry and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, it's a little brawny now, but should develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",40.0,93,5,0.959078314281256
94701,Stephen Ross 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A stunningly delicious Pinot Noir, opulent in raspberry, cherry, red currant, red licorice, cola and beef jerky flavors. Impossible not to be impressed by the richness, yet the tannin-acid structure is wonderful and bracing. Doesn't seem likely to age well, so drink now.",38.0,93,5,0.959078157627718
84305,Kadiem 2009 Inaugural Vintage Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a really impressive launch for this new brand. Although the bottle doesn't bear a vineyard designation, it's 100% Cabernet from the Morisoli Vineyard in Rutherford, which has produced superb Cabernets in the past from the likes of Meander, Galleron, V. Sattui and Sequoia Grove. Dry and full bodied, it has flavors of sour cherry candy and cassis that often define Rutherford, which are all wrapped into smooth, supple tannins. Beautiful as it is now, it's a wine you want to lay down. Best after 2017.",85.0,95,5,0.9590776546148514
30855,Baldacci 2006 Brenda's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Easily earns its high score for the sheer power and mass, equal to anything out of Napa. Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive. Not for the faint-hearted, and not a wine to drink now, as it will swamp food. Should begin to emerge after 2012.",85.0,96,5,0.9590775129073618
26156,De Loach 2010 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Right out of the bottle, this single vineyard Pinot is rich. The flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, are delicious and direct. You can certainly drink it now, but the acid-tannin balance suggests the wine will develop and improve over the next 5–6 years.",50.0,90,5,0.9590762885620198
53323,Domaine Georg Rafael Vineyards 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"Young, tannic and acidic now, this is a gritty wine not offering lots of pleasure because of the toughness, despite some very rich blackberry, black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. You'll want to cellar it for four or five years. Its future beyond that is a question mark.",45.0,87,5,0.9590739905192901
50534,Corison 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth. But such is the depth of cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar and mineral flavors and overall balance that this complex young wine should easily negotiate the next 15 years.",70.0,92,5,0.9590734861387258
10308,Vermeil 2009 Jean Louis Vermeil Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Expensive, yes, but very fine, notable for a lovely structure and ripe, complex flavors that should develop in the cellar. It's dry, smoothly tannic and awesomely rich with blackberries and currants, and a gorgeous application of sweet new oak. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 10 years.",85.0,92,5,0.9571388207096301
70560,Failla 2006 Pearlessence Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Rigidity and acidity mark this young Pinot Noir. It's tart and a little tannic, but it has enormously rich flavors of cherries, currants, cola and pomegranates, enriched with smoky, spicy oak. Fine now with decanting and pairing with very rich fare, but should reward a few years in the cellar.",38.0,93,5,0.9571378626008658
62206,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar. Shows flashy cherry and raspberry fruit, with tantalizingly rich spices and a perfect coating of sweet, smoky oak. Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.",35.0,94,5,0.9571377723809178
37536,Lynmar 2009 Hawk Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Elegant in construction, with fine acidity and a sleek mouthfeel. What really stars are the flavors. Massive in raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and pomegranates, with lots of peppery spices and a smoky oak envelope. Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",70.0,93,5,0.9571375203859614
42442,Clos du Val 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Made in the classic Clos du Val style, this Cabernet is less ripe, drier and more acidic than many of its Napa Valley neighbors. It's also very tannic. Currently, it's an aloof, austere wine, but it has a deep core of blackberries. This wants at least eight years in a proper cellar, and should age well for another decade beyond that.",80.0,91,5,0.9571374847717893

79986,Hall 2007 Jack's Masterpiece Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.",70.0,93,5,0.9571373633197903
19827,Buena Vista 2007 Swan Selection Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Ripe and rich, but rather heavy and softly sweet, this wine lacks the vibrancy and elegance you want in a fine Pinot Noir, especially at this price. It's a decent everyday wine, with cola, rhubarb pie and cherry flavors.",42.0,84,5,0.9571373396800658
17744,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A stunningly good, young Cabernet, marked by rich, ripe flavors of blackberries, black currant and cedar flavors, wrapped into strong but fine tannins.

9251,Churchill Cellars 2008 Bella Luna Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Give this polished Pinot an hour or two of decanting and serve it now with a good steak, or try prosciutto-wrapped dates for an exotic appetizer.

113163,Rubicon Estate 2007 Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Gorgeous, elegant and ageworthy. With a softly tannic structure, it's drinkable now, but should age and gain complexity for 10 years. Dry and smooth, it has complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, red licorice, cola and oak. Give it some time to breathe. Now–2017.",75.0,95,5,0.9571367714922057
59704,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2006 Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While this isn't in the same league as the winery's stunning Alexander reserve-style bottling of Cabernet, it's an approximation of it and, at about one-third the price, a pretty good value. The wine is rich in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and balanced with gorgeous tannins, showing true Napa elegance. Drink now–2012.",42.0,92,5,0.9571366224998215
28675,Peju 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This rich Cabernet drinks beautifully now for its ripe, forward blackberry, cassis liqueur and oak flavors.

85161,Leaping Lizard 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A very nice Cabernet at a great price for the quality.

108569,Martin Ray 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Diamond Mountain, on the Mayacamas side of Napa Valley, has long been known for producing Cabs that possess hard tannins in their youth. Not this one. Modern tannin management has yielded a lush, lusciously soft wine, beguiling in blackberry and cherry pie filling and mocha flavors that are almost sweet. But the finish is thoroughly dry.",60.0,92,5,0.957136433682755
42276,Hawkes 2005 Red Winery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A very good wine, although a very young one that needs time. It's not because the tannins are hard, because they're not. But the primary blackberry and cherry flavors haven't married with the oak, despite the wine being more than three years of age. The grapes come from a tenderloin of the appellation that's known for quality. Best after 2009.",60.0,91,5,0.9571363923756951
24488,Goyette 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of power and richness in this young, vigorous Pinot Noir.

Exotic and interesting, it should develop over the next 3–4 years.",24.0,90,5,0.9571362538896354
17405,Mazzocco 2007 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Super-fruity, offering a blast of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, persimmons, red plums and bacon, finished with enormous spices. The wine is technically dry but tastes sweet with high-alcohol glycerine and smoky oak. Drink this strong, uni-dimensional Zinfandel now.",29.0,85,5,0.9571360315031519
35437,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 47 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"This wine has the solid tannins the mountain is known for, and ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and chocolate, enriched with new oak. At twenty bucks, and with a low production, it's a stunning value. With real elegance and even ageworthiness, it's one of the best at its price point available now.",20.0,91,5,0.957135964572862
10290,Bennett Lane 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Right out of the bottle, this is one tough Cabernet. It's very tannic and extracted with blackberry jam, and the oak stands off to one side—sweet and smoky and flashy. However, that “Wow!” factor is always there, and the overall balance suggests cellaring. Already throwing some thick sediment, it should begin to mellow after 2018.",95.0,92,5,0.9571358516629207
83857,Pride Mountain 2006 Vintner Select Cuvée Merlot (Sonoma County),"There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.",75.0,94,5,0.9571358087472416
116358,Sebastiani 2009 Barbera (Sonoma Valley),"This is a big, lusty, fruit-forward wine. It shows Barbera's tannins, although they're soft and just need a steak to balance them out. The flavors are of rich, ripe blackberries and cherries. It's pretty much as elegant as Barbera gets, considering it is usually rather rustic in California.",26.0,89,5,0.9571357905504925
32111,Roessler 2009 Hein Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A lovely Pinot Noir, delicious and sweet in fruit. You'll find a glyceriney fatness to it, courtesy of high alcohol, as well as sweet, smoky oak. The underlying flavors are wonderfully ripe in raspberries and cherries, and are brightened with fine acidity.",46.0,93,5,0.9571357017247754
15444,Sebastiani 2009 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"The winery has been producing this bottling for many years, and this is possibly the finest ever. It's soft, but not too soft, ripe, but not too ripe, and exquisitely flavorful, offering tiers of red cherries, cocoa and bacon, enhanced with smoky, sweet new oak. It's a fine wine to drink with grilled steak.",90.0,94,5,0.957135632406546
23793,Goldschmidt 2006 Vyborny Vineyard Plus Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6–8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",150.0,93,5,0.9571355229140169

49659,Lost Canyon 2006 Dutton Ranch Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.",42.0,92,5,0.957135415806431
43172,Beaver Creek 2007 Horne Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),"Good blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors in this Cab, and it's nicely dry, with firm, finely ground tannins. Turns rather sharp on the finish, and that tartness may never go away.",39.0,85,5,0.9571353000002566
40415,Roessler 2008 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows lots of classy elegance, with brisk acidity and firm minerals and some finely ground tannins that frame the wild cherry, cola and oak flavors.

28557,Merryvale 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Another great success from Merryvale. Somehow they manage to make red wines that are ripe, oaky and opulent, yet maintain balance so that you can drink it over the course of a meal without the flavors palling. Dry and tannicly sophisticated, it shows complex waves of blackberries, cassis, cherries and sweet, smoky cedar.",65.0,93,5,0.9571351929745628
56198,De Paola Vineyard 2008 Emilio Zinfandel (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The alcohol on this Zin is enormous, giving it a Port-style headiness.

80948,Lynmar 2005 Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is just too young to drink now. The interplay of the acids and tannins locks down the flavors and make a sting on the palate. But there is the terrific core of flavor, of ripe blackberries and cherries, of red and black currants, of cola and root beer and licorice, that will emerge in time, making for delicious drinking. Best 2009–2013, possibly longer.",60.0,93,5,0.9571349109384657

90568,Failla 2008 Occidental Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A strong, powerful Pinot that's nowhere ready to drink. That's despite massive blackberry, cherry, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors that dazzle the palate. The tannins are potent, the acidity is tart and the finish is bone dry. Obviously needs time in the bottle. Try after 2013.",60.0,92,5,0.95713490227265
107087,Sebastiani 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Sebastiani has had good results with their Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, and this bottling continues that tradition.

96548,Wallis Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Rich, elaborate and layered. If this Cab were a fabric, it would be suede.

Should develop for at least eight years.",65.0,94,5,0.957134754564142
13049,Corison 2005 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least.",98.0,94,5,0.9571347433232704

22163,Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Beaulieu does what it's done so well for so long, producing a Cabernet that reflects real Napa character, at a good price.

16714,Chanin 2007 Le Bon Climat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.",45.0,92,5,0.9571343200922541
20279,Tetra 2008 Red (Napa Valley),"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb.

68031,Surh Luchtel 2005 Sacrashe Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This vineyard has never produced anything less than great Cabernet, and Surh Luchtel, who buys grapes from it, has a great track record. As always, the '05 is stunningly rich and refined. It shows powerful flavors of cassis and minerals, which come from the grapes, and the most tasteful overlay of toasty oak. Fine now, and should hold for a decade.",60.0,94,5,0.957134168091536
23414,St. Supéry 2005 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure.

27847,Armanino Family Cellars 2011 The Ringneck Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A distinguished Pinot Noir that shows its coastal origins in brisk tannins and citrusy acidity. Beneath the astringency and tartness are impressive cherry, currant, cola, sweet tobacco and sandalwood flavors that finish with great complexity and style. Certainly seems like a wine for the cellar. Your window of drinkability is 2015–2019.",55.0,92,5,0.9571340617209974
19292,Château Potelle 2004 VGS Syrah (Mount Veeder),"This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it. Best now (if you like young tannic wines, but please decant) and for at least eight years, as it gradually mellows.",75.0,93,5,0.9571340592426713
4521,Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",230.0,94,5,0.9571339084597456

42856,Napa Angel 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Thick in tannins, and with a sweet, tart taste of blackberry jam, this Cabernet isn't offering much subtlety now. It feels tough and gritty, a wine with plenty of youthful, primary fruit. Could develop in the bottle. Give it a good decant if you drink now. Tasted twice.",55.0,88,5,0.9571335952155112
53436,Sinor-LaVallee 2008 Talley-Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The pedigree of the vineyard shows in this beautiful wine, easily the best of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs. It's rich and complex in cherry and currant fruit, with a sautéed mushroom earthiness and the smoke of oak. With exquisite acid-tannin balance, it's beautiful to drink now and for the next six years or so.",40.0,93,5,0.9571335881187711
25567,Merry Edwards 2008 Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",54.0,96,5,0.9571335827464197
64072,Thomas Fogarty 2011 Rapley Trail Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a full-flavored Pinot Noir, brimming with cherry, cola, red licorice and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and spices. It's quite low in alcohol, which preserves the airy, silky texture you want in a nice Pinot. It's also a young wine. Give it six years in the cellar.",65.0,90,5,0.957133384392265
111222,Obsidian Ridge 2009 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding. The tannins are pronounced, giving it a hard bite. But it's rich and deep in crème de cassis, the sort of wine that seems ageworthy. Take a gamble and put it in your cellar for 6–8 years.",28.0,90,5,0.9571332431945883
99786,Sebastiani 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Here's a solid Cabernet with extra features of complexity and interest.

99977,Armanino Family Cellars 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Marked by acidity, strong tannins and powerful fruit, this Cabernet is a three-way playoff. The fruit is the obvious early victor, flashy in plums, blackberries, cassis and cedar. But the astringency makes it difficult to enjoy now. Cellar for six years, and see what happens.",95.0,89,5,0.957133058052816

69699,Siduri 2012 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Winemakers fight to get fruit from this coveted vineyard, which famously produces ageworthy Pinots. Siduri's 2012 vintage is surprisingly versatile with lovely raspberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, accented with sweet oak. The balance is impeccable, with fine acidity and soft, refined tannins.

79608,Sanford 2010 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a fancy restaurant-style Pinot Noir. That means it's dry, silky and rich, and has that elusive, undefinable quality of elegance that can accompany the finest Pinot-friendly foods, such as steak, lamb, grilled tuna or a wild mushroom risotto.

95751,De Loach 2009 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones.

114149,Hartford Court 2011 Jennifer's Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Grown in the cooler Sebastopol Hills part of the southern valley, this Pinot is a great success for the vintage.

19976,Olabisi 2009 Gratitude Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"At the age of four-plus years, this 100% Cabernet is not showing well. It's very tannic and dry, with mouthwatering acidity and a brittle mouthfeel. The flavors are elusive, suggesting black currants, oak and minerals, although it certainly is elegantly structured.

You can stand it against anything in California and it will acquit itself with pride.

45932,Ojai 2007 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Too young now, a tight wine whose oak, acidity, alcohol and fruit are all over the place. The cherry, currant, cola, beef jerky and Asian spice flavors are quite intricate and delicious. There's a dry, elegant wine in here that's just waiting to bust out and come together after 4–5 years in a good cellar.",45.0,90,5,0.957130139308112

43408,Robert Young 2005 Scion Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",58.0,93,5,0.9571300610422682
41192,Joseph Phelps 2008 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),"A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now. Give it a rest until 2015.",200.0,93,5,0.9571299066954769
90833,Work 2004 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in an exotic style, this Zin is ultra-concentrated in fruit and rich in tannins, in the way of a Howell Mountain red wine.

74656,D.R. Stephens 2008 Moose Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang.

90576,Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot 246 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A great Cabernet for drinking now with upscale dishes. Production was 2,700 cases, but it's worth a search.

But by a hair, this is the best and most compelling, delicious in blackberries, blueberries and cherries. It's hard not to drink the entire bottle now, with its tantalizing acidity and soft but intricate tannins. And yet this gorgeous wine will develop bottle complexity until 2020 or 2021.

31563,Corley 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency.

55969,Tin House 2005 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Tin House has been producing good Pinot Noirs that have been pushing the possibilities for Edna Valley, although the prices are going up every year.

27889,Provenance Vineyards 2007 Beckstoffer Tokalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From the famed vineyard in Oakville comes this dramatic wine. It will benefit from a few years in the cellar to let the tannins mellow, although it's so good now, you can open it right away and give it a decant. Drinks sweet and lush in blackberries and black currants, with a rich overlay of smoky cedar.",85.0,93,5,0.9549926058976148
37503,Coniglio 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.",60.0,91,5,0.954992601615541

92395,Au Sommet 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Very rich and opulent, in the Heidi Barrett style, this Cabernet is sweetly jammy but somewhat direct in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The finish is extraordinarily long and spicy, an indication that it's a wine for the cellar. Firm tannins and fine acidity confirm its ageability. Hold this flashy, decadent wine until 2016 and then try it again.",250.0,94,5,0.9549925448253803
47797,Stolpman 2007 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Not showing well now due to tough, gritty tannins and unintegrated fruit and oak flavors that taste jammy sweet in raspberries, cherries and mocha, like a little fruit pastry.

23798,Clos du Val 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring.

20855,Waits-Mast 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot.

52918,Etude 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it hard to appreciate now, but it will soften with some time in the cellar. Dry, silky and tannic, it features an enormous black-cherry flavor, with considerable oak overtones. It is an altogether impressive wine.

43717,Standish 2005 Mayflower Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is the smoothest, most polished of Standish's quartet of new Pinots. It's a best-of-barrels selection, and really impressive in cherry, currant, licorice, cola and Provençal herbs. With near-perfect balance, it exemplifies Anderson Valley and also is a standout in the great 2005 vintage.

66282,Etude 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Rich, ripe blackberry, cherry, mocha, anise and cedar flavors mark this 100% Cabernet.

93948,Keenan 2005 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity.

97834,Laird 2009 Flat Rock Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",80.0,95,5,0.95499173406685

115669,Pride Mountain 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma),"Abundantly rich in fruit, this Cabernet shows its California origins in the incredibly ripe blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. It's sweet, almost like pie filling, except the finish is thoroughly dry. Thick mountain tannins make for astringency, suggesting ageworthiness.

75268,Carr 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This has been one of Carr's more successful bottlings, and the '08 is quite a good wine, although not quite up there with the '05. It's very deep in flavor, with lush, impressive notes of cherry pie filling with the smoky-sweet crust and masses of savory Indian spices. The acidity is quite high, maybe a little too much so.",40.0,90,5,0.9549916088304394
1292,Rocca 2010 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup.

It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.",85.0,92,5,0.9549914499703946
73835,Sojourn 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"From a winery whose Cabernets have struggled over the years comes this release from Napa's Howell Mountain.

17629,Tres Sabores 2004 Perspective Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A very distinctive 100% Cab that some might even find controversial. It's ripe almost to the point of supermaturity, showing powerful currant and licorice flavors that are very well oaked. Finishes hard in tannins in its youth.

40235,Adobe Road 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A good wine for its classic structure and deep, complex black currant and cocoa flavors.

4491,Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices.

It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue.

35252,Clendenen Family 2007 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Ultrarich and spicy, with exotic flavors of bacon, cherry pie, cola and sandalwood. Notable for its structure, so dry and sturdy in tannins, yet so silky. A big, full-bodied wine, it should develop bottle complexity over the next four years.",60.0,93,5,0.9549885940926636
47662,Ravenswood 2009 Big River Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"With flavors of wild blackberry and cherry, pepper, cinnamon, currant and heady cassis, this is a classic example of warm-climate Zin.

14067,Pech Merle 2010 Cuccio Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This showcases the varietal's rustic side, with edgy tannins and a briary mouthfeel framing cherry, raspberry, spice and tobacco flavors. It's dry and very high in alcohol, which gives it a glycerine-based sweetness. This does a good job expressing the essential Dry Creek Zinfandel character.",27.0,88,5,0.9549882861740826
68025,Piña 2005 Buckeye Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Howell Mountain has been the source of Piña's best Cabs, and this single-vineyard bottling shows stunning concentration and complexity. It's closed and tannic now, in the manner of Howell Mountain Cabs, but enormous in ripe black currant fruit, with the power and focus to age for many years. Best after 2009 and through 2017, but only with impeccable cellar conditions.",78.0,95,5,0.9549882759593858
78865,Compass 1998 Merlot (California),"Starts out with Cabernet-like aromas of black currants and an undercurrent of something leaner: unsweetened chocolate, anise, and smoky, oaky notes.  This wine accomplishes what many inexpensive Merlots don't: a rich, fruity smoothness.  Which makes it a good Merlot value, even though the score isn't very high.",10.0,84,5,0.9549881021791101
79854,Vice Versa 2005 Vice Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Made from Beckstoffer's portion of To Kalon, this is exceptionally rich and decadent. Cabs don't get much riper. Blasts off with black currants, cassis, chocolate fudge and exotic spices. But the wine is soft and the alcohol is quite high, making it almost sweet. Would benefit from being drier and more structured.",150.0,89,5,0.9549879461188102
80718,Truchard 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),"The vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros, and the wine shows ripe flavors of blackberry and black currant, with sweet vanilla and toast from new oak barrels.

17422,Jeff Gordon 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich blackberry purée, blueberry jam, raspberry pie, cherry tart and cedar flavors in this Cab. Rather direct in its appeal, and a bit too sweet, but its solid New World style will appeal to some.",69.0,87,5,0.9549875624970998
112425,A Donkey and Goat 2007 Perli Vineyards Syrah (Mendocino Ridge),"This is a wine that wants a little time in the cellar. It has very rich, ripe, concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors, accented with bacon, smoky oak and black pepper. But it's tannic and the fruit is jammy. The parts simply haven't knit together. Give it 2–3 years.",35.0,89,5,0.954987539309251
16125,Cinnabar 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Good for Cinnabar for holding this Cab back a while, to let it develop in the bottle.

Dry and full-bodied, it shows classic flavors of black currants and smoky cedar, with a long, impressive finish.",45.0,92,5,0.9549872091329711
90821,Smith & Hook 2005 Grand Reserve Red (Central Coast),"Smith & Hook has tried hard to perfect their Cab, transferring fruit sourcing from Monterey to Paso Robles.

77853,Dry Creek Vineyard 1998 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Defines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins.",35.0,88,5,0.9549862722360901
91012,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer.

Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",44.0,92,5,0.9549861911012179
76529,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),"Super-fruity, offering a burst of chocolate-inspired cherries, raspberries and sweet, smoky vanilla and cedar.

60349,Perbacco Cellars 2007 Dionysus Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is the winery's low production barrel selection reserve.

113093,Buena Vista 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a good price for a Pinot of this quality. On the plus side, it's dry, tannic and silky, with pomegranate, cola and cherry skin flavors, as well as complexing notes of portobello mushrooms and sandalwood. It's a little rustic and won't age, and shows best if decanted before drinking.",25.0,88,5,0.95498000768505
81520,La Fenêtre 2007 Calmant Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit.

61355,Decoy 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hard to explain why this Cabernet is so good at such an affordable price, but there you are.

25564,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir.

80953,Robert Mondavi 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",125.0,92,5,0.95262608181828
4468,Joseph Phelps 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine shows the glamour you expect from a Phelps Cabernet.

15590,Geyser Peak 2004 Reserve Alexandre Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),"Reserve Alexandre is always a really nice, interesting wine, but with recent price increases, consumers should be wary. The '04 shows classic Alexander Valley softness and herbs, along with cherries, blackberries and oak, and it's an elegantly balanced wine.

19246,Hidden Ridge 2006 55% Slope Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy. For some reason, the winery lowered the price considerably from the 2005, which was a much better wine.",40.0,87,5,0.9526258001950076
114386,Piña 2007 Buckeye Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Piña has a spectacular record with this wine, and indeed with all their Cabs from Howell Mountain. The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs.

47767,Deovlet 2008 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very big and rich and extracted, offering massive flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with caramelized oak. Very delicious, if a little obvious. Pinot Noirs from this stretch of the southern Santa Rita Hills tend to age well, gaining earthy complexities over the years. This one could hang in there for a long time.",45.0,90,5,0.9526250595728689
37937,L de Lyeth 2011 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Really impressive at this price for its depth of flavor and overall balance.

44058,Laurel Glen 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"Hard tannins, dryness and oakiness are the three horsemen that mark this young, vital Cabernet. Is it ageworthy? Absolutely. Once the fruit kicks in, which is pretty much instantly, it's devastatingly rich and spicy in blackberries, blueberries and cassis. Clearly a cellar candidate for at least the next decade.",60.0,92,5,0.9526248995394936

80945,Arrowood 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Shows the impeccable balance you expect from this master winemaker, even in this hot vintage, where supermaturity was a challenge. The wine is certainly ripe, offering a mouthful of blackberries, cherries and currants. But it never loses its elegant tannin-acid architecture. Beautiful now, and should develop through 2014.",50.0,93,5,0.9526248573983203
33071,Aiken 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Atypical of a Rutherford Cabernet, this is in fact unlike most of today's expensive Cabernets from anywhere in Napa Valley. It's aggressively tannic and dry, and it seems emulate an older style, though the alcohol is considerably higher than anything from the old days. With a core of blackberries and black currants, it may well develop bottle complexity over the years.",125.0,92,5,0.9526248168713224
45737,Kasuari 2005 Rose Knoll Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This Zin is a little on the soft side, but it's very good, even charming in the way it flatters the palate with richness.

64064,Piña 2010 Wolff Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"The chilly vintage has given this wine a toughness of tannins and acids that makes it difficult to appreciate now.

70425,Hidden Ridge 2009 55% Slope Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This wine tests the critic's judgment. Is it just a fruit bomb, bursting with cherries, raspberries and blackberries, enhanced with caramelized oak? Or is it a Cab that needs time? All indications suggest the latter. The tannins are thick and hard, courtesy of the vineyard's high altitude in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the acidity is perfect to protect the wine as it evolves in the bottle.

15122,Juslyn Vineyards 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"There's something rustic about this Cab. Partly it's the tannins, which are fierce. Partly it's the alcohol, which sticks out and gives the wine a burn. Yet it's extraordinarily ripe and opulent in black currants, with the liqueur headiness of crème de cassis. The hot alcohol suggests it will not age.",125.0,86,5,0.9526232408741384
22294,Testarossa 2007 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011.",56.0,93,5,0.9526231884692992
82829,Thomas Fogarty 2010 Rapley Trail Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Easy to like now for its silky texture, brisk acidity and upfront raspberry and cherry jam flavors. It's textbook Pinot Noir, offering the lightness in the mouth you expect from this variety, yet packing plenty of power. Give it an hour or two in the decanter, and it should be lovely with beef, lamb or tuna.",55.0,90,5,0.9526231806239047
86400,Jax 2005 Y3 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Marked by jammy fruit and high acidity, this Syrah is strong in cherries, raspberries and oak. It's not especially subtle, but it is pretty and polished, and could even acquire bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",29.0,86,5,0.9526231694639182
2914,Peju 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This wine is a little direct, but very tasty, showing rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into lovely tannins. A polished, pretty wine for drinking now.",35.0,88,5,0.9526231114072704
34497,St. Francis 2007 Anthem Meritage (Sonoma Valley),"Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.",60.0,88,5,0.9526229763938328
33654,Goldeneye 2005 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Winemaker Zach Rasmuson did not produce a Narrows Vineyard bottling in 2005. Instead, those grapes went into the regular Goldeneye, to its great benefit. The wine is particularly rich and powerful in cherry pie filling, black raspberry, mocha, Dr. Pepper and smoky oak flavors, with a gorgeous, mouth-filling texture that's dramatic on the finish.",55.0,92,5,0.9526229325417953
37399,Failla 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Failla has been working with the fruit from this coveted vineyard for a long time, and has figured it out better than anyone. How they take basic Russian River Valley cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and uplift the wine into the extraordinarily exotic is inexplicable. But they do. An amazingly complex, compelling young Pinot Noir. Drink now–2019, at least.",45.0,95,5,0.9526227773037178
60403,Geyser Peak 2007 Block Collection Walking Tree Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Shows strong, extracted blackberry and black cherry flavors, with a pie-filling spicy intensity. Almost too much of a good thing. Might improve a little in the bottle with a year or two.",25.0,86,5,0.9526227456442226
101412,Sandhi 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Made in a leaner style, with modest in alcohol, this swaps power for elegance. It's streamlined, brisk and bone dry, with complex flavors of sour cherry candy, cola, dusty spice and sandalwood. With decanting this can be enjoyed now, but try cellaring it for 5–6 years and see how it evolves in the bottle.",45.0,91,5,0.9526227440923091
7991,Chateau St. Jean 2004 Cinq Cepages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins. Not a long-term ager, but should hold for 6 years, and is easy to find, with more than 13,000 cases produced.",75.0,92,5,0.952622743939911
85342,Round Pond 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Extremely rich, soft and fruity, like blackberry pie drizzled with melted chocolate. The tannins are lush, complex and gentle. Made in the modern way, it's certainly delicious, but almost too much of a good thing.",50.0,88,5,0.9526226974641085
7125,Tandem 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.",48.0,88,5,0.9526226776191195
45935,Corley 2007 Yewell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Right now this is a big, tough Cabernet. It's very dry and oaky, and the black and red cherry flavors have a jammy edge. Despite the apparent simplicity, you find yourself returning to it, a good sign that suggests complex ageability. Give it 4–6 years in a cool cellar.",65.0,90,5,0.9526226181561965
61376,Martin Ray 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A thick coating of tannins makes this Cabernet hard in the mouth, but even so, the blackberry, blueberry, currant and sweet oak flavors poke through to the surface. It's a fine young wine that needs two or three years to knit together.",40.0,90,5,0.9526225850687616
46686,Forefathers 2006 Lone Tree Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Strong in primary fruit now. Overwhelms with the ripest blackberries, cherries and red currants, with lots of toasty oak, and a hint of herbs. The tannins are dusty and soft. Fine if you like your Cabs young, but should benefit from 3–5 years in the cellar.",50.0,90,5,0.9526224097260364
44821,J. Rickards 2008 Five Sisters Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions. It has herb and tobacco flavors, but there's also a delicious sunburst of sweetly ripe cherries right in the middle that lasts through the finish. Should develop over the next 7–8 years.",34.0,89,5,0.9526223670019737
76243,Penché 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made in the modern cult style, this Cab is soft, voluptuously oaky and extracted in perfectly ripe blackberries and currants, with spicy, oaky notes. It's refined and classically Napa and impressive, although it's not that much different from other Cabs of its pedigree.",75.0,92,5,0.9526223503057852
47649,Bernardus 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"So ripe and decadent, it is perhaps the wine equivalent of a candy bar, with raspberry, cherry, red currant, vanilla and cinnamon flavors. Pinot doesn't get any tastier than this, but it does get more complex. Still, this is fancy enough to drink over the next six years with steak, duck, tuna or lamb.",60.0,88,5,0.9526222440455964
33838,Shafer 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Continues the Shafer tradition of richly fruity Cabs, with near-perfect tannins and just-right oak, and an elegant suppleness that's delicious and distinctive in youth, but ageworthy. The fine vintage has made the wine extra-complex and balanced. Over the years, many wineries have arisen, but few have a better track record than Shafer.",48.0,93,5,0.9526221033196802
69018,Merryvale 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is rich with tannins and a little heavy on the palate with massive, concentrated flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and mocha. Delicious in that classic Napa way, if lacking a bit of finesse. Seems best now and over the next six years.",70.0,88,5,0.9526220197292422
101418,Dry Creek Vineyard 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful—softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory.",25.0,91,5,0.9526219525214868
104924,Merry Edwards 2011 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years.",60.0,96,5,0.9526219466042518
2777,Flora Springs 2008 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years.",100.0,95,5,0.9526219109618864
27323,Novy 2011 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Hard tannins, dryness and brisk acidity can't hide the enormous core of blackberries and currants. It was clearly grown in a cool climate. The wine doesn't seem likely to develop, so drink soon, with barbecue to cut through the tannins.",32.0,88,5,0.9526218758208167
29403,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2005 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, with explosive blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, gingerbread, cola and smoky oak flavors. The structure is very fine, with rich, ripely smooth tannins and good acidity. Delicious now, and should remain so for several years.",80.0,92,5,0.95262177431842
30346,Wine Spots 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",25.0,88,5,0.9526216875707755

89963,Rodney Strong 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in an immediately appealing style, this Pinot is soft and lush and vast in fruit and oak richness. It floods the palate with cherry and raspberry pie filling, vanilla, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors, and the texture is silky and elegant.",40.0,91,5,0.9526216747113191
82640,Whitehall Lane 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So broadly delicious now, it hardly seems worthwhile to age this wine, but don't let it fool you. The blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, minerals and oak will only transform into something seamlessly complex with 8–10 years in the cellar. The winery's Reserve bottling has established itself as one of the most consistently fine, ageable Cabs in Napa Valley.",75.0,93,5,0.9526215772527098
19532,Raymond 2007 Generations Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10–12 years.",85.0,92,5,0.9526214941478777
114464,Heron 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Blended from Mendocino, Clarksburg (Delta) and Pope Valley fruit, this easy-drinking Cab is very ripe in blackberries and cherries, but also shows a good structure of tannins and acids. The alcohol is refreshingly low. A good price for a wine so satisfying.",14.0,87,5,0.9526213274348535
15614,Sextant 2009 Wheelhouse Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A little high in alcohol, as is the Paso Robles way, but really a very lush and pleasurable Zinfandel. Softly tannic and slightly sweet, it floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries, black cherries, mocha, cinnamon and pepper.",21.0,88,5,0.9526212943229619
49014,Andrew Murray 2009 Watch Hill Vineyard Syrah (Central Coast),"If more Syrah tasted like this, the variety just might overtake Cabernet in popularity. It's really good, combining a dry, firm structure with lush flavors, in the way of blackberries, blueberries, currants and a meatiness like the sweet, charred fat on a steak. Kudos to vintner Murray for bottling it in a screwtop.",36.0,93,5,0.9526212239531553
86898,Calix 2005 Masked Man Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Shows fine pedigree in the ripeness and finesse of the tannins, which are as pure as velvet. Flavorwise, this Syrah is very ripe, bursting in blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and mocha flavors that are almost sweet on the finish. It's made in the modern Napa style, and not an ager.",35.0,87,5,0.9526211871609526
21516,Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vintage was kind to this bottling, resulting in fabulously ripe flavors of cherry, black raspberry and cola that finish in a swirl of exotic spices. It's a bit heavy and direct in primary fruit, but the acids and tannins are fine, and should allow this wine to age for the next 6–8 years.",70.0,92,5,0.9526211767891497
7600,Titus 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Pretty much a near replica of the winery's previous vintage, a sound, clean and dry Cabernet for drinking soon. It's rich in tannins, with varietally proper flavors of blackberries, black currants, plums and cedar. Give it a good decant before pouring.",40.0,88,5,0.9526210978505057
45468,Lost Canyon 2007 Widdoes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power.

Only 126 cases produced.",42.0,95,5,0.952621074557846
87630,Mercy 2008 Zabala Vineyard Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"The grapes didn't get quite ripe during this cool vintage in the cool Arroyo Seco. As a result, this Syrah is dry and acidic, yet curiously high in alcohol, with a vegetal and mint edge to the blackberry fruit.",28.0,83,5,0.9526209696864978
55674,V. Sattui 2009 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The winery used to make an indifferent Pinot Noir from Carneros, but now they have some good fruit, and the improvement shows. The wine is delightful, with crisp acidity brightening very ripe flavors of raspberries, cola and black cherries, with lots of smoky oak. Drink this complex wine now and for the next few years. .",40.0,90,5,0.9526206852052992
17569,Calera 2009 de Villiers Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Shows much in common with past vintages of this bottling. It's dry, tart in acidity and somewhat earthy, with a nice balance of cherries, herbs and cedar. Feels complex and distinguished, in a dry, elegant style.",35.0,90,5,0.9526206802665721
63117,Vine Cliff 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A gorgeous Cabernet, rich and flamboyant, the kind of wine that knocks you out at first sip. It's soft but complex in tannins, and dry, with luxurious blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors brightened by fine acidity. Hard to say where it's going, but so delicious, it's a wine to drink now.",75.0,92,5,0.9526206564534616
113413,Mahoney 2007 Mahoney Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Terrific Pinot Noir—balanced, dry and complex, showing exuberantly delicious fruit. The flavors of cherries, raspberries and mulberries are complexed with minerals and herbs, and the wine feels clean and silky.

94711,Arrowood 2007 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak. Fascinating and intricate and a little heady, but undrinkable now due to immaturity. Needs 5–6 years to show its stuff.",70.0,92,5,0.9526205469655925
50069,Baron Herzog 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Lots of pure Cabernet flavor in this pleasant wine. It's rich in black cherry tart, currant, licorice and spice flavors, with a sweet coating of smoky oak. Good price for the quality.",13.0,87,5,0.9526205048836777
90767,Cerro Prieto 2008 Paso Bordo Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This ripe, rich wine can't quite get around its alcohol level, which is 15.8%. That gives it some heat, as well as a sweetness that makes the blackberries, cherries and raspberries taste like jam. Earns points for the clean, unapologetic interpretation of Paso Robles fruit.",37.0,87,5,0.9526204472049828
20033,Jorian Hill 2009 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A dry, rich 100% Syrah, this showcases the classic Santa Ynez structure of firm tannins and crisp acids, and it offers deep flavors of blackberry, cassis and bacon. This 2009 is Jorian Hill's best effort yet, and it's already delicious to drink.",24.0,89,5,0.952620338428945
39603,Merry Edwards 2007 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",54.0,92,5,0.9526202370257421
108154,Shafer 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley),"The flavors in this Merlot are exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants, red plums, mocha and new oak, and the tannins are rich and refined. High alcohol gives it a heat that makes it uncomfortable.",50.0,87,5,0.9526199655636357
13528,Side Job 2006 Stefani Vineyard C5 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"They should put this in a time capsule as a classic example of early 20th century California Zinfandel.

16696,Modus Operandi 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, sweetly oaked wine notable for its ripe flavors and sheer opulence. It's distinctly Californian in the massive, rather jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries, and shows good balance in the richness of tannins and savory acidity. Delicious as it is, it's all primary fruit now. Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",65.0,92,5,0.952619879053774
99801,Frick 2006 Conley Vineyard Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Cherries of every kind—red, black, jam, pie—are the essence of flavor here, along with red licorice, cola and sandalwood.

47893,Geyser Peak 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Alexander Valley has a rep for soft, forward Cabs of great deliciousness but, perhaps, a lack of complexity. That description fits this dark, young wine, except for one thing: It’s complex. You’ll find all the spicy-curranty depths of flavor you want, and plenty of oak, and it will even age, because the tannins, while soft, are intricate.",40.0,91,5,0.9526198096848661
2915,Pope Valley Winery 2010 Eakle Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This dry, tannic wine is astringent now, in the way of a young Cabernet. It has a heart of ripe blackberries and currants, and finishes dry and clean. There's a rustic edge that  suggests drinking over the next 2–3 years.",28.0,88,5,0.9526196709689262
107433,Foxen 2011 Williamson-Doré Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"What a pretty Syrah this is. With moderate alcohol and subtle oak influences, it's dry and stylishly elegant in the mouth.

102164,Vellum 2012 Black Petit Verdot (Suisun Valley),"A very dry and firmly tannic wine, this doesn't give up much aroma, and the flavors also seem bound up with the astringent texture. With a bit of time some blueberry and blackberry aromas emerge, and flavors of black olive, too. This wine seems to require the most marbled steak to balance its austerity in texture, or perhaps 10 years in a cool cellar.",75.0,85,5,0.952619150283677
19738,Twomey 2010 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"All of the parts haven't yet come together: The oak, acidity, fruit and tannins hover around, but they're not quite completely harmonious yet.

91391,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Jemrose Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Fruity enough, with powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, currant, chocolate and licorice flavors that go on and on through the long, spicy finish.

99508,Stephen Ross 2010 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"So crisply delicious now, it's the perfect wine to drink with steak, lamb or any Pinot-friendly foods.

89568,Three Sticks 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Acidity marks this wine, giving it a cut that streaks right down the middle of the blackberry, black cherry and cedar flavors. It's very dry, with rich, refined tannins, and that acidity will come in handy paired against a steak.",65.0,88,5,0.952617979531892

101784,Venge 2005 Estate Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"Feels plush and important as soon as you taste it, not only for the ripe cherry, red currant, cola and spice flavors, but for the structure, which is dry and elegant. However, it's a very young wine, not ready to drink, although that won't stop many people from popping the cork now. Give it through the summer of 2009.",46.0,90,5,0.9526176704874916
16105,TR Elliott 2008 Burgonet Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a deeply flavored, earthy wine. You'll find rich raspberry and cherry fruit, but also a mushroomy taste, as well as intense baking spices. Impressively complex, it's fairly tannic, and seems immature. Give it 4–5 years in a good cellar.",42.0,92,5,0.9526176531959204
107262,Martin Ray 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma),"Here's a good, rich Cabernet for drinking now. It satisfies for the elaborate layers of blackberries, cherries and plums, enhanced with spicy, smoky oak. Full-bodied and tannic, it shows lots of elegant complexity for the price.",20.0,87,5,0.9526174588060494
114269,Sojourn 2009 Proprietary Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is marked by intense flavors of blackberry, cherry and currant, with sweet smoky oak, firm, furry tannins and brisk acidity. All of these elements jostle for position, making the wine currently aggressive and unresolved. However, the suggestion of ageability is warranted. Put it to sleep in your cellar for six years and see how it's doing. It could be fine in 2020.",95.0,93,5,0.952617353767663
11693,Trentadue 2009 Block 500 Estate Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Heavy and oaky, with a full-bodied, soft mouthfeel. But it's rich and sweet in cherries, blackberries, plums, mocha and spices. Pretty good price for a nice, everyday Merlot.",15.0,85,5,0.9526170803478243
7707,MacPhail 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Very dry and elegantly silky, this Pinot, from one of the best vineyards in the valley, brims with cherry, red currant, cola, licorice and peppery spice flavors. Seems at its best now and in the short term.",52.0,89,5,0.9526166466643962
66699,Poliziano 1998 Asinone  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"This is a complex bruiser that will appeal to those willing to give it at least three years in the cellar; it's that tight and young now. Oak is a big player on the nose and in the mouth, and the acids are very alive, so as a result some might find it aggressive (all the more reason to lay it down until 2006). There is plenty of earth and minerals throughout, and it's tight as nails on the finish.",45.0,89,5,0.9526160861529974
114141,Boheme 2010 English Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Boheme follows up a successful 2009 vintage of this wine with a 2010 that's also quite good, although not perhaps as opulent. The color is translucent in ruby and garnet, suggesting the wine's delicacy. Grown in the Sebastopol part of the southwest valley, the wine brims in ripe, savory raspberries, persimmons and oak, with precocious acidity that makes the mouth water. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar.",49.0,92,5,0.9526153790164044
23812,Alta Maria 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",25.0,93,5,0.9526113987551651
70123,Stanton 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Sweet and jammy, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries and black cherries, spiced up with cocoa, anise, cinnamon and brown sugar. This soft, tasty Cab is probably at its best now and soon.",75.0,86,5,0.9526097997374167
53109,Bravante 2006 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A Cabernet of considerable heft, showing the big-time tannins the mountain is known for. Below them are very rich blackberry, blueberry, cassis and mineral flavors, leading to a dry, spicy finish. A bit hard and difficult now, but should hit its stride starting in 2012.",60.0,90,5,0.9526070898145946
97833,Celani Family Vineyards 2008 Ardore Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak. Powerful, but not overbearing, this shows an internal coherence that lifts it to a high level of elegant complexity. As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar.",195.0,96,5,0.9525862013739815
13485,De Coelo 2009 Quintus Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lots to like in this dry, silky Pinot Noir. Easy to imagine drinking it with a nice steak with mushrooms.

76407,Antonio Patric 2009 Coombsville Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is very dry, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate, plus complex notes of herbs, spices and minerals. The tannins are a wonder—dusty and interesting. Really good to drink now, yet it should change gradually in the bottle over the next 10 years.",65.0,94,5,0.9499945723134697
54977,Rancho Sisquoc 2009 Flood Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"A good followup to last year's vintage.

24787,Costa de Oro 2008 Gold Coast Vineyard Reserva Oro Rojo Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Soft and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries. It's luxuriously soft and silky, with polished tannins, and lots of people will love it. Would benefit from greater depth and complexity, but it sure is lovely. Drink now.",35.0,90,5,0.9499943951599239
6093,Hawley 2010 Estines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a very big, rich, extracted Pinot. While it's undeniably delicious, it's so stuffed with cherry-pie filling, black raspberry, mocha and cola flavors, it lacks subtlety, especially at this price. Give it a good, long decant and drink now.",42.0,89,5,0.9499943216115965

30046,Zaca Mesa 2009 Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is soft, smooth and refined, with rich, complex blackberry, cassis, bacon, pepper and smoky cedar flavors. Good as it is, it will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years. Almost as good as Zaca Mesa's more expensive Syrahs.",25.0,91,5,0.9499941054600415
72785,Lamborn Family Vineyards 2007 Vintage V Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"So dramatically deep in flavor, it immediately impresses for the depth of blackberries, cassis and minerals, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce now, and the wine shows a precocious immaturity that makes it somewhat coarse. But it clearly has the structure to age well. Should glide through the next dozen years with ease. Production was 875 cases.",110.0,94,5,0.9499939631185617
92037,McPrice Myers 2006 L'Ange Rouge Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little heavy and soft, and while it's technically dry, the wine has a chocolate-covered raspberry taste, sprinkled with anise liqueur, and made to seem sweeter than it really is from high alcohol. Tasty, but needs greater structure and finesse.",36.0,86,5,0.9499937544329763
22295,Cumbre of Vine Hill 2006 Raffaelli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a very good wine, but judging from the acidity and tannins, it will benefit with some time in the cellar. Dry and silky, it shows rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, currants, chocolate-covered mints, anise and cedar that are lush and decadent. Decant now, and should come into its own in mid-2010.",59.0,93,5,0.9499934916818839
115399,Terra Valentine 2006 Wurtele Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Stunning, dramatic, but nowhere near ready to drink. Dry and complex in mountain tannins, the wine displays massively deep flavors of blackberries and cassis, and the new oak is substantial and sweet. Try holding until after 2010, and should develop for an additional six years.",60.0,94,5,0.9499933018509669
113116,Mounts 2007 Estate Grown Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"If you think you don't like Syrah, try this one. It's so pretty, so easy to drink for its soft lushness, but is also quite complex. Offers gentle waves of raspberries, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and pepper that finish bone dry and spicy.",28.0,88,5,0.9499932380862735
95179,Stonestreet 2005 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.",100.0,93,5,0.949993167119382
99307,Goyette 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"This shows lots of blackberry and currant flavors, along with a polished jacket of smoky oak. It's bone dry but a little heavy.

104070,Bjornstad 2008 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Lots of vibrantly ripe fruit in this wine, with mouthfilling flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola. It's delicious in an upfront way, with a supporting structure of acids and tannins and a sweet coat of oak. Drink over the next year or two before it fades.",40.0,90,5,0.9499930319419427
49425,Clos Pepe 2007 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The winemaker rightfully praises this Pinot for having so much fruit at below 14% alcohol. He's right, but there's more to great wine than fruit. The wine is massive in cherries, raspberries and currants, but right now that's about all you get in the way of complexity. Could surprise with some time in the cellar.",54.0,87,5,0.9499930089922017
48972,St. Francis 2007 Montecillo Vineyard Kaarin's Terrace Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This Zin is made in the St. Francis style of dryness at the cost of extremely high alcohol.

82748,Vina Robles 2007 Huerhuero Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A good, dry wine that's stuffed with richly ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Yet it has a tough astringency, a cut of tannins and acids that makes it brittle and limits immediate reward. Could develop in the bottle, but not much beyond 2012.",22.0,87,5,0.9499929301235924
89576,Foxen 7200 2008 Grassini Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"A rich, ripe, oaky Cabernet, from this ambitious little appellation in the warmer, eastern part of the Santa Ynez Valley.

100966,Arista 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows lush, ripe waves of wild mountain raspberries, cherries, red currants and cola, but the texture is a little aggressive in acids and tannins.

55719,Kenwood 2009 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"A picture-perfect Zinfandel from this famous vineyard. It's dry and soft in tannins and acids, and while it's a little high and sweet in alcohol, it's not too much. The raspberry, cherry, tobacco and bacon flavors finish in a swirl of peppery spices.",20.0,91,5,0.949992624700872
67495,Hahn Estates 2007 Meritage (Central Coast),"This is a very ripe wine stuffed with blackberries, cherries and cocoa, but it's also pretty tannic, although sweet oak softens the blow. Feels lush and good, but rustic around the edges. Drink now with beef dishes.",16.0,86,5,0.9499925464950258
55150,Rutherford Grove 2008 Estate Merlot (Rutherford),"If you think you don't like Merlot, try this one. It shows classic Napa Valley structure, with smooth, firm tannins and seductive flavors of sweet cherries, plums and currants. Delicious now with a good steak.",32.0,91,5,0.9499925350067617
31389,Oakville Terraces 2007 Hillside Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An ambitious wine that aims for the fences and hits a double. It's soft and super-fruity, with the sweet, extracted flavors of blackberries and cherries, liberally enhanced with oak, that characterize modern Napa cult-style Cabs. But it lacks some depth and complexity, especially at this inflated price.",104.0,87,5,0.9499925146221013
12230,Faust 2009 The Pact Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well.

55303,Stephen Ross 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Nice and dry, with a silky texture and firm, fine acidity. Good application of oak, too.

93039,Bialla 2008 Vita Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Bialla has held back this 2008 for release nearly a year after the lovely 2009. The wine is soft, complex and drinkable now, with blackberry jam and oak flavors, but it's definitely high in alcohol, which gives it a cellar-limiting heat.",125.0,88,5,0.9499923978516278
67859,Loring Wine Company 2006 Rancho Ontiveros Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The vineyard isn't well-known but deserves to be. It's down the hill from Bien Nacido, in the sweet spot of Santa Maria Valley. Loring's '06 bottling is rich and ripe in cherries, currants, cola and tobacco, but more than that, has a textural complexity that gives it great interest value. Should age, too.

102349,Garnet 2010 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This vineyard has been source to wildly variable Pinot Noirs, but Garnet, has succeeded in wresting a fine Pinot Noir.

113591,River Star 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Nice structure on this dry, smooth Cab, which is made in the modern cult style of soft, immediate likeability.

94881,Von Strasser 2005 Rainin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it. Drily balanced and elegantly constructed, it brims with rich blackberry and black currant flavors, with a fine coating of spicy oak. Best 2012–2018.",75.0,92,5,0.9499921122517447
25504,Textbook 2005 Mise en Place Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years.",44.0,94,5,0.9499920418997264
36826,Jean Edwards 2008 Seventy Four-Forty One Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So ripely soft and delicious, it's drinkable now. Really ple Jean Edwardsases the palate with sweet blackberries, cherries and cassis, accented by smoky oak.

103421,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Devil's Gulch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),"There's a dusty, musty note to this wine that mutes it and doesn't blow off, even after a long time in the glass.

30235,VJB 2004 V Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Strong and direct in licorice, cassis, cocoa and smoky cedar flavors, the wine is balanced with adequate acids. It's also thoroughly dry, a good thing. Could use a bit more polish in the tannic structure, which is on the jagged side. Decant, or age for two or three years.",46.0,88,5,0.9499918442824803
32509,Sierra Madre 2008 Block 216 Clone 5 Pommard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice, cola and sandalwood, this Pinot finishes dry and spicy.

It's awkward now, a tannic, very new-oaky wine with jammy black currant flavors, and seems all over the place. We know from long experience that CDV Cabs age terrifically, and this one might.

They're as hard and firm as a brick wall, and whatever fruit there is, and there's plenty, is effectively hidden from the palate's pleasure. Discerning tasters will detect massive blackberries and black currants, buried deep down like pirate's treasure. It should develop quite well over the next ten or fifteen years.",85.0,93,5,0.9499912947846465
7368,Rutherford Hill 2010 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),"Give this wine 3–5 years in the cellar to let the parts come together. Right now, it's an unconnected mélange of sweet cherry pie, mocha, licorice, toasty oak and dusty tannins. By 2016 it should start to find its harmonious sweet spot.",55.0,92,5,0.9499910701404829
58112,Magistrate 2011 Limited Production Merlot (Central Coast),"This is a sound, everyday Merlot with some special qualities that give it an extra point or two. It's dry and smooth in tannins, with layers of cherries, blackberries, currants and licorice. Not likely to age well, so give it a little time to breathe and drink now.",20.0,86,5,0.9499910255092738
26200,Ferrari-Carano 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Just delicious, offering sweetly ripe blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak.

53625,Ca' Momi 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is the priciest Cab Ca' Momi has released in years, but it's also the best. It's soft, complex and delicious in black currants, chocolate and oak, with wonderfully smooth tannins, and just enough acidity for balance. It's clearly decadent for drinking now through 2020. Beyond that, all bets are off.",68.0,92,5,0.9499909423796625

Compelling, and should develop for a good six years.",33.0,93,5,0.9499906911726774
3871,Saintsbury 2008 Garnet Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Saintsbury's Garnet bottling established the tradition in California of a lighter-style, but no less elegant, Pinot Noir that retails at a decent price.

77551,Minassian-Young 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is an enormously ripe, extracted red wine. It shows California's heat in the jammy raspberries, cherries and chocolate, as sweet and thick as the filling in a pie. Shows the strength of Paso Robles, which is ripeness, and its weaknesses, excessive alcohol, sweetness and a flabby structure.",24.0,84,5,0.949990586320453

4673,En Garde 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Accolades to the winery for holding this wine back longer than most wineries dare to.

101717,Donum 2010 Reserve Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"As ripe as Donum's regular 2010 Russian River Pinot is, this reserve is even richer.

49429,Bradford Mountain 2005 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Young, thick in the mouth, and sweet in briary fruit, this Syrah could be a sleeper. It's really too jammy now, with its wealth of cherries, berries, currants, chocolate and pepper. Unless you like this kind of immediate fruity pleasure, give it a sleep in the cellar.

14434,Keller 2009 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The brisk acidity and tough tannins suggest cellaring this Pinot Noir for a while. To judge by the core of cherries and red currants, it should ride out the years effortlessly. Beyond the fruit is a fine, mushroomy earthiness and a feral quality sometimes found in better Sonoma Coast Pinots. Give it until 2017.",75.0,93,5,0.9499896930714288
28415,Sean Minor 2006 4B Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich is the word for this Merlot. It flatters the palate with jammy black cherries, red currants, anise, cocoa and violets, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Turns a bit one-dimensional, but offers plenty of flavor.",17.0,87,5,0.94998965534781

88957,Promise 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"There's a very good wine here that's yearning to express itself, but it's locked inside a straitjacket of tannins. Feels hard, astringent and resistant in the mouth. But it's huge in concentrated blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, and gives the impression of drama and importance.

38602,Beringer 2004 Chabot Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now.

It's fine to drink now, but will develop bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years.",46.0,93,5,0.949988160459654
34467,Hess 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino-Lake County-Napa),"A very nice, elegant and clean Cab that shows plenty of coastal climate balance. Fully dry, it has oak-accented flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and spice. Good buy at this fair price.",17.0,87,5,0.9499881357462662
28033,Benziger 2008 de Coelo Quintus Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point. However, it seems well able to age, given the balance, and the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and rhubarb fruit. Cellar this fine wine until at least 2014.",69.0,92,5,0.9499880948815691
46455,Merry Edwards 2010 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has had a long relationship with this Westside Road vineyard, which has given her some very great wines. This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability. The wine is lush in raspberries, cherries and currants, yet is elegant and crisp in acidity. You can drink it now, but it will gain in the bottle after 2018.",54.0,94,5,0.9499880757132131
42735,Charles Krug 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Will age for quite a while, gradually shedding fruit and tannins, but you're best off drinking it soon for savory youthful pleasure. Dry and balanced, it's showing lovely blackberry, currant and oak flavors.",29.0,89,5,0.9499880512007712
108044,Gloria Ferrer 2007 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The first of Gloria's 2007 Pinots to be released, and a promising allure to their future block bottlings. The wine is, in a word, superb. It has ripe raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit, but also a wonderful earthiness of mushrooms, and the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. A gorgeous young wine to decant and enjoy now.",22.0,94,5,0.9499880096267417
78369,Kuleto Estate 2009 Villa Vista Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cab is a big, rich wine, and while its power is considerable, it lacks subtlety. There's no question about the intensity of blackberries, cherries and spicy persimmons, unrivaled anywhere in the world. Yet ripeness isn't everything. Hard to see this explosion of fruit going anywhere, so drink soon.",80.0,87,5,0.949987993756655
99117,Martorana 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Good blackberry, black cherry, cola and spice flavors in this Merlot. It's marked by the jagged, sandpapery tannins that often accompany Dry Creek red wines. You can call it rustic, but it's rustic-chic, an interesting wine with some real complexity.",33.0,88,5,0.9499879149252886
89294,MacPhail 2006 Frattey Shams Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A bit heavy in body, and very extracted, this single-vineyard Pinot from Boonville has jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants. Extensive new oak adds layers of caramelized meringue. Tasty, although a bit obvious, the wine should hold its own for 5 years.",55.0,89,5,0.9499878750721557
68902,Acorn 2006 Alegría Vineyard Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Rich and savory, with jammy-sweet, briary blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, tabasco and dusty spice flavors that are intricate and complex.

70177,Rubissow 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Shows the richness of Mount Veeder fruit and also the Rubissow style, which emphasizes massively extracted fruit. Just overwhelms with jammy blackberries, cherries, mocha, licorice and vanilla. The tannins are polished and pretty, being firm yet soft at the same time. Give it a decant and drink now.",50.0,90,5,0.9499876373036342
47883,Cult X 2011 Meritage (Alexander Valley),"You might want to give this intil 2020–2022 in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's pretty tannic, with herb-infused blackberry jam and tea flavors. Frisky acidity is accented by sweet, toasty oak.",56.0,87,5,0.9499876299356824
112165,Mayacamas 2005 Merlot (Mount Veeder),"Dry, tough in tannins and acidic, this Merlot isn't offering much now. Despite a rich, concentrated vein of cherries, it's a hard, almost old-fashioned wine. Your best bet is to age it, but no guarantees. Try after 2012.",35.0,86,5,0.9499876010283028
94959,Andretti 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A big Pinot Noir, extracted and thick in cherry and blueberry pie filling, red currant, sandalwood and dusty spice flavors. Delicious, but soft and atypical for a Pinot, lacking some life and charm. Drink now.",43.0,87,5,0.9499875745842921
76634,Camp 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Lots of sweet, fruity richness in this Cabernet.

32227,Acacia 2006 St. Clair Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Very dry, tart and brittle, this Pinot, from a famous old vineyard that pioneered the Napa side of Carneros, isn't very lush right now. The cherryskin flavors are more bitter and tannic than you expect from most Pinot Noirs. Really needs lamb, steak or similar rich fare to wake it up.",75.0,87,5,0.9499873504006652
67324,Williams Selyem 2011 Peay Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Previous bottlings from this vineyard have been much better. This vintage is intensely ripe, almost Port-like, with cherry pie, cola and red currant flavors, and a hit of sweet oak. The acidity is just fine, but the wine lacks subtlety.",59.0,87,5,0.9499872557703906
73093,Scratch 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Scratch is a very promising inaugural Pinot Noir from Sabrine Rodems, who's also the winemaker for Wrath and Kori. It shows the vibrant fruit of the Highlands, with potent raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, yet is dry and balanced in acids and tannins, with a super-long finish. Possesses that hard-to-define characteristic of class. Great now, and you can hold it several years.",45.0,92,5,0.9499871684543238
82270,Matchbook 2005 Syrah (Dunnigan Hills),"This Syrah isn't the richest red wine, but it is very dry and balanced and, in its own way, quite elegant.

43900,Ballentine 2011 Pocai Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Exceptionally high alcohol gives this Zin a Port-like heat.

9261,Donelan 2008 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"A tough, tannic young wine that will benefit from two or three years in the bottle, but probably no more. It's bone dry and astringent now, with an intense core of blackberries, grilled meat and black pepper. Give it a few hours in a decanter before pouring.",45.0,90,5,0.9499870272009867
76703,Joseph Family 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A very rich, ripe Cabernet, expressive in black cherry, mocha, cola, sweet herb and cedar flavors. It's a little young, so give it 3–4 years in the bottle, but this is not a wine to age for a long time.",36.0,88,5,0.9499869226253914

53311,Trinchero 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A good wine, dry and tannic, but a little one-dimensional in richness. Shows pretty flavors of red and black cherries, with a hint of mint and cocoa. Could be lusher and offer more layers. Call it elegant rather than opulent. Drink now.",50.0,87,5,0.9499864569151613
32232,Hughes Wellman 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Ripe and jammy, this Cab comes from a vineyard east of St. Helena on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. The wine is extremely ripe and jammy, with pronounced blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and currant flavors.

15599,Artesa 2007 Limited Release Foss Valley Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Lots of tannins and zingy acidity in this young 100% Cabernet. That's what the cool climate of Atlas Peak brings. Despite the massive blackberry and cassis richness, the wine is somewhat fierce now, suggesting 4–5 years, and possibly far longer, in a cool cellar.",85.0,88,5,0.9499863192027013
8927,Tamayo Family 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A rich, complex Pinot that shows the intricacies of Santa Lucia Pinot Noir yet retains an immediate drinkability for its silky fruit forwardness.

20066,Liparita 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"After the initial hit of intensely sweet blackberries and oak, there's not a whole lot going on in this 100% Cab. It's high in alcohol, with sweet glycerine and some heat co-starring. The tannins are thick, so you have to wonder if the wine has a future. Yes, but not a long one.

34059,Truchard 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),"Far from a fruit bomb, this is an elegant Cabernet with modest but complex currant, black cherry, cola and herb flavors.

73330,Boheme 2010 Stuller Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The vineyard lies in the Occidental area, a cool part of the southern valley that's vintage-sensitive. The cold 2010 year has resulted in brisk, citrusy acidity that brightens persimmon, cherry and raspberry fruit flavors that are liberally oaked. Hard to say if the wine is a long-term ager, but it's fine now and will be until 2019.",45.0,89,5,0.9499858983832574
109146,Vision Cellars 2006 Las Alturas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Too big by far for a Pinot Noir, this single-vineyard bottling is heavy-handed.

38589,Cefalu' 2004 Michael Anthony Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"This 100% Cab will strike some cult Cabernet addicts as old-fashioned. It's  bone dry and firm in tannins, with an herb and olive tapenade taste to the riper currants and blackberries. Virtually guaranteed to age, this elegant young wine should be best between 2010 and 2016.",55.0,93,5,0.9499857083263441
59981,Ahnfeldt 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very ripe and fruity in the modern style, almost too strong in blackberry jam, black currant and oak flavors that are not particularly subtle or delicate, although the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are significant, but negotiable. The suggestion is ageability. Give it 2–4 years and try again.",45.0,88,5,0.9499856985361197
4898,Black Kite 2009 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Defines a certain California style in the intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, whose sweetness is accented by caramelized oak.

19293,W.H. Smith 2006 Maritime Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the precision and control of Smith's previous Maritime Pinot, marked by a tense, exciting structure. Crisp acids and fine, dusty tannins dance with earthy cherry and cola fruit, herbs and oak to create a complex, tremendously rewarding palate experience. Best now through 2010.",54.0,93,5,0.9499855187147769
11286,Astrale e Terra 2004 Estate Syrah (Atlas Peak),"At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years.",28.0,88,5,0.9499854444941412
9934,Beringer 1996 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity. It's best left alone for a few more years, but it's really very lovely now.",100.0,95,5,0.9499853945082205

112714,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"You might want to age this for a couple years, because it's a little tough in tannins, more so than you might expect from a Napa Merlot. But it's very rich in cherry, red currant, green olive and oak flavors.",45.0,88,5,0.9499850049397185
16119,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Seco Highlands Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Classic Monterey Pinot, dry, crisp, silky and ripe.

104986,Diamond Creek 2007 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it.

12773,Wilson 2011 Molly's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The flavors on this big Zin go beyond ripe blackberries and cherries to include currants, prunes and raisins.

25054,Odfjell 2005 Orzada Malbec (Lontué Valley),"One of Chile's best Malbecs. This vintage is very rich and compact, with blackberry, marzipan and cola aromas. The palate is firm and sturdy, but more like a bench than a plush chair. Superripe and a little clumsy, with really intense cassis and cherry flavors. Fruity almost to the point of being over the top.",20.0,88,5,0.9499830850192412
80464,Notre Vin 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Although this Cab is nearly seven years old, it's still hard and tough in tannins, and the tart acidity suggests it will remain unbalanced for the rest of its life.

104078,Meyer Family Cellars 2008 Spitfire Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Tough tannins give this wine a kick.

3500,Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture.

65264,Kenwood 2010 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"If there's one thing Kenwood knows how to do, it's making proper varietal wines at a good price. Here's another in a string of fine Zinfandels.

36552,Mahoney 2006 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a nice, dry and fairly complex Pinot Noir that makes you think of grilled steaks or roast lamb.

19363,Sanctuary 2005 Mariah Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"Robust and briary, this Zin is bone-dry and pretty tannic, with earthy flavors of blackberries, tobacco, currants and spices. Could mellow with age, but will never be particularly complex.",25.0,85,5,0.9470519700917241

39055,Gundlach Bundschu 2009 Heritage Selection Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir from Gundlach Bundschu in many years, maybe ever, but it's also easily their best. It's absolutely delicious in cherries, pomegranates and spices, with a wonderful earthiness that grounds it. So silky and complex, so rewarding to drink now. Great to see this veteran winery coming out with a wine this fine.",55.0,93,5,0.9470516676741366
37178,Schug 2007 Heritage Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a Pinot that needs some time in the cellar. It's currently laden with heavy tannins, which accentuate the dry austerity. However, there's a beautiful heart of black cherries and cola, with a long, spicy finish. Should develop for a few years.",40.0,89,5,0.9470516465408741
69006,Carrefour 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, thick and jammy sweet, this Cab tasted a bit juvenile in the winter of 2009. With blackberry and cherry pie filling, chocolate, licorice and pepper flavors, it might develop harmony over the next six years.",42.0,87,5,0.9470516347313972
2696,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",35.0,85,5,0.9470516263456566
116330,Novy 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"It shows ultrarich tannins and a flavor complexity ranging from briary wild blackberries and prunes to currants, nettles, sweet tea and softened cola. It's absolutely dry, despite or perhaps because of very high alcohol. The wine is unapologetic about that ripeness, instead asking only to be happily paired with barbecue.",20.0,87,5,0.9470516160316562
11264,River Road 2011 Stephanie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Pretty good  Pinot for the price, showing Russian River silkiness, dryness and acidic structure. The cola, sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors are classic, if a little thin. Drink up.",20.0,86,5,0.9470515036565582
8831,Sensorium 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A pretty nice young Cab, though the weather was too hot and the wine is deficient in acidity. But the flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and new oak are delicious, and the tannins are smooth and silky.",40.0,89,5,0.9470514737996013
60676,Rangeland 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"A flamboyant Cabernet. Flavors of blackberry jam, currants, mocha and sweet, smoky oak flood the mouth. Fortunately, they're controlled by firm tannins. The sweetness is partly from the glycerine of high alcohol. Drink over the next few years with a great steak.",32.0,88,5,0.9470514421851071
64073,Waits-Mast 2010 Archer Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Lots of acidity in this dry, yet silky, Pinot Noir. It shows flavors of tart cranberries, persimmons and pomegranates, with a jacket of sweet oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low, which gives it a welcome delicacy. Should develop bottle notes over the next eight years, but it's so good now, there's no reason not to drink up.",36.0,90,5,0.9470514098033452
2041,Kirkland Signature 2007 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit.

Delicious now and through 2014.",22.0,87,5,0.9470513489809029
52985,Furthermore 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This bottling shows the richness that a well-grown Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir can achieve, seemingly effortlessly. You'll find deeply ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, wrapped in a silky texture. However, there's quite a bit of sharpness that draws into question the wine's ageability.",50.0,88,5,0.9470512861856712

108199,Siduri 2011 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Although this is silky and elegant, it is one of Siduri's higher alcohol Pinot Noirs.

53043,Manzoni 2006 Family Estate Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Too soft and sweet, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, anise and cocoa.

112880,Testarossa 2010 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Has to be one of the most forward, immediately drinkable Pisoni Pinots out there.

108567,Surh Luchtel 2005 Page Nord Vineyard Syrah (Oak Knoll District),"Cab specialist Surh Luchtel has had some years to figure out how to make their Page Nord Syrah, and judging by this '05 bottling, they're right on track. The wine is firmer in structure than the soft '04, but the flavors are no less startling. Blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and pepper flood the palate, wrapped into sumptuous tannins. Best now and for a few years.",30.0,92,5,0.9470508949422081

47426,Audelssa 2006 Summit Red (Sonoma Valley),"Fans of sheer fruit will exult in this wine for its masses of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, chocolate and even raspberries that flood the palate. Beyond that, it offers good tannins and fine acidity. There isn't much complexity or layering, but it sure is tasty.",52.0,87,5,0.9470507639754076
102815,In Re 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"Tough, dry and tannic, this Cabernet punches its way through the mouth like an angry kickboxer.

25316,Hawkes 2005 Stone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Very young now and a bit rude, with upfront primary fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries and new oak.

22707,Stephen Ross 2006 Aubaine Vineyards Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Very delicious in flavor, with rich cherries, red currants, cola, caramelized oak, anise, cocoa and pepper, and the texture is as smooth as silk.

66986,Cobblestone 2005 Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity. Even so, it's so ripe in blackberries and currants it's almost drinkable now, with a good decant. But you're best off cellaring a good 4–6 years.",69.0,90,5,0.947050434954762
2965,J Vineyards & Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle.

46676,Calera 2006 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt.

Dazzles the mouth with the essence of blackberries, cassis, cherry tart with the smoky crust, chocolate and exotic sandalwood, wrapped into the richest, finest tannins you can imagine.

88317,Frias 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"A near twin to the excellent 2006, and as ageable. It's a big wine, but immature, with scads of blackberry and cherry jam fruit, smoky new oak and stiff tannins.

9317,Falcone 2009 Mia's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is just delicious, showing all the fine attributes you'd want from a California Cabernet, except ageability.

20002,Freeman 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Very ripe and deliciously forward in cherries, cola, bacon, anise and sweet smoky sandalwood, with silky tannins. The acidity is a bit low, giving the wine a softness that limits ageability. Now–2011.",44.0,88,5,0.9470500493478357

111343,Ledson 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",95.0,88,5,0.9470499556471336
16975,W.H. Smith 2005 Bronze Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Starting out as a very tannic, closed wine, this is one for the cellar. The question is how long. It's a big, dry, ripe Cab, with extracted blackberry, blueberry and cedar flavors, and while it should soften over the next five years, it doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul.",42.0,89,5,0.9470498301687982
21185,Martin Ray 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This winery's Santa Barbara bottling has established a track record as a fine, elegant Pinot Noir at a fair price.

33207,Failla 2011 Occidental Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"You want to give this wine 5–6 years in the cellar, at the very least, to let its components come together.

42281,Rancho Zabaco 2006 Toreador Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a big, tannic Zinfandel from a premier vineyard now owned by Gallo. The flavors are bigtime, offering an eruption of blackberries, currants, spiced rum punch, chocolate and licorice. Think of it as Zinfandel on steroids.

87086,Olabisi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cabernet is still too hard in tannins and acids, both which emphasize the wine's rasping dryness. There's a good core of black currants that might emerge after a long time in the cellar. Perhapstash it away until 2024 and see what happens.",65.0,86,5,0.9470493570270128
60811,Errazuriz 1999 Wild Ferment La Escultura Estate Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"This is what vineyard selection and winemaker intervention can do to enrich a wine.

29820,Kynsi 2006 ZB Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price.

90138,River Star 2004 Syrah (Paso Robles),"The dryness hits you first, then the tannins. This is a Syrah that's hard and astringent, almost aggressive. But then the core of blackberries and cherries kicks in, turning spicy and licorice-like on the finish. Suddenly, the wine is interesting.

By itself, it's a little aloof, with firm tannins and acids hiding black currant, pepper and tobacco flavors. Better with cheeses, barbecue, pizza.",15.0,86,5,0.947048523254052
92281,Boëté 2007 Saunders Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),"At more than six years of age, this 100% Cabernet is dropping its primary blackberry fruit flavors, revealing its underlying flaws. It remains severely dry, acidic and tannic, with mushrooms emerging, while high alcohol gives it a bite of heat.",36.0,85,5,0.9470483959184106
95338,Corley 2007 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Makes for nice drinking right now, because of the abundance of forward, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit. On the other hand, the tannins are considerable, and the acidity is evident, so it could age over the next six years.",55.0,90,5,0.9470483847814924
30754,Highway 12 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"A polished, complex wine to drink now, despite considerable tannins. Give it a decant for a few hours to let it mellow.

112780,Hearst Ranch 2009 Babicora Malbec (Paso Robles),"Tastes both underripe and overripe at the same time, with some polished cherry flavors in the middle. Lots of acidity makes it sour. A dry, somewhat rustic wine that rich meats and cheeses will help fatten.",30.0,85,5,0.9470482612560519
63784,Novy 2008 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This extraordinarily rich Syrah swamps the mouth with jammy blackberries, raspberries and cherries. There's nothing subtle about it. But it's basically dry and properly balanced with acids and tannins, which gives it needed balance. Drink now and through 2014 to experience the youthful opulence.",33.0,89,5,0.9470481493687433
104599,Geyser Peak 2005 Block Collection Walking Tree Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.",25.0,91,5,0.9470481208677332
86721,Bonaccorsi 2010 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows exuberant fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak.

26641,Diamond Creek 2010 Gravelly Meadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"The winery has hardly changed its winemaking formula over the decades. Gravelly Meadow remains toughly closed, dry and tannic in youth, despite its core of blackberry and cherry fruit. While the wine is flamboyantly forward by Diamond Creek standards, it would be a crime to drink it before 2020. It's so balanced and complex, it will easily age until then, and probably far longer.",200.0,94,5,0.9470480903927345

44225,Vermeil 2008 Jean Louis Vermeil Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"There's no disrespect to say this Cabernet is fun to drink.

67483,Ghost Block 2009 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Sweet in blackberry, blueberry marmalade and cassis flavors, this has notable acidity that provides a scouring mouthfeel. It's a bit rustic now, especially with its jagged tannins, but the finish is dry and long. Sometimes these wines mellow and age well, but this one doesn't seem destined to benefit from cellaring.",100.0,87,5,0.9470474195335163

71304,Thomas Fogarty 2005 Gist Ranch Estate Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Bring this down to the cellar and let it sleep for at least 5–6 years. It's super-tannic, giving a hard, angular mouthfeel, even though the blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are powerful.

13249,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative 2008 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There are lush, profound flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon and sweet smoky sandalwood in this wine, and it has the silky mouthfeel of a fine coastal Pinot. On the debit side is a certain harshness and sharpness of tannins that suggests green seeds.",44.0,87,5,0.947047204621861
51701,Occidental Road Cellars 2008 Horseshoe Bend Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This has plenty of cherry, red licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins.

97404,Williams Selyem 2009 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County),"A very good, impressively concentrated Pinot Noir, with flashy, ripe cherry, blackberry and currant flavors.

10742,Calera 2006 Reed Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Shows a dryness and earthiness that mark Calera's most ageworthy Pinot Noirs. But that doesn't mean it's not good now. It is, with impressive black cherry, licorice, bacon, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into a drily crisp, silky texture. Drink through 2012, at least.",50.0,92,5,0.9470469768043728
4145,Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California),"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony.

105322,Windbreak 2006 Sarmento Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A bit tart in acidity, this polished Pinot needs rich beef or lamb to cut through. It's a lovely wine, fully dry and balanced, with rich flavors of cherries, cola and anise. Drink now.",40.0,89,5,0.9470467789654653
96426,Pali 2007 Thorn Ridge Ranch Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Ripe and crisp and rich, in the manner of this fine vintage, offering an explosion of cherries, currants, anise and vanilla-scented cedar.

76642,Envy 2010 Calistoga Estate Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This bottling has a solid track record from Envy, but the 2010 vintage, good as it is, is their least successful in years. While it's luscious with blackberry and blueberry jam, mocha and oak sweetness, it's one-dimensional, and lacking ageworthiness.

112801,Rochioli 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is Rochioli's estate Pinot—without a vineyard designation. It's a fabulous wine, showing the winery's signature power, complexity and balance. The flavors are rich, with notes of red berries, persimmons, red currants, bacon and cola.

63145,Acacia 2010 Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"As delicious as Pinot Noir gets, this has fireworks of raspberries, cherries and cola, and a sweet, mushroom-like essence of earth.

31289,Patz & Hall 2008 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Showing an enormous blast of cherries and raspberries, this Pinot is saved from being a fruit bomb by earthy, mushroomy complexities and a hit of acidity that makes the mouth water.

112007,Krutz 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very ripe, with powerful grilled blackberry, cassis and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into strong tannins.

81543,Talley 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Talley's basic estate Pinot can be good, and it can be ordinary. The '06 is pretty tannic and direct. It's a hard, tough wine that's not particularly lush, although it's clean and properly varietal. You'll find cherry and currant flavors that veer into raisins.",36.0,86,5,0.9470449227265945
25115,Opus One 2006 Red (Napa Valley),"A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish.

95757,Notre Vin 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine. Should begin to throw sediment and mellow in seven or eight years, and could go the distance to 2020 and beyond.",150.0,94,5,0.9470435310175614
48781,Guarachi Family 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, although it's certainly well made and delicious. Floods the mouth with cherry and raspberry pie-filling fruit, and the smoky, caramelized oak has a granola sweetness. Drink now.",65.0,87,5,0.9470433753015185

106830,V. Sattui 2005 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Robust in tannins, with crisp, fruity acidity, this Cab has very ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors that have seen their share of smoky oak.

102855,Perbacco Cellars 2005 Dionysus Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Far richer and more concentrated than the winery's regular '05 Pinot, this is a true reserve. It shows the same dryness and silky texture, but the spicy fruit is more intense in cherries and black raspberries, veering into cassis and anisette.

112175,Mounts 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Dry Creek Valley),"A little too hot and brawny in tannins, which provides a cut across the palate that interferes with pleasure.

84491,Roadhouse Winery 2010 Orange Label Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Dry and silky, this is a good Pinot Noir, though it's a little too ripe, which gives the blackberry and cherry notes a pruny, hot taste. Try it with beef stew and prunes to echo the flavors.",48.0,85,5,0.9437434528488113
26651,Castello di Amorosa 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"They held this Cab back for nearly four years, but it's still pretty closed and tannic.

It does not seem like a cellar candidate.",60.0,84,5,0.9399901352684573
22049,Due Cani 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This wine, even at the age of four-plus years, remains dry, tannic and acidic. It has modest raspberry and cherry jam fruit, but isn't going anywhere.",43.0,85,5,0.9399901107364045
71433,Villa Mt. Eden 2006 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows enough fanciness to make it worth the price. Although it has no possibilities of improving with age, it's a fine, softly gentle Cabernet to drink now. Shows correct blackberry, black currant and oak flavors.",15.0,87,5,0.9399900842420524
23755,Sixteen by Twenty 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lush and ripe, made in the modern California cult style of flamboyantly sweet blackberries, cassis and chocolate, soft tannins and immediate appeal. Defines richness and opulence, if not complexity. Drink now–2014.",44.0,89,5,0.939990067349138
27002,Vellum 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Lots of characteristic Cabernet flavor in this wine. Blackberrry jam and cassis liqueur flavors flood the mouth, heady and flashy and long in the finish.

115999,Babcock 2009 The Loin Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"There are good, dry flavors in this Cabernet. It's a little on the coarse side, but shows lots of extraction to the blackberries and black currants. The tannins are hard and firm, and not likely to age out, so drink up.",50.0,87,5,0.9399899287246882
55955,Sterling 2005 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),"The best Sterling reserve Merlots are ageworthy. The others are merely tannic. This '05 straddles the line. It's certainly a dry, tannicly astringent wine that shuts down the palate. But you'll find some rich black cherry and currant flavors. Roll the dice and give it through 2010 to come around.",65.0,88,5,0.9399898430555126
12100,Bentley 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Soft, smooth and delicious, this offers a beautiful example of the modern cult style of flashy drinkability.

54818,Fernwood 2007 Estate Grown Redwood Retreat Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"You'll find thick tannins and soft acidity in this wine, which offers direct, jammy blackberry and cassis flavors.

104658,Robert Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Shows everything that's noble about Oakville, from the wonderful, dusty tannins to the dryness and overall balance. Lovely, with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Could have more depth, though.",45.0,89,5,0.9399896838676279
30154,Proulx 2010 Swiss Colina Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is a big, rich, ripe Zinfandel that tastes hotter and headier than its official alcohol reading of 14.6% abv. It's sweet with black cherry jam and raisins, with a chocolatey finish. Not for everyone, but a good example of the ripe Paso Robles style.",30.0,86,5,0.9399896145642895
26690,Martin Ray 2011 Reserve Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"This is a delicious Merlot for drinking now. It's Martin Ray's best in years, a dry, smooth, soft wine, with elaborate cherry pie, blackberry jam and oak flavors that are complex and spicy.",22.0,89,5,0.9399894615604772
71429,Simple Math Cellars 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A lighter, more elegant style of Cabernet, dry and classy. Likeable for its balance of acids, tannins, alcohol and oak, and rich blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now.",40.0,87,5,0.9399894233661032
64036,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2009 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Great price on a Merlot this good. Most others would charge $25 or more, but Goldschmidt has held the line. It appeals for the soft tannins and easy flavors of raspberries, cherries, cocoa and sweet, smoky oak. Drink now.",15.0,88,5,0.9399893566904206
93696,Chimney Rock 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"You'll want to give this young Cab some time in the cellar, because it's locked down in tannins. Buried underneath the astringency is a wealth of sweet black currants and savory anise and sandalwood. Try after 2011.",62.0,91,5,0.9399893159462652
40318,JR Wine 2005 Cork Tree Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A polished, elegant Merlot, with good structure framing deep flavors of currants, carob, violets and anise. The thick tannins suggest a good steak. Now through 2009.",38.0,90,5,0.9399893127056388

97959,Ventana 1999 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"You want to like this wine more than you do, because it's from a great vineyard and a great vintage. The problem is thinness. It's got great bones, superb texture and dry tannins, and it's easy to taste the quality of the blackberry, pepper-infused fruit because it flatters the palate. But everything is diluted. —S.H.",20.0,85,5,0.9399892161551715
8701,Envy 2007 Envy Estate Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Very ripe, to the point of overripe. The blackberries and black currants veer into raisins, and there's a hint of raisinskin tartness that, combined with the strong tannins, adds to the tough mouthfeel. Will probably soften with age, without necessarily gaining complexity.",45.0,86,5,0.9399891608698773
82518,Aril 2009 Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is a lovely, gentle Syrah for drinking now with upscale fare. It's soft in both tannins and acids, making it velvety in the mouth, and the blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors are, in a word, delicious.",45.0,91,5,0.9399891520811364
83537,Peloton 2011 Lunacy Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Ripe blackberry, cherry and toasty oak flavors mark this Cab. It's soft in acids and tannins and high in alcohol, which gives it a glyceriney sweetness on the finish. Drink up.",37.0,85,5,0.9399890570816624
