59473,Gary Farrell 2013 100% Skin Fermented Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak. It's not for everyone.

99093,Failla 2013 Haynes Vineyard Chardonnay (Coombsville),"Floral, this crisp white starts out in quiet contemplation, offering an abundance of fresh-squeezed citrus and minerality.

99098,Forgeron 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended from eight different vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine displays aromatic nuances of toast and spice along with pear and peach.

99099,Friedeman 2013 UV Lancel Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This white has a bit more meat on its bones than its non-vineyard designated companion, the grapes from a Ulises Valdez-farmed site, always a good sign. Structured and substantial, it shows oak and even a whiff of petroleum darting in between the crisper elements of apple and stone fruit, the finish entirely steely.",45.0,90,9,0.9789773061688091
99251,Starmont 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Light-bodied and modestly priced, this is a wine for a wide circle of friends, great for midweek meals and larger weekend gatherings.

100281,Pellegrini 2013 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Rich and creamy, this beguiling wine offers a counterweight of lightness and balance, finding as much lemon and lime zest as baked apple and pear within its layers of flavor.

100685,St. Francis 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"A tremendous value, this white is light and floral, soft in honeyed stone fruit and pineapple.

100753,Decoy 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Well made in large quantity, this wine offers fleshy tropical papaya around a structure of toasty oak and vanilla. Medium in body and length, it's balanced with a crisp finish.",20.0,88,9,0.9789773061688091
100757,Esser 2013 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"This is an ambitiously lean style for a widely available brand, showing reserved tension.
