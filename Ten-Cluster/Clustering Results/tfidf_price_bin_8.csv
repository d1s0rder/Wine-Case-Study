82295,Palmina 2009 Nebbiolo (Santa Barbara County),"Not only is this appellation blend the cheaper Nebbiolo offered by Steve Clifton's Italian varietal-focused winery, it's the best right out of the bottle. Bright strawberry, sweet rose, leather, star anise, cardamom, black-cherry-laced gingerbread and vanilla show on the rich and full nose. The tannins part to open dried strawberry, plum, rose hip and earthy flavors, proving both manly in presence but feminine in delicacy.",40.0,95,8,0.2656079904835642,20-40
104008,Clendenen Family 2013 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This bottling showcases Jim Clendenen's brilliance at making light wines packed with flavor.

There's a salt and white pepper quality to the palate, where wild sage and more chapparal spice decorates the pomegranate and red plum fruit flavors.",50.0,96,8,0.30953365070065775,above 40
104006,Au Bon Climat 2013 Knox Alexander Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The condensed pomegranate aroma on the nose of this bottling from Jim Clendenen is beautifully spiced with star anise, tobacco leaf, dried ginger and cinnamon. The palate shows chai and Indian spice—accents to the cranberry fruit that rides a fine line between ripe and tart. Although light in body, the tannic structure is firm enough to cellar for decades. Drink now–2033.",50.0,96,8,0.2526158753077994,above 40
75177,Au Bon Climat 2013 Isabelle Pinot Noir (California),"Beautiful aromas of ripe red cherry and cherry blossoms mix with rose-laced potpourri, dust, cola and vanilla on the nose of this best-barrel bottling by Jim Clendenen, named after his daughter. Bright and zesty acidity grabs the palate's immediate attention, making the mouth water as flavors of tart cherry, rust, marinated olive and fig come forth, finishing in a very earthy way.",50.0,95,8,0.2737927137387686,above 40
98022,Anton Bauer 2012 Reserve Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Wagram),"Earthiness, undergrowth and juicy wild strawberries tinged with wet oak leaf dominate the nose and palate of this exemplary wine. It is exquisitely silky and profound on the palate, with fleeting, gossamer tannins. With time, ripe red-cherry notions appear. The finish is complex and nuanced, with lovely earth, spice and fruit sensations.",50.0,96,8,0.24539959522884708,above 40
7955,Melville 2014 Clone 115 Indigene Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity.",50.0,95,8,0.2817502451602301,above 40
40693,Waits-Mast 2012 Deer Meadows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This full-bodied wine has a treasure trove of flavor complexity and great balance.

It's delicious, and best to drink after 2017.",55.0,95,8,0.27158274942468824,above 40
28059,Limerick Lane 2014 Rocky Knoll Estate Grown Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A perennial knockout, this vintage delivers as always, combining 7% Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Syrah from the estate into the mix. Altogether, it opens in a field of wildflowers aromatic before unfurling tart acidity to keep freshly layered soft, supple tannin and red cherry and berry. Sprinklings of white pepper and clove factor in.",58.0,96,8,0.2448063476693855,above 40
47361,Scar of the Sea 2013 Block Q Old Vine Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This wine's aromas are perfectly pretty but with a sharp edge, blending tight boysenberry, raspberry and red-apple with lilac and scarlet-red rose-petal florality and an anise-peppercorn spice.

The palate offers an amazingly cohesive and zesty experience, combining piquant cranberry and tart raspberry with slate-driven minerality and a persistent woody spice. The texture is soft, but lifted by strong acidity.",64.0,96,8,0.2566590623331509,above 40
98401,Pali 2014 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump and ripe Montmorency cherry kicks off the aromas on this bottling, followed by rain-on-slate minerality, slight hints of cola and a growing sense of sour cranberry. The palate also begins with riper red fruit before diving into extreme minerality and intriguing texture. Then comes tart plums and cranberries, all dusted by savory touches of white pepper. It's quite a ride.",65.0,96,8,0.2636672694186594,above 40
97929,Williams Selyem 2013 Westside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.",69.0,98,8,0.24705764545661446,above 40
76128,Testarossa 2006 Cuvée Niclaire Pinot Noir (California),"Of all Testarossa's 2006 Pinots, this is the most complex, and also the most ageworthy. Offers a flood of cherry, red currant, Dr. Pepper, raspberry, licorice, vanilla cookie and oaky spice flavors that are fantastically intense and interesting. Interestingly, this bottling is one of Testarossa's highest-alcohol Pinots. Great now and for a good six more years.",75.0,96,8,0.2635886209049703,above 40
108411,Sea Smoke 2013 Ten Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a top bottling from one of the appellation's first superstar wineries.

42807,Wayfarer 2012 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Crafted from estate-grown fruit—a marriage of Pommard and Swan clones—Golden Mean comes from three distinct vineyard blocks, the Pommard fermented whole-cluster. It opens with dark, ripe layers of lush cherry-vanilla, the wine concentrated and rich in oak yet balanced in acidity. On the finish is a mix of leather, licorice and wild herb. Tuck it away through 2020–2022.",115.0,96,8,0.24754045741565125,above 40
4061,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core.

28606,Luciano Sandrone 2005 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo),"One of the most exciting names in Barolo, with fruit from one of the most celebrated vineyard crus, this vintage of Cannubi Boschis is a real treasure. Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time.",165.0,95,8,0.26153784122000906,above 40
74217,Staglin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",175.0,96,8,0.24986159817455134,above 40

Drink through 2026.",290.0,95,8,0.2969153329258145,above 40
50990,Henschke 2010 Hill of Grace Shiraz (Eden Valley),"Is this the Yin to Grange's Yang? The wines are completely different, yet almost always destined to be discussed together. The 2010 HoG is aromatic and bright, with raspberry and cranberry fruit notes, hints of mint and a pinch of peppery spice. It's full-bodied, but with elegant, supple tannins that ease gently into a long, crisp finish. Drink now–2030.",820.0,96,8,0.2757997290293101,above 40
