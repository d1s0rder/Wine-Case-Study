From a mix of granite and the region's famed Cambrian red soils, this wine offers ripe blue and red fruit, florals and a peppery, olivey punch.

69827,Frankland Estate 2014 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),"Despite its modest alcohol content, this is a medium-bodied dry wine.

99177,Enoteca Five 2011 Alegria Vineyards Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),"Last year, the winery sourced their Cab Franc grapes from Lodi. The wine was very good, but this one's even better.

911,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry.

So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",75.0,88,8,0.26098496607377697
16324,La Marea 2015 Besson Vineyard Old Vine Grenache (Santa Clara Valley),"There's a distinctive old-school quality that comes from these century-old vines, which make a slightly lighter wine with intriguing, almost pre-aged aromas of dried cherry, balsamic raspberry and salt-and-pepper spice. The palate is driven by a crushed rock texture and a bright acidity that drives deep into the finish, with flavors of aged cola and dried red fruit.

The nose starts with notes of raw meat, bright red fruit, orange peel, baking spice and tar.

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers.

41841,Montecillo 1996 Reserva  (Rioja),"Tasty tart fruit, leather and tobacco flavors in this taut, medium-weight wine are supported by quite racy acidity, rendering it somewhat astringent.

There is a noticeable tannic structure to the sip, where red-cherry and rose-petal flavors are quite mellow, refreshing and very quaffable. Time may add more complexity, but it's fun and lively now.",29.0,89,8,0.2490134006650747
2466,Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",20.0,87,8,0.24899234217294866
81895,Coyote Canyon 2010 H/H Estates Michael Andrews Coyote Canyon Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A blend of Tempranillo, the seldom seen (in Washington) Graciano and Grenache, this wine is direct and fruity with notes of raspberry, char and barrel spices.

43334,Castello Monte Vibiano Vecchio 2004 Villa Monte Vibiano Sangiovese (Umbria),"Here's a no-fuss Sangiovese blend that exhibits measured tones of red fruit, spice, cola, balsam notes and dried flowers. It is full of delicate, elegant tones in the mouth and has a light touch on the palate: It's not too thick and has enough natural acidity to be refreshing and tight on the finish. Enjoy it with cream or butter-based dishes.",12.0,86,8,0.2489569609339744

86611,Chilcas 2007 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Maule Valley),"Fresh, light aromas of raspberry and milk chocolate give the wine legitimacy, but for the most part it's simply a lean, sassy Pinot with racy red-fruit flavors, warmth and a touch of sweet oak. Rudimentary but varietally correct with few flaws or virtues. Good but wholly basic.",19.0,85,8,0.24889047560598454
18698,Capanna 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,"There's a steady, balanced approach to this Brunello that sees seamless integration of red fruit, cassis, leather, cola and dried rosemary aromas. Bright acidity only serves to underline its overall liveliness.

108463,Sanford 2016 Rose of Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Light pink in color with a slight yellowish orange hue, this delicate bottling shows light plum and strawberry on the nose along with a prominent chalky character.

102406,Moshin 2013 Rosalina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A high mark of acidity complements the crisp flavors of cherry, strawberry and cranberry here, accented by woody forest notes and a bitter, savory component of black tea.

21259,Left Coast Cellars 2015 Cali's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is still pretty stiff and tight through the midpalate, with fruit ranging from cranberry to raspberry and sour cherry. Tannins leave a slightly green impression; the wine doesn't seem ripe and full flavored. Some extra bottle age might improve it. Drink 2020 to 2024.",24.0,88,8,0.24882528742988327
49004,Corliss Estates 2006 Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A substantial Bordeaux blend that trips into the palate on cat's feet—a delicate touch that gradually gains mass and dimension. It's compact and balanced, with a core of red fruit, a floral top note, and complex layers of mineral and metal. Give it time to open up, and see how the spicy fruit seamlessly mingles with satiny tannins; it scales up and out without being blocky or tiring.",65.0,94,8,0.2487909508332456
48248,Hudson-Chatham 2014 River's Edge Casscles Vineyards Red (New York),"A highly unusual blend of Burdin, a rare French hybrid, and Chambourcin grapes, this red wine offers delicate maraschino-cherry and berry flavors.

51023,Clos Henri 2013 Petit Clos Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A French-owned outpost in the South Pacific, Clos Henri seems to be finally coming of age. This entry-level offering delivers a hint of smoky, fumé character, but also plenty of ripe fruit, ranging from fig, melon and stone fruit to zestier notes of passion fruit.

54618,Johann Heinrich 2011 Cupido Ange de l'amour Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"The vanilla spice and smokiness of new oak dominates the nose, the palate however is subtle and smooth where dark berry fruit is edged by smoky spice.

1338,Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",20.0,86,8,0.24870760218484828

Deliciously spicy with cranberry, raspberry and other red fruit flavors, this tightly wound wine will reward decanting. The minerality and supple tannins suggest that it may be cellared as well.",45.0,92,8,0.24870131848156496

111045,Bodegas Escudero 2015 Solar de Becquer  (Rioja),"Punchy raspberry and red-plum aromas are light and airy. That also describes the palate, which is dilute and lacks stuffing.

34820,Wrath 2011 Boekenoogen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's something magical in the dirt of this vineyard, and it shines extra bright in this bottling.

59922,Ward Johnson Winery 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Kiona. Though a bit light for Red Mountain fruit, this is flavorful and shows some complexity. It marries tart red berries with streaks of tar, iodine and licorice, then moves into barrel flavors of mocha and butterscotch.

69599,Foundry Vineyards 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine seems a bit reduced right out of the bottle. Give it plenty of oxygen, and light blueberry fruit flavors emerge.

With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate.

53699,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2009 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body.

On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes.

90494,Thibault 2014 Fernand & Sons Pinot Noir (Coteaux du Giennois),This earthy wine presents barnyard flavors over the riper red fruit and licorice flavors. Drink now when the fruit is at its best.,18.0,83,8,0.23531016527207563
25926,Yamhill Valley 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Leathery, dried cherry fruit flavors are set against streaks of earth, herb and a hint of barnyard. It's soft and eminently accessible, the tannins smooth and supple, with a hint of vanilla.",25.0,87,8,0.23530405331928117
89401,Angel Vine 2015 The Cluster Fus Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is 80% Mourvèdre, 11% Zinfandel and 9% Primitivo.

The flavors are pure and tart, bringing a real sense of vibrancy to the core cranberry flavor.",28.0,91,8,0.23529573501627224
8366,Bonny Doon 2009 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce",38.0,92,8,0.23529453235521505
25782,Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Les Gélinottes Syrah-Grenache (Ventoux),"Masses of black cherries and blackberries ultimately come across as a bit simple, but satisfying. There's plenty of flavor in this medium-bodied red, and the fruit is fresh rather than confected, with a hint of cocoa on the finish. Drink now–2020.",15.0,87,8,0.23529106863137297
65785,Four Sisters 2013 Shiraz (Central Victoria),"Blended from several inland sites, this is a good value in spice-driven Shiraz. Cinnamon, clove and vanilla lead the way, backed by strawberry and raspberry fruit. The finish is long, tart and slightly dusty, marked by just a hint of maple syrup. Drink now–2018.",14.0,88,8,0.2352634771251766
43328,Gere Attila 2004 Kopár Cuvée Red (Villány),"All of the hallmarks of a good Bordeaux blend are here—earthy, wooded spice, rich fruit flavors, a hearty character. The wine is elegant and assertive, but a slight red berry tartness, oak sweetness and heat throw its balance off just slightly. The overall impression, though, is good. Pair with beef stew or grilled lamb for a real treat.",50.0,86,8,0.2352622781426514
58874,Schramsberg 2011 Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"This rosé seems elegant all the way through. The color is a light salmon, the aromas are slightly earthy, with touches of baking spices, jasmine and fresh baked bread. A grand blend of rich flavors spreads across the palate while fresh acidity and lively bubbles give a vivid mouth feel and carry the mild cherry and cinnamon flavors to the finish.",43.0,92,8,0.23526197239145116
36137,Januik 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"In 2008, Januik made a single-vineyard Syrah from Lewis Vineyard fruit; now the winery has sourced fruit from Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, one of the superstar spots on Red Mountain. A compact wine that snaps right into focus, this offers varietal flavors of fig, berry and plum. A streak of smooth chocolate weaves through the finish, along with a hint of red licorice and underlying slate-like minerality.",35.0,92,8,0.23525870708995605
85219,Meinklang 2013 Graupert Zweigelt (Burgenland),"Savory, earthy notes similar to soy precede plump and fleshy notes of almost overripe black cherry and plum. The palate is light and fresh but bouncy with full fruitiness and the slightest tannic texture and a lip-smacking finish. A summer red of sorts that could even be chilled.",24.0,90,8,0.2352581585824144
97573,Flying Dreams 2011 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Still quite locked up, this wine displays initial aromas of cocoa and vanilla (from 20% new American oak) along with plum, medicine cabinet and raspberry. Sweet fruit flavors are backed by firm tannins and mouthwatering acids.",36.0,88,8,0.2352539041759607
80533,Efeste 2012 Big Papa Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this wine is mostly Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards, with Kiona and Red Willow rounding it out. The aromas bring immediate appeal, with pure notes of black cherry, fresh and dried savory herbs and crushed granite, showing pleasing complexities. The palate is tightly wound, showing a fine sense of depth that is balanced by bright acid and firm tannins. The finish lingers. It's a compelling example of the variety.",60.0,93,8,0.23524878205343594

104671,Ippolito 1845 1995 Ripe del Falco Riserva Superiore  (Cirò Classico),"Ripe del Falco is a successful experiment in the aging ability of Gaglioppo, a native variety of Calabria in Southern Italy. The light-bodied, crimson-colored wine shows tertiary aromas of spicy dried fruit, red licorice and wild mushroom. Not everyone will like it, but if you fancy yourself an enological archeologist, give it a try: The tannins are fine-grained and the delicate wine has aged well over the years.",52.0,88,8,0.23522844417146965
44537,Montaribaldi 2007 Borzoni  (Barolo),"Barolo Borzoni promises a long road ahead.

56755,Netzl 2012 Haidacker Zweigelt (Carnuntum),"An aromatic nose suggests cherries in Kirsch with vanilla, derived from the exuberant Zweigelt cherry fruit paired with the mellow spice-notes of new oak. This is rounded but remains spicy and slender at its core. A red that can be enjoyed perfectly well without food.",65.0,89,8,0.2352073812271263
110255,Obelisco Estate 2012 BDX Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"This wine—aged in a mixture of 20% new American and French oak—shows a pleasing interplay of fruit and barrel. Notes of vanilla and cocoa intermingle with dried herbs, cranberry and bell pepper. It brings focused, lightly styled but high-octane cranberry flavors that are almost creamy in feel, with the focus more on elegance than sheer power.",50.0,90,8,0.23520480294758866
88690,Fox Meadow 2010 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"Medium ruby in color, with slight bricking, the nose shows spiced raspberry notes with shades of darker brambles while sawdust and sweet baking spice tones add a bit of flair.

87546,Col Solare 2014 Component Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of barrel spice, purple fruit and herb lead to well-balanced fruit and barrel flavors.

30637,Baker & Brain 2013 Origin Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Plump strawberry and black cherry fruit provide power, but elegance is what carries this bottling, thanks to its well-integrated rose and hibiscus aromas. Cooked raspberry and ripe pomegranate notes make for a rich palate, but floral rosewater touches complete the picture. This packs punch while still being approachable in style.",65.0,94,8,0.23515377648843458
