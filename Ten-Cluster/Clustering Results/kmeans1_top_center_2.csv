0,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
4,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
7,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
13,Richard Böcking 2013 Devon Riesling (Mosel),"Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling. Off dry on the palate, yet racy and lean, it's a refreshing, easy quaffer with wide appeal.",24.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
14,Felix Lavaque 2010 Felix Malbec (Cafayate),"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
15,Gaucho Andino 2011 Winemaker Selection Malbec (Mendoza),"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
16,Pradorey 2010 Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua Single Vineyard Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino.

39,Sundance 2011 Merlot (Maule Valley),"A berry aroma comes with cola and herb notes. The palate is tangy and racy, and it delivers raspberry and plum flavors, with a modest finish.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
45,Casa Silva 2008 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot (Colchagua Valley),"This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit, with a raw feel.",22.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
67,Schmitt Söhne 2015 Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Earthy pollen and mineral notes lend a savory tone to this medium-sweet Riesling. It's soft and slightly pulpy, intensified by overripe tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Drink now through 2018.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
70,Aresti 2014 Special Release Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins.

71,Spyro 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albariño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
73,Mitolo 2016 Jester Sangiovese Rosé (McLaren Vale),"Pale copper in hue, this wine exudes passion fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers nuances of muskmelon as well. It's crisp, racy and medium in body, perfectly suited to summertime refreshment. Drink now.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

113,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak.

119,Camberley 2004 Philosophers' Stone Red (Stellenbosch),"A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.",25.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
137,Weingut Liebfrauenstift 2014 Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling.

143,Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Graciano (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.",50.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
145,Carl Graff 2014 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.",14.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
146,Casa Santa Vitória 2013 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano),"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine.

151,Conde de Velázquez 2012 Condesa Real Premium Blend Red (Aconcagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.",29.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
157,Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.",30.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
158,Fritz Haag 2014 Riesling (Mosel),"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious.

161,Stoneleigh 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",19.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
163,TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley),"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",50.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
169,Alamos 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses.

It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
171,Apaltagua 2007 Envero Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
174,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa La Joya Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery.

187,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2012 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo),"A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture.

196,Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
198,Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee),"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf.

200,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico),"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper.

205,Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate.

207,Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah.

Drink now.",20.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
212,Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
213,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia),Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
218,D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",29.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
224,J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry.

Good mass wine.",13.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
226,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",15.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
236,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region),"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry.

237,Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region),"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",18.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
241,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas.

246,Kaiken 2008 Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot Red (Mendoza),"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.",14.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
249,Mariell 2009 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion.

253,O. Fournier 2007 B Crux Red (Uco Valley),"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes.

264,Viña Cobos 2011 Marchiori Vineyard Block C2 Malbec (Perdriel),"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",215.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
266,Acústic 2010 Braó Vinyes Velles Carignan-Grenache (Montsant),"This is the stud in the Acústic stable.

269,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",70.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
270,Finca Sophenia 2011 Synthesis Malbec (Tupungato),"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power.

284,Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
287,Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley),"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.",18.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
299,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
308,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",775.0,97,2,0.9994782402321725
309,Torbreck 2012 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums.

316,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",85.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
318,Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",66.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
320,Torbreck 2012 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate.

325,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",60.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
327,De Martino 1999 Reserva de la Familia Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",10.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
337,L.A. Cetto 1996 Private Reserve Nebbiolo (Valle de Guadalupe),"The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like.

339,Lapostolle 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (Rapel Valley),"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
353,Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas.

373,Kohl 2015 Kittl Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"There is a savory, fragrant, mossy greenness that draws you in.

378,Malat 2015 Crazy Creatures Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"An earthy hint colors the pear notes which on the palate acquire a fresh, almost floral quality.

It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors.

424,Cape View 2011 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"A glimmer of toast and honey add depth to the green fig, apple and underripe peach center of this wine.

Drink through 2023.",35.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
465,Wittmann 2015 Trocken Scheurebe (Rheinhessen),"A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe—one of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones.

467,Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Made With Organic Grapes Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber.

493,Resalte 2010 Gran Resalte  (Ribera del Duero),"Welcoming aromas of wood spice, plum and blackberry become more smoky with airing. This strong-boned RDD is pure and deep, with manageable tannins.

504,Benegas 2011 Benegas Lynch La Encerrada Estate Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas.

537,Monte Xanic 2012 Viña Kristel Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Guadalupe),"Sauvignon Blanc is, in general, one of Baja's more consistent performers.

540,Proemio 2009 Gran Reserve Winemaker's Selection Red (Mendoza),"Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
543,Quinta do Portal 2012 Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc White (Douro),"Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc hangs together easily on this herb-dominant wine. The texture has a creamy character, showing green fruits, lively acidity and a bright orange-zest aftertaste.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
548,Solar de Pinheiro 2012 Paço de São Lourenço White (Vinho Verde),"With its light prickle on the tongue, this is as fresh as possible. It's clean, packed with green and citrus fruits, and boosted with some textured richness. Drink at once.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
550,Tilia 2011 Malbec (Mendoza),"Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
561,Kangarilla Road 2012 Alluvial Fans Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef.

566,Yeringberg 2013 Viognier (Yarra Valley),"This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruit—tangerine, pineapple and apricot—and gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink now–2020.",60.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
568,Marqués de Murrieta 2010 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),"Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja.

569,Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",125.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
575,Luis Duarte 2013 Monte de Carrapatelo Colheita Seleccionada Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte.

579,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo),"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",23.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
580,Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro),"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",80.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725

585,Plantagenet 2014 Riesling (Great Southern),"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.",21.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
590,Fable Mountain 2011 Night Sky Red (Coastal Region),"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
600,Rafael Cambra 2012 Soplo Garnacha Tintorera (Valencia),"Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins.

623,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",35.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
629,Saint Clair 2014 Pioneer Block 20 Dillons Point Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.",28.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
631,Kanonkop 2012 Estate Wine Pinotage (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie. The lush and decadent palate offers more of the same, with a crushed velvet texture and final notes of licorice and toasted spice that linger long. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022.",40.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725

653,Mendel 2015 Semillon (Mendoza),"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725

659,Terrazas de Los Andes 2015 Reserva Torrontés (Salta),"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.",17.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725

666,El Esteco 2015 Don David Reserve Torrontés (Calchaquí Valley),"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.",17.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
668,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe.

669,Lagarde 2013 Henry Legarde Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.",17.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
675,Ribafreixo 2015 Pato Frio Antão Vaz (Alentejo),"The grape is local to the Vidigueira region of the southern Alentejo.

676,Jacob's Creek 2015 Classic Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),"Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.",9.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
681,De Martino 2010 347 Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A little hard at first, with match stick aromas. After that blows off, there's green fruit notes carrying the nose. Full in the mouth, with acidic cut and spunky flavors of nectarine and orange. Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
683,El Coto 2010 Viura (Rioja),"Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
690,Ninquén 2009 Antu Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Cola, root beer and other earthy aromas open up this full-bodied blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Carmenère. The palate shows pointed, prickly acidity and flavors of black cherry and cassis. Offers a rich flavor profile but the acidity creates bite and sharpness.",19.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
691,Oro de Castilla 2010 Solo Verdejo (Rueda),"Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
692,Pablo del Villar 2010 Ipsum Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
696,Manyana 2008 Tempranillo (Cariñena),"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.",9.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
700,Monte da Penha 2005 Grande Reserva Red (Alentejo),"Powerful and concentrated, this is just at its peak. Ripe, rich fruit and tarry tannins give it freshness and a dry core.

711,Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro),"This mature wine has a soft, smooth character and ripe fruit. With its red-berry flavors and gentle tannins, it's very ready to drink.

712,San Pedro de Yacochuya 2012 Red (Salta),"This is a highly particular, funky blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet. It opens with savory stewy earthy aromas of berry fruits and prune. Due to the 15.5% abv, this feels heavy and clampy, with rooty flavors of baked berry fruits, cola, minty herbs and carob. An oaky spicy toasty finish with heat is the closing act on this fully stuffed Salta blend.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
713,Sobredos 2012 Aneto Tinto Red (Douro),"A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018.",12.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
716,Von Schleinitz 2015 Apollo Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Fragrant notes of tangerine and yuzu peel abound on this citrusy dry Riesling. The palate is cutting and fresh, full of juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors. Light bodied yet satisfyingly thirst quenching, it finishes long with invigorating minerality.",29.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
735,Finca Constancia 2011 Parcela 23 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded.

737,Castell 2015 Castell Silvaner (Franken),"White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith. Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish.",16.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
739,Torbreck 2013 Cuvee Juveniles Red (Barossa Valley),"Built for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries. Drink now–2022.",22.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
742,La Playa 2012 Block Selection Reserve Block N. 10 Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Earthy, lightly stewed aromas of plum and berry set up a lively but pinched and narrow palate with candied flavors of mixed red berry fruits. Additional red-fruit friendliness rolls onto the finish of this pleasant but basic Merlot.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
745,Navardia 2013 Made With Organic Grapes  (Rioja),"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
751,Terrapura 2012 Merlot (Curicó Valley),"Leathery, briny plum aromas are full and herbal. This feels solid and medium in size and body. Flavors of earthy, roasted berry and plum finish lightly green and herbal, with a touch of sweetness.",11.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

781,Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoss-Altenahr 2013 Trocken Früburgunder (Ahr),"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
782,Beresford 2014 Handpicked Grenache Rosé (McLaren Vale),"This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic—almost more of a light red than a true rosé. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
784,Carmen 2014 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins.

789,Chateau Dereszla 2014 Dry  (Tokaji),"This delicate Hungarian white wine is a blend of 86% Furmint, 9% Yellow Muscat and 5% Kabar. It has enticing aromas of white flowers, botrytis, gardenia, apple blossom and apricot that prepare your palate for flavors of peach juice, citrus zest, grapefruit juice, caramelized pineapple and a crisp clean finish.",16.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
790,Quinta do Vallado 2009 Sousão (Douro),"Sousão gives intense color and that, along with its attractive perfume, makes a dense, intensely fruity wine. It is rich and weighty, the tannins well integrated with a ripe, juicy aftertaste.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
791,Vall Llach 2007 Idus Red (Priorat),"Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.",50.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
795,Fuentes 2008 Coraje Red (Priorat),"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous.

Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.",44.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
799,Maritávora 2009 Reserva Branco White (Douro),"Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging.

805,Hungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018.",15.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
811,Morlanda 2007 Criança Red (Priorat),"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.",48.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
812,Quinta do Vallado 2010 Reserva Branco White (Douro),"A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3–4 years.",50.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
814,Bex 2014 Riesling (Nahe),"Whiffs of smoke and nuts mingle into tart tangerine and lime flavors in this refreshing off-dry Riesling. Juicy and fresh, it's a straightforward, revitalizing sip. Drink now through 2018.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
818,Casa de Vilacetinho 2013 Bruto Avesso (Vinho Verde),"A fresh lemon-flavored wine with crisp acidity balanced by warmer white-stone fruit. It is fruity, showing a touch of toast and almonds. Drink now.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
821,Antucura 2011 Grand Vin Red (Vista Flores),"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
824,Gotsa Family Wines 2014 Asureti Valley Chinuri,"Amber in color, this wine has aromas of peach jam and orange blossom. Flavors are a mélange of mellow fruit and savory notes, in particular apricot, lemon curd, quince and bitter almond. Despite strong tannins, there are moments of brightness across the entire palate that linger into the finish.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
825,Graffigna 2012 Grand Reserve Malbec (San Juan),"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
831,Falua 2015 Conde Vimioso Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Tejo),"A blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is totally crisp and refreshingly fruity.

832,Finca Sophenia 2015 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato),"Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
833,Fiuza 2015 Red (Tejo),"Known in Spain as Graciano, this grape produces attractive, fruity wine especially in the Tejo region. This example is ripe with layers of acidity as well as a generous texture. Soft and smooth, it is ready to drink.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
834,Sidewood 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
836,Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Malbec (Tupungato),"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.",175.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
839,Bodega Calle 2014 Alberti 154 Malbec (Mendoza),"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
847,Covila 2013 II Crianza  (Rioja),"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
849,Ego Bodegas 2014 Goru Verde Monastrell (Jumilla),"Cool aromas of cola, leather and black cherry set up a fairly full but fresh palate with moderate creamy weight. This tastes reedy and spicy, with wild-berry fruit, peppery notes and a distinct flavor of creamy oak. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
851,Finca del Marquesado 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
855,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Evel Tinto Red (Douro),"Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
856,Santos & Seixo 2014 Santos da Casa Tinto Red (Alentejano),"It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine. Concentrate and rich, the generous berry flavors are balanced by a more restrained acidity and smoky flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
860,Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
865,Ignacio Marín 2015 Wine Wings Garnacha Rosé (Cariñena),"Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
871,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",9.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
873,Morandé 2008 Pionero Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.",9.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
887,Byzantium 2005 Rosso di Valachia Red (Dealu Mare),"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
889,Sieber Rd 2007 Viognier (Barossa Valley),"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
891,Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",53.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
898,Yalumba 2006 Patchwork Shiraz (Barossa),"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit.

909,Nick Faldo 2005 Shiraz (Coonawarra),"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",14.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
921,Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
923,Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee),"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
928,Gaba do Xil 2012 Mencía (Valdeorras),"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",19.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
929,Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina),"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
931,Linaje Garsea 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.",28.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
932,Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
938,Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay),"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
939,Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
940,Sur de los Andes 2012 Clásico Malbec (Mendoza),"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
941,Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay),"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",70.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
942,Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza  (Rioja),"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",15.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
943,Setzer 2007 Vesper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.",20.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
949,Marqués de Vizhoja 2007 Señor da Folla Verde White (Rías Baixas),"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albariño and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
951,Finca La Emperatriz 2000 Reserva  (Rioja),"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.",30.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
953,Winzer Krems 2005 Sandgrube 13 Chremisa Zweigelt (Kremstal),"Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine,  the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now.",24.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
954,Graf Hardegg 2007 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apéritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
955,Botalcura 2006 El Delirio Reserve Syrah-Malbec Red (Central Valley),"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.",11.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725

1005,Castellroig 2010 Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"The nose falls somewhere between smoky and gritty, while dusty white-fruit scents prop things up.

1009,Condado de Oriza 2008 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.",27.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1021,Apaltagua 2014 Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley),"Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1023,Chasing Venus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish.",16.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725

1044,Fire Block 2004 Old Vine Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.",19.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

1059,Rutini 2006 Trumpeter Merlot (Mendoza),"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it.

1076,Finca Lalande 2015 Malbec (Mendoza),"Olive, saucy berry and a sense of rawness on the nose drive this Malbec towards a solid but slightly scratchy feeling palate.

1077,Altos Las Hormigas 2013 Appellation Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity.

1111,Secret Spot Wines 2014 Crooked Vines Colheita Red (Douro),"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character.

1149,Lusco 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy.

1253,TerraMater 2006 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine.

1269,Casa da Passarella 2012 Somontes Colheita Red (Dão),"This is a fruity, juicy wine that has a dry tanninc core. That gives a mineral texture to the otherwise ripe and fruity wine.

1279,Peter Mertes 2014 Platinum Riesling (Mosel),"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling.

1280,Quinta do Vallado 2013 Sousão (Douro),"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",40.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
1298,Kanonkop 2008 Paul Sauer Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
1301,Domäne Wachau 2012 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate.

1304,Judith Beck 2011 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness.

1319,Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberg Juffer Sonnenuhr Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.",56.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725
1327,Mouchão 2012 Ponte das Canas Red (Alentejo),"From the historic Herdade do Mouchão in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits.

1346,Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors.

1348,Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány),"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews.

1359,Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza),"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG.

1380,Lagar de Bezana 2010 Aluvion Gran Reserva Ensamblaje Red (Cachapoal Valley),"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee.

1547,Bodegas Cerrosol 2006 Doña Beatriz Sauvignon (Rueda),"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors.

1554,Vega de la Reina 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age.

1568,Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro),"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

1599,Niel Santofimia 2013 Red (Almansa),"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1608,Château Los Boldos 2013 Grand Reserve Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1611,Doña Isadora 2012 Carmenère (Central Valley),"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1618,Cellers Unió 2009 Roureda Llicorella Gran Selecció Vitis 60 Red (Priorat),"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors. This is fresh, wiry, firmly structured and alert as well as comfortable and controlled. Think classic Priorat to drink through 2018.",33.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
1625,Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",24.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
1633,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Terra de Lobos Tinto Red (Tejo),"The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1634,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Gewurztraminer (Duriense),"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.",20.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1637,Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava),"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",15.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1639,Mamarracho 2014 The Issue of Inexpensive Wines is When They Are Not Good Enough Red (Valencia),"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",11.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1640,Mantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",16.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1642,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Selection Branco White (Tejo),"A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",11.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1643,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Quinta de Cidrô Sauvignon Blanc (Duriense),"While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now.",20.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1644,Castillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection White (Valencia),"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",9.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1645,San Felipe 2013 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1646,Tarantas 2014 Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish.",15.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1649,Espaço Rural 2014 Alves Vieira Branco White (Alentejano),"Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",13.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1650,François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Pinot Gris Alta Colección Rosado (Uco Valley),"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this rosé of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1655,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra),"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",23.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1656,Bocopa 2012 Alcanta Crianza Red (Alicante),"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.",16.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1661,Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1663,Viña Arnáiz 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.",25.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1671,Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina),"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",25.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1672,Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",20.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1673,Eresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.",30.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1674,Montevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud),"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1675,Maximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.",9.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1678,Alamos 2013 Red (Mendoza),"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.",13.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1681,Alto Cinco 2012 Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena),"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.",15.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1682,Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",25.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
1705,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2007 Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria Baga (Beiras),"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",70.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
1719,Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès),"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",150.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
1720,Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley),"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",10.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
1723,Piattelli 2005 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",12.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
1727,Ànima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears),"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",53.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
1736,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Viognier Red (Colchagua Valley),"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1738,Errazuriz 2012 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors.",19.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1743,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau),"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap.",17.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1745,Viña Bisquertt 2011 La Joya Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1752,Shvo 2010 Chenin Blanc (Upper Galilee),"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish.",35.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1755,Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",53.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1758,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1759,Casa Rivas 2010 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley),"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.",19.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1762,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1807,Felix Solis 2013 Flirty Bird Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish.",4.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1808,Marionette 2012 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Gritty aromas of stewed berry, lemony oak, green herbs and tin set up a tannic, chewy, highly extracted palate that's lacking in elegance. Flavors of chocolate, green herbs, blueberry, vanilla and plastic finish oaky and creamy, with lasting heat.",13.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
1811,Ricominciare 2010 Malbec-Tannat (Uco Valley),"Initial plum and berry aromas fall off with airing and reveal notes of chemical and chewing gum dust. On the palate, this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Tannat is chewy, sticky and flat. Modest but sweet berry flavors veer toward molasses prior to finishing without much acidity or verve.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1812,Ricominciare 2011 Malbec-Cabernet Franc (Uco Valley),"Aromas of latex, plastic, clove and wild berry fruits try to come together. A hard, high-acid palate is narrow and choppy, with biting tannins, while a salty flavor profile that includes blackberry finishes woody and savory, with a lasting taste of clove.",20.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1821,Mureda 2012 Oak Aged Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1825,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Azul Portugal Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"Made from Castelão, the local grape of the Setúbal region, this wine is as bright and clean as possible. The light texture makes it ideal for summer drinking.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1831,Árido 2013 Sustainably Farmed Moscato (Mendoza),"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1833,Casa Rojo 2013 El Gordo del Circo Verdejo (Rueda),Melon and citrus aromas are yeasty and a bit sulfuric. This feels plump and juicy but not exact or well cut. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine turn bitter and salty on the finish.,17.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1842,Santa Alicia 2010 Anke Blend 2 Carménère-Petit Verdot-Shiraz Red (Maipo Valley),"Reedy berry aromas mixed with herbal notes set up a chunky, voluminous palate. Spicy flavors of olive, green herbs, tobacco and oak run alongside berry and plum fruit. On the finish, a resiny oak flavor and herbal notes meld then fade away. This is 55% Carmenère, 30% Petit Verdot and 15% Syrah.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1844,Mancura 2010 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot-Carmère-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Maipo Valley),"A familiar Chilean mix of berry, plum, spice and herbal aromas feed into a lifted but prickly palate that supports roasted, earthy flavors of berry, cassis and olive.

1860,Zull 2006 Beerenauslese 375ml Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Very rich in texture while also balanced, this is a wine that shows extreme concentration—honey, yellow fruits and final sugar all wrapped in lively acidity.",40.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
1861,Zull 2008 Eiswein 375ml Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Intense acidity, with the sweetness held in check by a bright, crisp character. Rich honey is balanced by an exquisite freshness, lightly perfumed, so clean and clear in final taste.",40.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
1862,Norbert Bauer 2008 Eiswein 375ml Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Both crisp and rich, a magical combination with beautiful acidity, light currants, the whole wine infused with honey. The final acidity leaves a long-lasting aftertaste.",35.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
1882,Concha y Toro 2008 Terrunyo El Triángulo Vineyard Block: 28 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1887,Marchiori & Barraud 2007 Cuartel 2 Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Perdriel),"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.",39.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1888,Morandé 2007 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback. Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",22.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1894,J. Portugal Ramos 2006 Marquês de Borba White (Alentejo),"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal. In its white manifestation, the wine is soft, very clean, with pear and cinnamon flavors, the texture just moving toward fat, but working well as a food wine.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1897,Quinta de Serrade 2006 Solar de Serrade Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),"A fine, crisp wine, with delicious green apple flavors and a tang of lime, a touch of yeast, and a dry, fresh aftertaste. There's a delicious bite to this fragrant wine.",17.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1906,De Martino 2006 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
1914,Gerovassiliou 2007 Evangelo Red (Epanomi),"Big fruit aromas of plum, raspberry and a whiff of pepper start this enjoyable red from Gerovassiliou.

1934,Bodegas Riojanas 2015 Canchales Vino Joven  (Rioja),"Rubbery raspberry and plum aromas are decent. This feels crisp and abrasive on the surface, but sort of empty in the middle. Lean snappy plum and raspberry flavors end with scratchy tannins and a medicinal aftertaste.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1936,Gorrebusto 2015  Rioja,"Candied berry aromas lack crispness. This feels hard, with little give and depth to the palate. Burnt toasted berry flavors are hot and fall off on a clumsy finish.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1941,Sonsierra 2015 Selección Tempranillo Rosé (Rioja),"This pink wine smells of red-apple skins. The palate is low on acidity but not entirely dull. Dry briny lightly bitter flavors don't show a lot of fruit, while this is pulpy on the finish.",8.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1945,Quinta da Padrela 2013 Premium Red (Douro),"The tannins are firm, still controlling the black fruits in this wine. It is concentrated, with considerable extraction giving a dry wine with a hard edge. The red-berry flavors are lost.",33.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1946,Venta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents.

1948,Bodegas Isidro Milagro 2015 SPÑ Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Prickly berry aromas include notes of both candied raspberry and cinnamon. This feels a bit clunky and sticky, with sugary berry flavors and a slightly cloying finish.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1949,Campos de Risca 2013 Estate Wine Organic Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Dusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained. This feels raw and choppy, while reedy herbal red-fruit flavors finish with a note of raisin. This Monastrell (with 10% Syrah) is okay but all over the map.",18.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1950,Casa Montes 2015 Ampakama Viognier (San Juan),"Briny, cidery aromas are a touch stale. This has a basic citrusy mouthfeel along with flavors of orange and tangerine that turn mildly bitter and pithy on the finish.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1953,Adega Mãe 2015 Pinta Negra Tinto Red (Lisboa),"This wine is ripe with red fruits and soft tannins. It is smooth, packed with red-berry flavors lifted by the acidity. Made to be drunk young, it is ready now.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1956,Lo Nuevo 2015 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Lemon and apple aromas precede a high-acid citric palate without much elegance or finesse. This pedestrian Albariño deals pithy orange flavors that come with a note of grape skins. On the finish, this seems like orange juice.",16.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
1960,Kintonis 2012 Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"Thyme and crushed herbs on the nose of this red lead into flavors of sweet spice, smoked meat and boysenberry. The wine has an exotic spin and a balanced overall character. Elegant and distinctive.",15.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1964,Malat 2016 Ried am Zaum Hefeabzug Pinot Blanc (Wachau),"The restrained nose just gives a glimpse of lemon freshness. Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine. The finish is dry and refreshing.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1969,Muga 2016 Flor de Muga Rosé (Rioja),"If you are of the school that says rosé from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence.",31.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
1972,Pratsch 2016 Ried Kittel Sauvignon Blanc (Niederösterreich),"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect.

1978,Lyrarakis 2015 Vóila Vineyard Assyrtiko (Crete),"Fresh lemon, sea salt and grapefruit aromas lead this buoyant pour from Crete.

That said, it finishes clean with a peppery finish.",16.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
1987,Casa Silva 2013 Los Lingues Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Highly herbal aromas shadow black cherry, plum, oregano and beet scents.

2007,Kim Crawford 2014 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"This is round and mouthfilling without being fat or blowsy, finishing fairly crisp and dry.

2009,Las Casas de Vacquería 2012 Sucesor Red (Maule Valley),"Herbal, spicy tomato and red-berry aromas come with oak-based coffee notes. This feels full, saucy, fresh and largely complete. The blend is Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with the wine's aromas translating to flavors of stalky berry and coffee. Spice notes and dry tannins push the finish. Drink through 2019.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2046,Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2051,Proidl 2008 Senftenberger Freiheit Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This is the lightest of the Grüners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice.

2070,Lusco 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",34.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
2071,Damalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro),"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate.

This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
2076,Casarena 2011 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture.

2079,Lingenfelder 2007 Freinsheimer Musikantenbuckel Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz),"An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish.",23.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2084,Fitz-Ritter 2006 Beerenauslese Rieslaner (Pfalz),"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.",47.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2085,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality.

2087,Vergelegen 2005 Mill Race Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch),"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red.

2093,García Figuero 2004 Tinto Figuero 15 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012.",54.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2094,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Elster Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.",27.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2111,Balduzzi 2012 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley),"This blend is green and herbal up front. Following the nose, the palate is solid and chewy, but raw.

2134,Finca Albret 2009 Crianza Red (Navarra),"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

2378,Pillitteri 2004 Fusion Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
2380,Funky Llama 2007 Tempranillo (Mendoza),"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",6.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
2393,Hesketh 2008 Usual Suspects Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",20.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2395,Borges 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão),"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",18.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2399,Antiyal 2009 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley),"Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity.

2408,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2009 Branco Cerceal (Beiras),"A wild, herbal, wood-aged wine, its acidity a fine foil to the richly perfumed fruit. Pears and sweet melon come together with the toast of the wood. At this stage, the wood dominates and needs a year to soften—then the result will be impressively food-friendly.",50.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
2409,Quinta do Cavalinho 2009 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"The aroma shines with Syrah perfumes, while the palate brings together great ripe perfumed and spiced fruit, smooth, rich and dense. There is just an earthy element that needs to soften over the next two years.",23.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
2410,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",18.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
2425,Riglos 2010 Gran Las Divas Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Tupungato),"Blackberry and cassis aromas blend seamlessly with varietal scents of herbs and leaves. This Cab Franc feels crisp yet flush, with laudable structure and vital acidity.

2434,Bodegas Muriel 2004 Viña Muriel Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy, mildly leafy aromas of dried red fruits and vanilla are textbook for Rioja gran reserva. A medium-bodied palate shows balsamic richness along with flavors of prune, raisin, cassis and loamy earth. This is mild but solid on the finish, with a quick fade to the fruit component. Drink now.",50.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2443,Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2447,Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2452,Château La Joya 2000 Estate Bottled Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins.

2453,Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",9.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2466,Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2467,Concha y Toro 2002 Xplorador Merlot (Rapel Valley),"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",7.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2472,Viña Otano 2014 Viura (Rioja),"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2484,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2014 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate.

2486,Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley),"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",11.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2491,Campellares 2014  Rioja,"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",13.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

2500,Rio Madre 2014  Rioja,"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2507,Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja),"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2508,Montes 2014 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Costa),"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2510,Rios de Chile 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2515,Valtravieso 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero),"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough.

2520,G7 2013 The 7th Generation Reserva Carmenère (Loncomilla Valley),"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725

2528,Herdade dos Machados 2009 Morgado da Canita Red (Alentejano),"This feels very ripe, perhaps overripe, with its seemingly sweet flavor of black fruit juice and its soft structure. It's appealing and does have some tannins, but it is not for aging.",5.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2530,Quinta de Gomariz 2011 Espadeiro Rosé (Vinho Verde),This is a fresh and fragrant rosé from the Vinho Verde region. It has light acidity and a red fruit flavor. The lightest prickle gives just that extra lift.,13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2543,Quinta do Portal 2011 Trevo White (Vinho Verde),"This is a lively, off-dry wine with intense acidity to accompany its crisp apple and citrus flavors. Very fruity, it's ready to drink now. Screwcap.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
2547,Bodegas Ribón 2012 Tinto Ribón Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of iodine, horse hide and saucy berry fruits are intriguing on the nose.

2559,Attis 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Dusty, leesy aromas are powdery, with little fruit character. This feels stony on the surface but not deep. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish cidery and slightly bitter.",25.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2562,Bodegas Riolanc 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja),"Unusual aromas of cardamom and cinnamon accent blueberry and plum scents.

2596,Protos 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo.

2598,Quinta do Casal Branco 2011 Falcoaria Fernão Pires (Tejo),"The fresh acidity typical of Fernão Pires is broadened by wood aging to yield a wine that has peach, apricot and green-fruit flavors, enhanced by floral aromas. There is a final, mineral texture.",15.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
2625,Losada 2013 El Pájaro Rojo Mencía (Bierzo),"Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.",18.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2630,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Album Antão Vaz (Alentejano),"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine.

2632,Pagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva  (Rioja),"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

2640,Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling.

2651,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy.

2669,Doña Paula 2009 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness.

2683,Leeuwin Estate 2003 Prelude Vineyards Cabernet Merlot (Margaret River),"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.",29.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2687,Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad.

2697,Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate.

Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate.

2751,Fillaboa 2015 Estate Grown/Viñedo Propio Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Fleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant. Briny orange and tart nectarine flavors finish plump.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2757,Lavradores de Feitoria 2014 Très Bagos Reserva Red (Douro),"This is a fruity, juicy wine with wood and bright red fruits in equal balance.

2762,Ricominciare 2010 Altísimo Malbec (Mendoza),"Cherry, cassis and root beer aromas are appealing. In the mouth, this is wall-to-wall rough due to fierce tannins. Baked berry flavors are blocky and simmer away on a rugged finish.",30.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2773,Viña Cobos 2015 Felino Malbec (Mendoza),"Earthy black-fruit aromas set up a rubbery, heavy palate with plenty of oak and related resin.

2796,Torbreck 2007 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%).

2815,Santa Ema 2007 Catalina Red (Peumo),"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",40.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2817,Cono Sur 2009 Visión Viognier (Colchagua Valley),"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made.",13.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2818,Casa Silva 2005 Microterroir de los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish.

2853,Tomero 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety.

The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish.

2894,Steininger 2015 Grand Grü Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A slightly earthy nose of yellow plum and stone fruit leads to a fresh textured palate, which shows off mirabelles and lemons. There is a pleasant phenolic edge and a clean, long finish.",30.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2895,Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Ausstich St. Laurent (Thermenregion),"The dark red fruit is enveloped in the rounded, rich and chocolaty scent of oak. The palate shows a lighter side with delicate fruit of a red-cherry nature. Freshness sumptuous oak and red-cherry notes marry well. This is lovely now, but just a few more months in bottle will allow it to knit together more. Drink now through 2020.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
2904,Bodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración  (Rioja),"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",45.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2905,Bula 2010 Red (Montsant),"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness.

2907,Can Blau 2010 Blau Red (Montsant),"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red. It's lively and a little racy and grating on the palate, with standard, fresh berry flavors touched up by a sprinkle of chocolaty oak. A modest finish keeps the vibe positive.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2910,Casa Rojo 2009 Fauno Organic Grapes Garnacha (Priorat),"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis.

2922,Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish.

2925,Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors.

2927,Oliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà),"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
2947,Matsu 2013 El Picaro  (Toro),"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
2948,Nadler 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum),"The nose here is not quite as clean-cut as it could be, while the palate shows a little more focus. Crisp and zesty, if a little short.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

2957,Companhia das Quintas 2007 Prova Régia Arinto (Bucelas),"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs. This Arinto-based wine suggests there should be some more of this ultra-crisp white, which bears a passing resemblance to a Vinho Verde in its super-fresh apple and grapefruit flavors.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2963,Turkey Flat 2005 The Turk Shiraz-Grenache-Cabernet-Mourvèdre Red (Barossa Valley),"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2964,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo),"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2967,La Posta 2006 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza),"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2974,Gemtree 2006 Uncut Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",24.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

2984,El Nido 2003 Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Jumilla),"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",42.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2985,Backsberg 2005 Pinotage (Coastal Region),"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors.

2993,Recanati 2009 Yasmin Kosher Red Red (Galilee),"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2996,Albet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Penedès),"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay.

Finishes smooth but a little flat.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
2999,Valserrano 2004  Rioja,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",45.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
3000,Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury),"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
3004,Reina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",9.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
3016,Lo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
3018,Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace),"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
3030,Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja),"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
3031,Protos 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip.

3035,Thorn Clarke 2014 Eden Trail Riesling (Eden Valley),"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022.

3037,Santos & Seixo 2013 Santos da Casa Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"This wine has fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and well-integrated acidity.

3053,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors.

It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030.",92.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
3057,Perelada 2012 Finca Malaveïna Red (Empordà),"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty.

3062,Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain),"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly.

3064,Albet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.",14.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725

3082,Pazo de Barrantes 2012 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing.

3127,Cadus 2014 Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate.

3361,Pazo Serantellos 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense.

3363,Royal Oporto 2009 Vintage  (Port),"A ripe wine from the Real Companhia Velha, this shows a rich character, its tannins ripe and generous. It's not a huge wine, but it does show a fine, full-bodied flavor of sweet plum. The final feeling is smooth and opulent.",60.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
3375,Estate Biblia Chora 2015 White (Pangeon),"he nose on this Assyrtiko blend is feisty and spicy, followed a combination of tropical fruit, citrus and vanilla spice on the palate.

3392,Elqui Wines 2013 Limited Release Carmenère (Elqui Valley),"This Elqui Syrah is topped with resiny oak aromas that emphasize clove and nutmeg.

3454,Pujanza 2009 Norte  (Rioja),"Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha.

This can be drunk now but will benefit from another 5–10 years of aging.",95.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
3467,Wine & Soul 2010 Quinta da Manoella VV Red (Douro),VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine.

3472,Fiuza 2011 Ikon Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape.

3480,S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",31.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
3495,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2009 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",84.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
3503,Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure.

3506,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta),"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous.

3508,Anciano 2003 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas.

3511,Bodegas Docampo 2008 Viña do Campo White (Ribeiro),"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",18.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

3515,El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena),"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather.

3523,Quinta da Romeira 2014 Prova Régia Arinto (Lisboa),Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.,11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
3536,Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors.

3548,Montepio 2010 Pinot Gris (San Juan),"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable.",13.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
3549,Notro 2010 Tinto Fundación Red (Mendoza),"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.",11.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
3550,Ochoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon.

3555,Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza),"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas.

3556,Caligiore 2010 Pianissimo Rosé (Mendoza),"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
3559,Solar de Urbezo 2010 Dance Del Mar Tempranillo-Merlot (Cariñena),"Sweet red plum aromas are candied and jumbled. The wine is clacky in the mouth, with a lot of acidity and narrow, sweet cherry flavors. Shows heat and burn on the finish. 50% Tempranillo-50% Merlot.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725

3567,Figaro 2009 Tinto Red (Calatayud),"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet.

3570,Lapostolle 2007 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",24.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
3572,Trapiche 2008 Broquel Bonarda (Mendoza),"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic.

Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",47.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725

3588,Spy Valley 2006 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apéritif.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
3589,Jurtschitsch 2006 Schenkenbichl Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",48.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
3601,Familia Schroeder 2006 Deseado Torrontés (Neuquén),"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",13.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725

3620,Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

3622,Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

3648,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Curicó Valley),"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar.

3650,Wine Man 2014 Mukuzani Saperavi (Kakheti),"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of cassis and strawberry.

3652,Zuccardi 2014 Q Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Aromas of oak, mint and cola accent earthy black-fruit scents in front of a palate that's tannic and raw but firm and structured. Berry and salty, oaky flavors finish with grabby, drying tannins and peppery spice.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
3653,Bouza 2013 B2 Parcela Unica Tannat (Canelones),"Ripe earthy aromas of raisin and oaky vanilla open this heavy, saturated Tannat that displays jagged tartaric acidity and heat (15.5% ABV).

3687,Antiyal 2012 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley),"Plum, cassis, floral hints and spicy, charred aromas open this Syrah-led blend. Hailing from a warm year, this feels jammy, dense and full in body.

3704,Artesana 2013 Tannat-Merlot-Zinfandel Red (Canelones),"Cherry-berry aromas are floral but also a bit furry and volatile.

4156,Genium Celler 2006 Ecològic Red (Priorat),"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive.

4159,Korta 2009 Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Lontué Valley),"A lively, surprising bargain made from Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.

Balanced and juicy, it's sure to please.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4436,Matsu 2008  Toro,"A big, burly wine that's loaded with power and fruit but is also tannic and drying. Tastes sort of raisiny and hot, with grating tannic scrub and fire in the hole. Pretty good but it doesn't have the purity, elegance and clean richness of the region's best wines.",49.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4437,Michel Torino 2009 Don David Finca La Maravilla #6 Malbec (Cafayate),"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors.

Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
4478,Grafen Neipperg 2006 Neipperger Schlossberg Auslese Traminer (Württemberg),"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",48.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4484,Drylands 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes.

4493,Mud House 2007 Swan Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style.

4496,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness.

4497,Willi Haag 2007 Brauneberger Juffer Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas.

4549,Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro),"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine.

4556,J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Smart Dog Syrah (Alentejano),"Quite why Smart Dog is a good name for a wine is a mystery.

4565,Trivento 2013 Amado Sur Torrontés-Viognier-Chardonnay White (Mendoza),"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

4578,Plantagenet 2011 Hazard Hill Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Western Australia),"This starts off with promisingly vibrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit, but seems a bit weighty and thickly textured in the mouth.

4590,Fischer 2009 Classic St. Laurent (Thermenregion),"This perfumed, juicy wine exhibts attractive red plum and blackberry flavors. Touches of herbs show a fragrant side to the wine, while acidity acts as a foil to the ripe fruits. Ready to drink now. Screwcap.",24.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

4604,Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),"There is something both earthy and berry fruited on the nose: both dried and fresh fruit shine with richness. There is a totally unusual, lovely bitter edge to this fruit, like a marzipan richness at the edge of tart but with ripe fruit.

This is dry but rich, tart but generous, and comes with its very own strong and forceful personality.",40.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725

4614,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland),"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.",47.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725

4675,Finca la Celia 2011 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley),"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made.

4677,Dr. Loosen 2009 Eiswein Riesling (Mosel),"Dr. Loosen offers a solid value in this remarkably well-priced eiswein. It's enticing on the nose, with aromas of honey, saffron and a dark, dusty mineral tone. Rich and silky in texture, it's concentrated and lively on the palate, with intense flavors of lemon and peach. Finishes with a tinge of tea and spicy orange rind.

4697,C. von Nell-Breuning 1999 Kaseler Dominikanerberg Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"At almost 16 years old, this auslese exhibits the delicate transition Riesling makes from fruit to earth.

4712,Muxagat 2011 Cisne Red (Douro),"The second vintage of this wine comes from a great Douro year. It gives structure, dark fruits and a serious tannic structure that has been rounded by wood aging.

4730,Raventós I Blanc 2012 L' Hereu Sparkling (Penedès),"Smoky, oaky aromas of popcorn and buttered toast are louder than this bubbly's citrus and white-fruit scents.

4771,Katnook Estate 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Coonawarra),"Coonawarra's not known for Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a very good example.

4773,Nice 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",30.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4777,Recuerdo 2011 Torrontés (La Rioja),"Vanilla cookies, peach and nectarine aromas work the opening. In the mouth, there's a nice and even flow of acidity and pulpy tropical fruits.

4779,Southern Right 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Walker Bay),"Hay, green plum and gooseberry lead off on the nose, while ripe hints of passion fruit and pineapple acidity flood the mouth.

4781,Sur de los Andes 2010 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Exotic on the nose, with aromas of raspberry, plum and blueberry. Shows good intensity on the palate, with a solid feel and fresh flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Fresh but smooth on the finish; very good in every way.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4782,Taltarni 2009 Three Monks Fumé Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia),"This takes a page from California in its naming convention and style, which includes a good proportion of barrel-fermentation and oak maturation. Toast and vanilla frame melon and fig notes, and the midpalate is slightly creamy in texture before the wine turns crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4784,Tormentoso 2009 Syrah-Mourvèdre (Paarl),"Black cherry and raspberry scents immediately hit you upon nosing, followed shortly after by an herbal edge with a chocolaty accent, like a thin mint cookie. This wine has structured tannins and medium weight, with a sweet-spice tinge to the close. Drink now.",13.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4785,Altocedro 2010 Reserva Malbec (La Consulta),"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors. Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.",29.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4788,Carlos Serres 2010 Serres Tempranillo-Garnacha Rosé (Rioja),"Red in color, with fresh aromas of nectarine, orange peel and red currant. For a 2010 this is still fresh and sturdy, with cleansing acidity and focused flavors of citrus and red berry fruit. Eminently drinkable, with a long finish for basic rosé. Drink immediately.",10.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

4793,Ochoa 2011 Rosado Garnacha Rosé (Navarra),"Strawberry and other red-fruit aromas run the bouquet. The palate is tangy and crisp, with dry but clean red-fruit flavors. Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

4799,Marqués de Cáceres 2011 Rosé (Rioja),"Pink in color, this has fresh, clean aromas of stone fruits. Feels medium to full, with red licorice, sweet baking-spice and raspberry flavors.

4801,Campo Viejo 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Leathery, earthy aromas don't seem entirely fresh, but they are solid and don't waiver.

It's tight, chunky and long on the finish, with tannic grab, and more tomato and herb characteristics.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
4803,Markus Huber 2011 Gelber Muskateller (Niederösterreich),"Typical aromas of spice and lychee mesh with white grape notes. The wine is attractive, ready to drink, and probably best as an apéritif. Screwcap.",25.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
4811,Stylo 2008 Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud),"With full black-cherry and bacon aromas, this affordable wine comes across well on the nose.

4820,Kurt Angerer 2014 Kies Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Spicy yeast notes rather than fruit or citrus take over and make for a light-bodied, fresh but rounded white that will be best with food, presenting savory notes that will echo any spiciness. It's a versatile, peppery white with lots of Grüner spice.",15.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
4821,Malat 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"The 2014 vintage was cool and difficult in Austria but conscientious winemakers delivered wines of incredible refreshment and verve.

4829,Umathum 2013 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"With overtones of reduction, this wine needs a lot of air at first but then proceeds to show an elegant, supple and soft Zweigelt. There are welcome edges of white pepper and very supple, soft cherry fruit, creating elegance but no heaviness. This is a very good and smooth choice to partner subtle dishes.",24.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
4831,Allram 2014 Strassertaler Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"This shows the greenish scent of conference pear peel and its juicy, tart but ripe flesh.

4850,Leonard Kreusch 2009 Estate Bottled Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheinhessen),"At less than $30, this entry-level beerenauslese is an exceptional value.

Dusty saffron and herb tones are quite pronounced on the palate, but the finish is vibrant, with hints of lemon and tangerine zest.",27.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
4854,Alma Andina 2013 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza),"Creamy aromas of vanilla cookies and melon lead to a plump palate with just enough vital acidity to keep things fresh.

4861,Rovisco Garcia 2012 Rosé (Alentejano),A caramel- and vanilla-flavored wine that has a light fruity character. There are wild strawberry flavors and a soft structure that just gives the wine some texture. Drink now.,20.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
4866,Herdade da Gâmbia 2011 Red (Península de Setúbal),"A powerful and concentrated blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Aragonez.

4869,Luis Cañas 2009 Crianza  (Rioja),"Stalky, roasted aromas lack freshness. This is scratchy and unbalanced on the tongue, with leathery black-fruit flavors that taste roasted and come with some burn. The finish is jagged and abrupt.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
4870,Basilicus 2012 Once Upon a Time White (Tokaj),"This Hungarian white has aromas of peach, apricot, citrus blossom and vanilla bean. In the mouth, there are flavors of caramelized apple and wet river rock.",19.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

4875,Casa Montes 2012 Don Baltazar Malbec (San Juan),"Stout up front, the nose is packed with black-fruit aromas. The palate feels a bit prickly and raw, while blackberry flavors run quick, with a chocolaty oak character popping up on a lean finish.",17.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4876,Casca Wines 2015 Monte Cascas Reserva White (Douro),"Viosinho and Gouveio, two classic Douro white grapes are blended in this ripe wood-aged wine.

4878,Danieli 2014 Premium Kisi (Kakheti),"Medium-gold to the eye, this wine has an interesting nose of grapefruit and coffee bean. It has flavors of pink grapefruit, almond paste, toast, vanilla and lemon curd and a slightly savory undercurrent on the palate that surges forward with notes of thyme and oregano on the finish.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4885,TintoNegro 2013 Finca La Escuela La Arena Malbec (Mendoza),"Saucy, woody aromas of plum and berry are good but strained. This smacks down with high acidity and a sense of tomato. Salty flavors of tomato, herbs, red plum and currant remain salty on the finish.",30.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4889,Viña Alicia 2008 Coleccion de Familia Nebbiolo (Luján de Cuyo),"Smoky and rustic upfront, this mature Nebbiolo smells of cherry, cassis and wet cement. In the mouth, this is a bit heavy and syrupy, with grabby tannins and an overall sticky feel. Ripe, candied berry, cocoa and oaky flavors flatten out and turn chocolaty on the finish.",64.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4891,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Red (Bairrada),"This is an attractive wine, dominated by the typical Baga grape from Bairrada. Its tannins are tamed and rounded out producing rich black fruits and fine balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2017.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4894,SignoSeis 2013 The Angel Oak Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.",30.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4896,Trapiche 2010 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.",10.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4897,Ventisquero 2009 Grey [Glacier] Single Block Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"This wine consistently scores in the upper 80s. This vintage is dealing hard spice and herbal aromas along with tight-grained oak scents. Fresh but tannic, with bite and juicy, racy flavors of berry matched by woodspice. Fades away with hickory and BBQ flavors.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4899,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2010 A Lisa Malbec (Patagonia),"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",26.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
4918,Marqués de Elciego 2009 Selección  (Rioja),"The nose on this round, medium-bodied wine is defined by sweet oak and milk chocolate. In the mouth, it's chunky and ripe, with raw tannins. Flavors of sweet, pushy berry fruits and heavy oak lead to a toasty finish with carob and wood flavors. This is good but oak-dominated.",24.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4919,Matetic 2012 Corralillo Riesling (Casablanca Valley),"Wayward aromas of tropical fruits and diesel fumes are warm and mild. The palate is plump and slightly citrusy, while flavors of white grapefruit, orange and pineapple end with pithy bitterness. On the finish, this is citrusy in flavor and pulpy in texture.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4924,Rios de Chile 2012 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"With its soft bouquet and friendly but easygoing melon and apple flavors, this ranks as a good but chunky SB with maturity and moderate oxidation already showing. It's good, tasty and easygoing, but it lacks the sizzle and snap Chilean SB is known for. Drink immediately.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4928,Vistamar 2011 Sepia Reserva Merlot (Central Valley),"This is concentrated and dark in color, with chocolaty berry and plum aromas. A full-bodied, plump and oaky palate houses milk chocolate and herbal blackberry flavors, while a healthy, driving finish with residual oak winds things down.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4934,Caliterra 2011 Tributo Single Vineyard Block #Algarrobo Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Cool-climate aromas of passion fruit, nettle, tarragon and minerality are present in this Chilean SB. It is mostly fresh in the mouth, with body and standard Leyda flavors of citrus, nectarine, green herbs and sea salt. A round, herbal finish is showing a steady pulse that won't last forever. Drink now.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
4941,Neumeister 2012 Klausen Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark),"The restrained aromatics of wet grass and gentle smoke are the only reminders that this is Sauvignon Blanc. This is lightyears removed from the pungently fragrant style that has made the variety so popular—here, it comes in a grown-up, classy guise with wonderfully judged balance and a lovely midpalate weight.",32.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4945,Astrales 2010 Christina  (Ribera del Duero),"This dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish long, with mild heat and menthol notes that suggest aging is appropriate. Drink from 2015 through 2025.",90.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4950,Arndorfer 2012 Strasser Winberge Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Hints of lemon peel rise shyly from the glass, becoming more intense with air. The palate is dry, buffered and has a savory undertow of wild thyme that interplays beautifully with sumptuous peach notes and that almost textured, zesty acidity that unites everything and brings extended, refreshing length.",28.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4952,Eichinger 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017.",30.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4954,Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",17.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4955,Hager Matthias 2012 Seeberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity. The nose and palate are round and rich, but tamed by acidity that runs through like an electric current. This rich, dry but distinctly late-harvest style wine, with just a touch of residual sugar, finishes with triumphant apple fruit and lemon zest.",32.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4957,SignoSeis 2011 The Angel Oak Reserva Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec. Drink through 2018.",60.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4958,Stadlmann 2012 Mandel-Höh Zierfandler (Thermenregion),"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler.",35.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4959,Ingrid Groiss 2012 Sauberg Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core.",47.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
4962,Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Vale das Donas White (Tejo),A soft and indistinct wine that is fat and has only the merest hint of fruit. It is round with some fresh acidity at the end.,10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4963,Santa Alicia 2014 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling. This has a snappy, grating mouthfeel and flavors of herbal blackberry and plum along with an acid-driven palate. Licorice, oak and vanilla flavors are present on the finish.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4964,Santa Luz 2014 Reserva Encinos Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Aromas of green bean, shoe polish, carob and blackberry are heavy and oaky. A creamy weight dominates the palate, which also shows an unbalanced streak of tartaric acid. Herbal blackberry, plum and licorice flavors finish minty, with a resinous oak feel.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4965,Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Herdade dos Templários Rosé (Tejo),"This is a bright pink-colored wine, with caramel as much as fruit flavors. It has a light touch of acidity that gives the wine a lift at the end.",14.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4968,Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras),"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",17.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4970,Pata Negra 2012 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
4971,Cristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre),"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric. Overall, this smells and tastes nothing like the Riesling most people know.",20.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4973,Dominio del Viento 2010 Crianza  (Rioja),"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.",16.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4974,Lomas del Valle 2014 Coastal Cool Climate Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc Rosé (Casablanca Valley),"This rosé is made from Cabernet Franc grapes, and it's briny to an extreme, with vegetal aromas. The palate is scattered in feel and lacks grace, while pickled citrus dominates the flavor profile. A mustardy, briny finish with jalapeño notes is no savior.",17.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4975,François Lurton 2013 Hermanos Lurton Verdejo (Rueda),"Seltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose. It's scattered and salty tasting, with citrus and celery notes.",18.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4976,Alto Los Romeros 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Mild citrus and grassy aromas are quiet, while this feels pithy and flat for a young wine. Tangerine and persimmon flavors are not on the money for Sauvignon Blanc, with a mildly bitter and pyrazinic finish.",9.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4978,Zerran 2013 Garnatxa Blanca Garnacha Blanca (Montsant),"Aromas of rubber and floor wax lack fruit and nuance. This has a high-acid, granular mouthfeel that lacks full cohesion. Waxy, salty flavors crowd out primary fruit flavors, while this finishes briny, high in acid and salty.",17.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4983,Terrai 2013 OVG Garnacha (Cariñena),"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",12.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4984,Bodegas Riojanas 2013 Puerta Vieja Blanco Viura (Rioja),"Wheaty and waxy on the nose, this Viura also smells of vinyl and corn. A limited palate is directed by pointed acidity, while flavors of almond skins and pithy citrus are somewhat bitter and finish with zero character.",9.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4985,Santa Ema 2014 Select Terroir Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley),"Barnyard aromas with coffee grinds and lemony blackberry are less than inviting. This feels raw, scratchy and abrasive; flavors of herbal cherry and plum turn green and weedy on the finish.",10.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4986,Trencalòs 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Chunky aromas of hay and mealy stone fruits are acceptable. This Sauvignon Blanc has a melony, creamy palate and mealy flavors of melon and papaya that match the bouquet. A yeasty, undefined finish indicates this is past its prime.",10.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4987,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2013 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.",14.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
4988,Loosen Bros. 2010 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel),"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price.

Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate.",20.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
4997,Gouguenheim Winery 2006 Blue Melosa Malbec (Mendoza),"Pure and striking from the start, with menthol aromas that come with blackberry and cassis.

5000,Jardin 2006 Cobblers Hill Red (Stellenbosch),"A Bordeaux-style blend made from 50% Cab Sauv, 30% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc and aged in new French oak for 24 months, this ripe and lush wine is ready for drinking now with easygoing black cherry and blackberry fruit aromas and flavors laced with notes of pepper, licorice root, tobacco leaf and soft leather. The creamy mouthfeel is given structure with medium tannins and balanced acidity.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5001,Laurenz V. 2010 Charming Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"The most impressive of the range of wines from Laurenz Moser V. It is tight with minerality, pepper and apple skin flavors. With a steely texture and intense youthful acidity, it's a wine that needs to age for at least 2 years. Screwcap.",30.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5004,Martino 2008 Reserva Old Vine Malbec (Agrelo),"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure.

5010,Benvenuto de la Serna 2007 Trisagio Red (Uco Valley),"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas. Stocky and firm, with nice balance and bold tannins framing flavors of lemon peel, clove, herbs, toast and berry fruit. A complete package; drink now through 2014.",28.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5015,Kumeu River 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A fresh, fruit-forward style, this wine offers bold passion fruit and gooseberry flavors with just a hint of nectarine. It's not terribly complex, but the refreshing flavors linger nicely on the finish.",19.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
5016,Michel Torino 2007 Cuma Organic Torrontés (Cafayate),"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
5020,Pillitteri 2004 Select Late Harvest Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"Intense flavors of mango, melon and apricot lead on this lively but rich dessert. The palate is bursting with flavor but layered spice softens and adds depth. The sweetness is enhanced by a pretty floral character that lingers through the finish. Imported by Wine Emporium.",24.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
5023,Luigi Bosca 2004 Gala 2 Red (Mendoza),"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.",35.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
5032,Carl Ehrhard 2008 Rudesheimer Kabinett Dry Riesling (Rheingau),"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development. It's stony and layered with honeyed citrus without being sweet, with a wiry feel to the lingering finish. Drink now.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5034,Matetic 2010 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5036,Odfjell 2009 Orzada Malbec (Lontué Valley),"Toasty, minty and sweet smelling. The palate is dark, full and choppy feeling, with cola, coconut, mint, blackberry and cassis flavors. There's good power and depth to this Malbec; a bit rough and herbal at the finish line.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5038,Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe),"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",67.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5041,Root:1 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Minerality and passion fruit aromas control the bouquet. The palate is fresh and zesty, with grapefruit, lime and green apple flavors.

5053,Viña Casablanca 2010 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Green and spunky on the nose, with light citrus aromas and nothing forced, sour or funky. The palate is full and a little creamy, with just enough acidic kick. Tastes of green melon, lime and banana. Lasting acidity provides pulse to the finish.",13.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5054,Wittmann 2009 Westhofener Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"From one of Germany's few biodynamic producers, this combines struck flint and honeyed ripeness on the nose, then offers apple, citrus and fennel-like flavors. Despite the medium body, the acids are bracing and almost sharp on the finish.",58.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5057,Chapel Hill 2006 Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale),"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs. The texture is plush and the finish long; a super value at under $20 to drink now and over the next few years.",18.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5060,Zull 2007 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Even in cooler 2007, Zull scores with this wine. It has all the right pear and apple perfumes, along with vibrant acidity and minerality. It's going to develop well over the next 4 years into a fine, elegant wine. Screwcap.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5061,Henschke 2005 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley),"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.",27.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5062,Schloss Gobelsburg 2006 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Though Grüner doesn't have a reputation in Austria for ice wine as do other varieties, based on the strength of this wine, maybe it should. It has a great balance between toffee sweetness and high acidity, the intensity softened and broadened by spice and toffee.",52.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5073,CVNE 2001 Real De Asúa  (Rioja),"Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style.

5077,Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",35.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5080,Türk 2015 Kremser Sandgrube Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear. There is a welcome grapefruit zestiness to the body and finish that makes this refreshing and moreish.",21.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5085,Township 7 2015 Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley),"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.",23.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5099,Rainer Wess 2015 Pfaffenberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Wonderfully heady hints of yuzu play about the nose.

5126,Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Spiegel Zierfandler (Thermenregion),"An unlikely but enticing mix of woodsmoke and citrus, of earthiness and lemon oil already hint at the complexity of this nutty wine. A central seam of acidity brings spicy, almost soy-sauce-like savoriness and a bruised-apple edge into focus and suggests that this is best drunk with hearty food.",40.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
5131,Tegernseerhof 2012 Bergdistel Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Aloe vera, green pear peel and ripe Mirabelle plums charm nose and palate on the soft and ripe palate. Despite the ripeness nothing is overdone and reaches a center of gravity.",30.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
5132,TeHo 2012 Malbec (Mendoza),"Blackberry, blueberry and creamy vanilla aromas comprise a sweet, chunky, very ripe bouquet.

5133,Jäger 2012 Federspiel Selection Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Conference pear and lemony acidity produce a clean-cut mouthfeel and real refreshment factor. The wine is concentrated but also is lean and soaring, supported by stony minerality.",27.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
5144,Bründlmayer 2015 Langenloiser Rosé (Niederösterreich),"Notes of tart strawberry and wood sorrel rise delicately from the glass and scent the light, softly hued palate beautifully. There is interest here beyond mere fruit and the spicy core mingles beautifully with ripe lemon freshness. Drink soon but slowly to savor the spice.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5164,The Dot 2015 Austrian Pepper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Very ripe, juicy pear notes emanate from the glass, but there is also a friendly tinge of yeast. The palate does both notions complete justice, delivering a refreshing but supple, peppery mouthful with a lovely, moreish and lip-smacking finish.",13.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
5179,Cramele Recas 2013 Conocul Ambrozy Sauvignon Blanc (Recas),"This late harvest Sauvignon Blanc is honey gold in color, with tantalizing aromas of honeysuckle, white flowers and lanolin. It is generous on the palate, with flavors of apricot and tinned peaches supported by floral notes. Its sweetness is enhanced by a pleasing level of acidity on the finish.",28.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
5204,Fat Gaucho 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Leafy, spicy, dry berry aromas lead to a jacked up, edgy palate with hard, scraping tannins. Forced woodspice and raw plum flavors finish more spicy than fruity.",13.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5205,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2013 Chento Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp and furry on the nose, this is all tannins and scratch. High acidity only contributes to the grating mouthfeel, hence it's a bumpy ride where standard berry flavors are a sideshow. Chento 2012 is a better bet if it's still on the shelf.",20.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5208,Bodegas Valdemar 2015 Conde Valdemar Rosé (Rioja),"Crushed vitamin-like minerality dominates the nose, which also brings a sketchy, aroma of pumpkin innards. A wide palate is lacking in shape, while flavors of citrus and squash finish weakly.",13.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5215,Arzuaga 2014 La Planta  (Ribera del Duero),"A strange blend of earthy, mulchy berry aromas along with notes of wet cement and Nestlé's Nesquik are hardly impressive. This feels clumsy, with heavy, sticky tannins. Stewy berry flavors and chocolaty oak notes finish as if this was loaded up with cocoa powder.",19.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5216,Figaro 2013 Tinto Red (Calatayud),"Horsey berry and vinegar aromas lack freshness and appeal. This feels both tight and dilute, while flavors of forced oak, tomato and tart berry fruits finish drawing and bitter.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5217,Region 1 2014 Malbec (Mendoza),"Earthy cherry and prune aromas lack pop and seem damp. This is astringent across the palate, with flavors of prune and oaky vanilla. A raisiny, mealy finish is choppy and exits with the aftertaste of prune.",8.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5225,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2013 Serras de Azeitão Seleção do Enólogo Branco White (Península de Setúbal),"A wine that is so soft, its texture only just brushes the palate.

5226,Borges 2013 Quinta da Soalheira Branco White (Douro),"Apricots and peaches dominate this fresh and lively wine. It is ripe and crisp with a herbal texture. Full of up-front fruit, it can be drunk now, with its lightly perfumed aftertaste.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5227,Quevedo 2013 Oscar's Branco White (Douro),"Earthy, youthful aromas lead to a wine that's ripe while still finding its fruity character. The potential for the citrus and apricot flavors is there and should develop by mid-2015.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5228,Real Compañia de Vinos 2013 Rosado (Spain),"This rusty-looking rosé smells rustic, with cherry and raspberry notes. In the mouth, it registers as full-bodied, while the flavor profile is chunky and dry, with early signs of oxidation that are confirmed on a low-steam finish. Drink right away.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5230,Dominio de Eguren 2013 Protocolo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Lime, melon and citrus aromas are basic but clean. The palate is pulpy in feel, while pithy flavors of white grapefruit and generic citrus fruits finish with a mild note of papaya.",7.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5232,Caves Transmontanas 2010 Vértice Cuvée Reserva Brut Sparkling (Douro),"There is a curious petrol aroma to this wine.

5233,Epilogo 2013 Sauvignon Blanc-Moscatel White (La Mancha),"Tropical-fruit aromas highlight the Moscatel in this blend. The palate is plump and melony in feel, with melon, peach and lychee flavors. The finish is soft and doesn't show a lot of acidity or cut.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5234,Finca Flichman 2013 Misterio Malbec (Mendoza),"Aromas are leafy and scratchy, also suggesting cement. This feels resiny and creamy in the mouth. Flavors of woody, generic berry fruits finish hot and scratchy.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5236,Pittacum 2013 Tres Obispos Mencía Rosado (Bierzo),"Aromas of generic red fruits and children's vitamins are the greeting. This is chunky in feel, with light acidity that tries to keep things from coming across cloying. Candied flavors could use more dryness and elegance, while the finish is sweet and tastes of brown sugar and berry syrup.",23.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
5237,Tilia 2013 Torrontés (Mendoza),"Generic, slightly soapy tropical fruit and cured-meat aromas smell oily. This is not flabby, with soft flavors of melon, papaya and lychee. A mild finish with some bitterness doesn't offer much snap or zest.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725

5241,Bodega Atamisque 2013 Serbal Viognier (Tupungato),"This smells flowery but also flabby and oily. The palate has a creamy, tropical feel to it and flavors of melon, papaya and powdered sugar.

5244,Poças 2016 Coroa d'Ouro Branco White (Douro),"This is a ripe yellow fruit and mango-flavored wine. It is all fruit, rich and deliciously refreshing. The 10% of Moscatel in the blend has had an enormous effect on the perfumed character of the wine. At the end, the acidity keeps it fruity and crisp.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5245,Quinta de Porrais 2016 Sete Vales Branco White (Douro),"Grown in high-elevation vineyards at 1,800 feet, this crisp white is a blend of five of the familiar Douro varieties, emphasizing brightness as well as soft fruitiness.

5246,Quinta do Pôpa 2015 Contos da Terra Red (Douro),"The wine is juicy and rich. Its soft texture comes from fermentation in tanks that recycle CO2 to give a gentle extraction. The result is rounded, smooth, full of black fruits and with plenty of crisp acidity to finish.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5261,Boas Quintas 2016 Fonte do Ouro Encruzado (Dão),A short wood-aging has given this rich wine a creamy smooth character. That balances with the ripe yellow and tropical fruits that are cut with acidity. It is still a young wine and will certainly be better from 2018.,19.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5262,Borges 2013 Reserva Tinto Red (Dão),"Aged for two years in wood, this ripe wine is rich and structured. It has the firm tannins and minerality typical of the Dão while also having balanced fruit and acidity. It is firm, although ripe, and ready to drink.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5263,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Palha Canas Red (Lisboa),"Light wood aging over six months has given this wine a polished character.

5264,Cave Geisse 2014 Brut Sparkling (Pinto Bandeira),"Pear, apple and wet-stone aromas are tight, while this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir feels citrusy, high in acidity and chalky. Green apple and orange flavors finish stony and crisp.",36.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
5286,Maquis 2014 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Oaky foresty berry aromas are mildly damp and woodsy, with coffee and herbal notes. This feels full but also clamping and tight.

5290,Peter Mertes 2015 Platinum Riesling (Mosel),"Subtle minerality lends surprising elegance to this otherwise buoyantly fruity wine.

5297,Gotas de Mar 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"The integrated nose with peach, melon and stony aromas is clean and vital.

5301,Dr. Volkmar 2015 Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Dusty, smoky saffron and pollen complexities accent sunny white grapefruit notes in this racy, light-footed kabinett.

5302,VinEcol 2009 Malbec (Mendoza),"This wine defines overripe but palatable Malbec. The nose is raisiny and heavy, but not very powerful.

5303,Origin 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well.",11.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725

5313,2 Copas 2009 Red (Mendoza),"Smells like wet dog, with sweaty red fruit. The palate is high in acid and low in volume, with snappy, semisour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Settles on the finish but still it's sharp and lean. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Malbec.",8.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725

5744,Ngumu 2015 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"A hint of lightly toasted brioche adds depth to the red apple and honeydew fruit aromas and flavors.

5745,Bodega Las Cañitas 2009 Familia Navarro Torrre Grand Gold Medal Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Argentina),"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity.

5746,Zorzal 2016 Terroir Único Pinot Noir Rosé (Tupungato),"This copper-tinted rosé of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits.

5750,Indaba 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"This easy-to-like wine is loaded with forward citrus tones alongside additional scents of gooseberry and fresh grass.

5752,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2007 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"A fruity wine that is packed with red cherry and juicy plums. On top of the fruitiness, however, the acidity is prominent, which means it needs time to fill out, leaving a smoky, leathery textured aftertaste. Glass stopper.",22.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
5753,Hafner 2002 Essencia Kosher Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Burgenland),"A sweet, toffee-flavored wine, the super-rich Riesling bringing some good acidity into the mix of intense concentration and ultra-sweet honey.

5756,Stone Paddock 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"Perhaps this is starting to tire?

5775,Numanthia 2009 Termanthia  (Toro),"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.",200.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
5798,Inniskillin 2008 Ice Wine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of freshly pressed apple, wildflower honey and tangerine peel, this is a richly textured, almost creamy, ice wine.

5820,Zerran 2014 Red (Montsant),"Charred, malty, foxy, herbal aromas sound the alarm. This Garnacha-Carignan blend is rough as sandpaper, with heavily oaked flavors of herbaceous black fruits. A rough and rugged finish is abrasive.",18.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5823,Altos de Cristimil 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Chunky pithy stone-fruit and citrus aromas are sketchy, while the palate is tangy and none too pleasant. Flavors of mealy citrus fruits and a finish with the consistency of orange juice do nothing to help this along.",20.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
5824,Marques Escriba 2013 Monastrell-Tempranillo Red (Jumilla),"Wiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish.",10.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
5828,Marqués de Vargas 2013 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero),"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar.

5831,Roncão 2012 Quinta da Levandeira Reserva Red (Douro),"This wine is woody, showing concentrated toast and vanilla flavors. It seems to be missing its fruit.",20.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725

5835,Trencalòs 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Light in color, sketchy on the nose and dilute on the palate, all of which means this has discernible issues.

5836,Josep Grau Viticultor 2015 L'Efecte Volador Red (Montsant),"Hot rubbery untamed aromas need help. This Syrah-led blend feels clampy and rough. Salty murky black-fruit flavors are herbal and wild, and there's no help coming on the finish, which is grabby.",15.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
5837,Via Revolucionaria 2015 Pura Bonarda (Mendoza),"The intent here seems to be a low-alcohol “pure” expression of Bonarda. But with volatile high-toned cherry and raspberry aromas along with a narrow scouring palate, this comes across as tart and lean. Sour herbal red-plum flavors are raw on the finish.",15.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
5838,Altos de Torona 2013 Barrica Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Oxidized apricot aromas comprise the bulk of the nose on this weird oak-aged Albariño.

5839,Finca Vieja 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (La Mancha),"There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5848,Gladium 2009 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",15.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5851,Santa Quiteria 2010 Altitud 1.100 Garnacha Tintorera Alicante Bouschet (Almansa),"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
5852,Bodegas Navarro López 2009 Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents.

5868,Viña Casablanca 2013 Cefiro Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Tarry, rubbery cherry and chocolate aromas turn towards olive as this breathes. Raw, rubbery and mildly astringent in feel, this tastes like plum and tomato with herbs and salt.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
5872,Falernia 2014 Reserva Viognier (Elqui Valley),"This Viognier from the outlands region of Elqui is minerally but low on fruit aromas.

5873,Viña La Fortuna 2013 Ventura Reserve Malbec (Lontué Valley),"Earthy, scratchy berry, plum and spice aromas are inviting on the nose. This is bold, acidic and a touch sharp in feel, with generic black-fruit flavors as well as toasty oak and spice. A fresh finish with leftover notes of blackberry winds things down.",16.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
5874,Vistamar 2013 Sepia Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley),"This Malbec opens with a blast of raw woodgrain, a lactic smell, leather and finally some black fruit.

5878,Sierra Batuco 2015 Reserva Pinot Grigio (Maule Valley),A pink-meets-tan color is the greeting on this peachy Pinot Grigio that smells like fresh applesauce. A spunky palate of stone fruit and moderate acidity deals additional notes of waxy melon.,12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
5882,Concha y Toro 2013 Marques de Casa Concha Merlot (Maule Valley),"Wiry, scratchy blueberry and black-currant aromas come with an odd soapy perfume.

5884,Intipalka 2013 Valle del Sol Tannat (Ica),"Aromas of freshly laid asphalt and char-grilled hamburger shroud herbal berry aromas. This Tannat is chunky on the palate, but low on structure.

5885,Lobster Reef 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This lightweight wine combines herbal notes reminiscent of tomato and celery leaves with hints of white grapefruit. Finishes just a bit short, with vaguely peppery notes.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
5887,Millaman 2014 Estate Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Bell pepper and citrus aromas are limited in scope. The palate feels acidic, with quick-hitting flavors of green herbs, bell pepper and tropical fruits.

5913,Valle Frio 2004 Reserva Merlot-Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Maule Valley),"Oaky and a little spotty, with aromas of cheese, cinnamon and wood resin sitting heavily on herbal, traditional fruit. The acidity is bracing, so there's a lemony bite to the palate along with flavors of raisin, raspberry and cherry. A fairly good blend of Merlot, Carmenère and Cabernet, but one that's missing a few parts.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
5916,La Playa 2007 Block Selection Limari Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley),"Light peach aromas mix with a hint of sea breeze to give this wine a subtle approach.

5918,Mount Nelson 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"On the leaner side, with mineral overtones to the grapefruit and cut-grass aromas and flavors. Comes out of the bottle with some smelly reductive notes that take some aeration to eliminate, so decant before serving.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
5924,Seven Terraces 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Pungent grassy aromas vie with passion fruit on the nose, while the flavors lean more toward the tropical fruit side of things.

5943,TintoNegro 2010 Finca la Escuela Estate Grown Altamira Malbec (Mendoza),"This extremely dark-colored Malbec offers mellow blueberry and blackberry aromas.

5944,Altavins 2009 Tempus Red (Terra Alta),"Jammy aromas of baked blackberry and plum are fiery at first and then flatten out with airing.

5948,Cava Aragon 2011 Madera 5 Nebbiolo (San Vicente),"While this is fiery on the nose, you also get attractive, complex aromas of baked cherry, brandied plum, leather, coffee and chocolate. The flavor profile consists of red berry, chocolaty oak and spice, and things conclude with savory, roasted flavors cut by lasting acidity.

In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away.

6142,Cave Spring 2014 Cabernet Franc (Niagara Escarpment),"Cab Franc makes a strong case for being top gun among this region's reds. This estate-grown example has been vinified for aromatics, elegance, balance and detail, and succeeds beautifully. Juicy boysenberry and blueberry fruit is buoyed with ample acidity.

6145,Dr. Leimbrock 2015 Graacher Himmelreich Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),"Candle wax and pollen notes lend a slightly earthy tone to fresh lemon and lime in this off-dry Riesling.

The palate has the same fresh pear notes as well as that textural element of peel. Bone dry, it comes with finest fizz and is utterly refreshing, if rustic. It would shine as a full-flavored picnic wine, with a lastingly dry finish.",28.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
6148,Goose Bay 2015 Kosher Sauvignon Blanc (South Island),"There's more to this wine than just citrus and grass. On the nose it's floral and nutty, with a hint of ginger.

6155,Studert-Prüm 2016 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Delicate crushed mineral and lemon aromas turn riper and fruitier on the palate.

6161,Mogollon 2012 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Charred and rugged on the nose, with gamy cherry and plum aromas, this feels narrow and clampy.

6162,Von Der Leyen 2014 Riesling (Nahe),"While the nose is subdued, the palate of this off-dry Riesling is unexpectedly fruity, brimming with juicy peach and nectarine flavors. It's simple and straightforward but a refreshing, satisfying sip. Drink now through 2017.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

6184,Viu Manent 2011 Viu 1 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Smoky, roasted aromas of blackberry, cassis and graphite introduce a thick, layered, meaty palate that's well balanced despite being overtly ripe and generous.

6204,Quinta da Rede 2012 Reserva Red (Douro),"French oak aging has given this still-young wine a firmly structured character, with dark tannins and a firm texture. It's still very dry, structured and dark and needs a good few years to age and round out. For now, the ripe fruit and acidity are both showing great promise.

6205,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2012 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"Quinta Nova has produced two Grand Reservas in 2012.

6210,Wine & Soul 2012 Pintas Character Red (Douro),"This is the second wine from the Pintas vineyard in the heart of the Pinhão valley. It's powered by mint, dark plums and new wood flavors to give a richly concentrated, juicy wine.

6212,Herdade das Servas 2011 Reserva Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano),"Alicante Bouschet, a grape that has red juice as well as skins, produces rich and darkly colored wines. This wood-aged Reserva is a concentrated and tannic example. It's also ripe and full-bodied, a bold wine that packs a big punch. The wood aging shows well, reinforcing the fresher black juiciness of the wine. Drink from 2017.",40.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6213,Henschke 2007 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley),"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish.",30.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725

6216,Mitchelton 2002 Print Shiraz (Central Victoria),"Not quite as impressive as some other vintages, the 2002 Print Shiraz boasts plenty of color but lacks some nuance and freshness.

6219,Pfeffingen 2007 Ungsteiner Herrenberg Spätlese Scheurebe (Pfalz),"Fans of this sometimes kinky grape variety will probably feel this rating is too low. This wine starts of with hints of Scheurebe's wild side, offering up hints of something resembling Sauvignon Blanc, then adding almost tropical fruit and currant and pink grapefruit flavors tinged with just enough residual sugar for balance. A wild ride, but an enjoyable one.",30.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
6224,J.L. Wolf 2006 Wachenheimer Belz Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz),"At first, this Riesling looks sort of bland and troubled—the aromas are nondescript, the mouthfeel broad.

6227,Fitz-Ritter 2006 Dürkheimer Michelsberg Grosses Gewächs Riesling (Pfalz),"This “great growth” is richly concentrated, even a bit syrupy in texture, although almost totally dry in style.

6245,Aveleda 2015 Casal Garcia Red (Douro),"While the familiar white version of this wine is from Vinho Verde, the producers have gone a little further south to the Douro for the red.

6251,Chilensis 2015 Reserva Estate Bottled Malbec (Maule Valley),"Charred oak aromas settle on creamy, with a note of plastic to go with heavy spice and secondary berry scents.

6252,Clairault 2016 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River),"On the riper spectrum rather than youthful and fresh, this shows wet wool, ripe lemons and stone fruit, with a hint of green beans and florals. The palate is backed by searing acidity and a slightly woolly texture. Rather simple in style but it clearly shows the characters of both the Sauvignon Blanc and the Sémillon.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

6305,Markus Molitor 2008 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",30.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6307,Campelo 2014 Casal da Seara White (Vinho Verde),"With a light prickle on the tongue, this is a fresh and fruity wine that has sweetness balanced by a citric edge. It's crisp and ready to drink.",6.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6308,Cartuxa 2014 Vinea Tinto Red (Alentejano),"Made to be drunk young, this is a fruity red berry flavored wine. It has a bright crisp edge to its fruit as well as light tannins and acidity. It is quite ready to drink.",7.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6310,Septima 2014 Malbec (Mendoza),"Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.",14.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725

6318,Aljibes 2014 VA Viña Aljibes Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft.

6319,Baron De Ley 2014 White (Rioja),"Leesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness. The palate is regular in feel, with adequate acidity.

6322,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2014 Senses Alvarinho (Alentejano),"A tropical fruit flavored wine with yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. It is soft and very ripe although still showing some of the fresher acidity that should be in an Alvarinho wine. It's a long way from the cool north of Portugal.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6323,Castro Martin 2013 Family Estate Selection Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity.

6324,Vieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms.

6325,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Companhia das Lezírias Tyto Alba Vinhas Protegidas Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo),"This wine shows the tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc with pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity is there, floral and ripe. The wine is ready to drink now.",23.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6327,Paso a Paso 2014 White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6328,Herdade do Rocim 2014 Mariana Rosé (Alentejano),"Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez, it is full of ripe raspberry and red plum flavors that are soft and generous, although lacking acidity. Drink now.",14.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6330,Egeo 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6333,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Monta da Baía Red (Península de Setúbal),"With some earthy, rustic flavors the wine seems to have missed out on some of its fruit. It is more about structure and firm tannins with only hints of juicy fruit behind.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6337,Gimenez Riili 2007 Perpetuum Torrontés (La Rioja),"From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.",14.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6338,Achaval-Ferrer 2007 Malbec (Mendoza),"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",29.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6348,Tamaya 2007 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley),"Edgy, nervy and funky, with unfamiliar aromas and flavors. The nose is pickled and the palate is tart, linear and green. Loses itself as it opens, turning more herbal, sweaty and strange.

6351,Tamaya 2007 Pink Goat Rosé (Limarí Valley),"Chunky, dark and muddled, with flavors of cooked rhubarb and hard spice. Seems thick on the palate and pickled on the finish. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",13.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
6352,Bodega Don Bosco 2007 Torrontés (Maipú),"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts. It's not awful but it's the kind of wine that does nothing but fall apart once the cork is pulled.",7.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
6353,Finca El Origen 2007 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley),"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",18.0,80,2,0.9994782402321725
6354,Pascual Toso 2007 Torrontés (Maipú),"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch.",12.0,80,2,0.9994782402321725
6355,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2008 Los Vascos Rosé (Colchagua Valley),"Having liked the 2007 rosé from Los Vascos, this pickled, citric burner just doesn't cut it. It shows Sauvignon Blanc-like flavors and acidity, while the finish is sour and briney. Devoid of the charm and pleasantries that rosé should deliver.",12.0,80,2,0.9994782402321725
6357,Cockburn's 2009 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"Fresh and perfumed, this wine has fine acidity along with bright berry flavors. The freshness suggests it is still young and needs to broaden out with its juicy, black currant aftertaste. In style it is dry, balance by a bright final acidity.",25.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6358,Cyatho 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),"Grapefruit and stony aromas grace the nose in front of a lightly spritzy palate. Flavors of mixed tropical fruits show notes of bell pepper and white pepper dust, while nectarine and grapefruit flavors drive the finish.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

6370,Vivanco 2012 Colección Vivanco 4 Varietales Tempranillo-Graciano-Garnacha-Mazuelo  (Rioja),"A grapy, meaty, feral nose is wild, floral and herbal as a whole. This blend of Tempranillo and other Rioja varieties is tannic along its walls. Saucy, grapy, salty flavors are powerful, while the finish is tannic, voluminous and once again grapy like the nose and palate.",75.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6373,Bodegas Landaluce 2014 White (Rioja),"Mild applesauce aromas are reticent but clean. This feels fresh, stony, acidic and narrow on the palate.

6374,Burrowing Owl 2011 Meritage (Okanagan Valley),"This wine plays out broadly across the palate, showing tart berries and espresso components, along with a whiff of asparagus.

6375,François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Alta Colección Pinot Gris (Valle de Uco),"Peach, pear, melon and vanilla aromas come with an aromatic sensation of wet rocks.

6380,Herdade do Esporão 2010 4 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano),"A blend of typical Alentejo grapes, this is a firm effort, with the fruit laced inbetween the complex tannic structure. The acidity gives the wine a final lift.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6381,Chilcas 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish.",13.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6384,Ventisquero 2011 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Minearally and fresh on the nose, with hints of grass, lime and apple.

6392,Cono Sur 2009 Grapes Organically Grown Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
6395,Château Musar 2004 Cuvée Rouge Red (Bekaa Valley),"An appealing nose of blackberry, plum and cinnamon gives this Lebanese red a sturdy start.

6398,Anakena 2010 Indo Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"Green and vegetal in aromas and flavors. The nose deals pea, green bean and asparagus tempered by lime and melon.

6399,Red Guitar 2006 Old Vine Garnacha Rosé (Navarra),"This new consumer-friendly brand sports a Garnacha-based rosado and a red blend. The rosé is a bit sweet and mass-market in style, but it has nice color, mouthfeel and integrity. With detectable residual sugar, it's probably better if you have previously enjoyed blush wines.

6408,Durigutti 2011 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"Tightly wound aromas of rubber and black fruits preview a rubbery, fruity palate that's generous in its delivery of vanilla, creamy berry, black plum and cassis flavors.

6411,Fire Road 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers. Hints of tomato leaf garnish passion fruit and citrus flavors in this wine, which reveals a certain amount of austerity and restraint on the palate, a silky texture and a long, grapefruit-driven finish.",14.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725

6414,Montespina 2013 Verdejo (Rueda),"Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors.

6423,Vinyes del Terrer 2010 Terrer d'Aubert Red (Tarragona),"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",40.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6433,Greywacke 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs.

6447,Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberger Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),Demure lemon and lime on the nose turn fleshy and ripe on the palate of this delicately sweet Kabinett.

6494,Garcia Schwaderer 2012 Bravado Red (Itata Valley),"Deep purple in color, this Itata Valley blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha is concentrated, cool and rubbery smelling, with underlying cassis and blackberry aromas.

6501,Arboleda 2013 Carmenère (Aconcagua Valley),"Peppery berry aromas show a balsamic nature. This feels fully oaked and resiny, while bold, fruity flavors of ripe black grapes, plum and peppercorn finish with a wave of heavy oak and mint.",25.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
6505,Davino 2010 Purpura Valahica Feteasca Neagra (Dealu Mare),"This indigenous Romanian variety is made into a dark ruby colored wine with aromas cigar box and farm stand that are only slightly reinforced by cherry notes.

6511,Stapleton & Springer 2007 Roucí Red (Moravia),"This red blend has a nose of fresh cherry, red plum and clove. In the mouth, it offers a combination of fruit and spice flavors featuring anise, black plum, Chinese five spice, and black cherry.

6553,Señorío de Sarria 2005 Vino Dulce Natural Moscatel (Navarra),"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",18.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725

6560,Barkan 2005 16 Months Barrel Aged Kosher Tempranillo (Samson),"Though a touch green on the nose, that's countered by plenty of wood and vanilla. Hints of plum, faded cherry and licorice appear in the mouth, with a sweet, cedary finish. Drink now.",22.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
6561,Valsanzo 2005 Vall Sanzo  (Ribera del Duero),"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",13.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
6567,Eleusis 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",19.0,80,2,0.9994782402321725
6575,Leth 2012 Steinagrund Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"Pear-scented, this supple white delivers straight down the line without any annoying frills. The wine is balanced, clean and comes with poised acidity.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6576,Maior de Mendoza 2012 Argos Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Melon, peach, leesy vanilla and mineral aromas are what you want from this type of wine. The palate is juicy and fresh, with nectarine, orange and pineapple flavors. A racy finish is confirmation of this Albariño's zesty character.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6581,Paso a Paso 2012 Estate Bottled Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Robust black-fruit aromas suggest plum and blackberry. This everyday red is concentrated, generous and packed with power. Flavors of dark berry fruits, chocolate and espresso finish with verve and clarity.",9.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6589,Trapiche 2012 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza),"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.",10.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6596,Zarate 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"This shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6601,Finca Albret 2007 La Viña de Mi Madre Reserva Red (Navarra),"Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry. It's long and supple late, and it's arguably one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons you'll find from Spain and Navarra.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6603,Jean Daneel 2010 Signature Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"This oaked Chenin shows great structure and power now, with the potential to cellar nicely for another three years or beyond. Toasted brioche, wood-grilled peaches and quince aromas open up immediately on the bouquet and carry through to the palate alongside seductive accents of sweet spice, almond skin and orange oil. The texture is round and full, and the spice-driven finish is long and satisfying.",28.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6607,Kirchmayr 1992 Solist Riesling (Kamptal),"This has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy. It is a delicious wine that has been aged in cask before bottling.",75.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6611,Rabl 2010 Schenkenbichl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Delicious and full bodied, this has both weight and delicacy. It is rich and dry, with swathes of ripe apricot and pineapple that cut through the tense acidity. A wine for aging over 5–6 years. Screwcap.",34.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6612,Ken Forrester 2009 T Noble Late Harvest Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"A stunning and inviting dessert wine that exhibits the superb balance that Chenin Blanc can lend to the style. Honeyed peach and apricot notes abound, with spicy accents of ginger, clove-spiked orange and toast. The mouth is lush and slightly viscous, but the racy acidity provides good cut. This ends with a long, spice-driven finish. Delicious now, but it should age for another five years.",55.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6613,Maurodos 2007 San Román  (Toro),"Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, café mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.",70.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6620,Clarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon),"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.",75.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6624,Cellers Sant Rafel 2005 Solpost Red (Montsant),"A winner given its quality-to-price quotient. This smells earthy, dark and harmonious, with black plum and berry aromas leading the charge. It feels racy, juicy and full, with giant raspberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors. It's textured on the finish, with bright, lasting flavors. Drink now.",23.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6642,Dão Sul 2006 Cortello Touriga Nacional (Estremadura),"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",7.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6646,Marqués de Cáceres 2005 Crianza  (Rioja),"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6649,Scala Dei 2006 Negre Red (Priorat),"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6653,Plaisir De Merle 1998 Merlot (Paarl),"Mature fruit is veneered with oak and kissed with dusty cocoa and dry earth. Although this is losing freshness, it comes off as elegant and the tannins suggest that it may age for just a year or two longer.",22.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6656,Havana Hills 1999 Shiraz (Western Cape),"Approachable, fresh flavors of red plum, toast, tobacco and apple peels finish with a cedary zing. The body of this wine is lightweight, with good acids and particulate tannins with a fair grip.",33.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6658,Thelema 1999 Merlot (Stellenbosch),"Damp, foresty earth aromas meet those of cherry and dusty cocoa, which carry to the palate of lightweight red fruit. The balance of smooth tannins and gentle acidity is pleasant, but there is room for more heft and complexity overall in this wine.",22.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6659,Mas Nicolas 2000 Cape Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"This wine has a thin streak of eucalyptus throughout. As a foil to that green note, there is red licorice, cassis, sweet cherry and blk plum to entice. Pleasant notes of molasses, oiled leather and white pepper round out the palate.",34.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6663,New World 2002 Syrah (Western Cape),"This wine seems to reach out to the mainstream: flavors and aromas of sweet vanilla, cinnamon toast and brown sugar are met with lightweight red fruit, a soft balance and just a touch of white pepper. Inoffensive on all counts, but lacks the depth needed to set it apart.",10.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6664,Niel Joubert 2000 African Tradition Collection - Elephant Shiraz (Paarl),"The balance of this wine has slightly spritzy acidity in the lead, wrapped with sheer tannins. Rich aromas of earth, leather and toast are contrasted by the bright fruit which is a sweet candylike strawberry-cherry at the forepalate.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6668,Torres 2002 Viña Sol White (Penedès),"Pine needle, lilac and some musk on the nose. Citrus is the driving force from then on. There's tangerine and some melon for flavor, and plenty or orange and passion fruit on the finish. A drink-now citrus ball that's full and flavorful.",10.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6670,Ken Forrester 2001 Merlot (Stellenbosch),"The acidity is in the forefront, with little structure or fruit to fill it out. The fruit displays notes of milk chocolate, red plum and fresh herbs. The toast and oakspice ride nicely on the clean finish.",20.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6674,Omaka Springs 2002 Riesling (Marlborough),"An eccentric version of Marlborough Riesling that tastes reminiscent of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with a green, underripe quality and some goosberry aromas on the nose. There's also a hint of riper, cinnamon-scented fruit and a clean, crisp finish.",15.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6677,Bodegas Concavins 2000 Proyecto 4 Red (Conca de Barberà),"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6678,Viña Maipo 2015 Gran Devoción Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of match stick and green herbs don't deliver much fruit. This feels round and regular, with grassy flavors along with hints of green bean and canned pea. Unresolved pyrazines on the finish result in an herbal, green flavor.",18.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6684,Clos Pons 2015 Jan Petit Red (Costers del Segre),"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha. A hard, grabby palate holds flavors of herbal plum and grape skins, while an obtuse finish tastes a little green.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6686,Cuyen 2016 Merlot (Central Valley),"Minty berry aromas settle well and hold up to airing. This everyday Merlot is more than competent on the palate. Berry and spice flavors finish chewy, with standard ripeness and follow through.",10.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6691,J. Bouchon 2016 Canto Sur Red (Maule Valley),"With Carmenère and País in the blend along with Carignan, this shows a lot of “old country” character, namely a saucy, savory nose with herbal red-berry hints. Herbal plum and peppery flavors fade on an undistinguished finish.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6692,TerraNoble 2013 Reserva Terroir La Higuera Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Heavy aromas of herbal berry fruits and wood smoke are rustic. This wine feels resiny and edgy, while saucy, oaky flavors of pancetta and tomato finish with notes of sausage, fennel and bacon.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6710,Septima 2006 Tempranillo (Mendoza),"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6717,Celler La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta),"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",19.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6722,Funky Llama 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",6.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6728,LaStella 2013 Moscato d'Osoyoos Moscato (Okanagan Valley),"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect apéritif or brunch wine.",20.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6732,Andeluna 2012 Pasionado Malbec (Tupungato),"Cool, earthy, rooty aromas of licorice, Graham cracker, cassis and blackberry are dark and brooding. This Malbec is loosely structured, with heavy extraction and blackened, gritty flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, rubbery, blocky finish is giant like the rest of the wine. Drink through 2022.",62.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6734,Bodega Catena Zapata 2011 Nicolas Catena Zapata Red (Mendoza),"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.",135.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6736,Cave Spring 2012 CSV Estate Bottled Riesling (Beamsville Bench),"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.",25.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6742,Quinta das Carvalhas 2012 Reserva Red (Douro),"This is an initially smooth wood-aged wine that is intense, concentrated and packed with power and tannins. It is rich and full of brooding dark plum and dense with structure. Dominated by Touriga Nacional, it has that variety's perfumed character which is balanced by the smoother Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz. It is obviously a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",25.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6752,Starborough 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The quality here has been consistent over the past few vintages, offering solid value in an easy-drinking style. It leads with herbal aromas, but the flavors are less green, more melon and fig carried by a sense of creamy lushness. Drink now.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6764,Juan Gil 2007 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6765,Juan Gil 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla),"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6766,Montes 2009 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Big, chunky, rubbery and loud, but also poised and fruity. The palate is fierce and full, with some scratch but also very lush and ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Fruity to the max, with a chocolaty finish. A massive wine for $12.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6771,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 Catarina White (Península de Setúbal),"Rich, smooth, with great wafts of creaminess to go with a judicious amount of toast. White plum and pear flavors precede a finish with impressive concentration and delicious acidity.",12.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
6772,Bodegas Mähler-Besse 2005 Taja Excelecia Red (Jumilla),"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",23.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
6774,Wines & Winemakers 2009 Touquinheiras White (Vinho Verde),"From the far north of the Vinho Verde region, the rich and creamy wine balances acidity, green plum and crisp minerality. Aromatic, elegant, fresh.",17.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6775,Ànima Negra 2007 ÀN/2 Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears),"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6782,Byzantium 2005 Rosso di Valachia Red (Dealu Mare),"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6783,Chrysorroyiatissa 2008 Ayios Andronicos White (Cyprus),"An alluring nose of apples, flowers and citrus lead this delicate white from Cyprus. Pretty, unfolding flavors of apple, flowers and citrus are backed by good acidity and a touch of spice.",17.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6786,Yali 2009 Wetland Winemaker's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),"Opens with honest green notes of gooseberry, lime and sea foam, and while the palate is a touch soft in texture, it has true Chilean SB flavors of bell pepper, fresh lettuce and melon. Sturdy on the finish, with a forward attitude.",8.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6791,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Elements of this thick, ripe, almost late-harvest SB succeed. The palate is creamy and layered, and it works that angle to its advantage. By the same token, it's flat and won't last for much longer, and the finish is pithy and borderline cloying. Drink right away.",19.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6795,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Amethystos Sauvignon Blanc (Drama),"This sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc sets itself apart with its rich nose of nuts, vanilla and flowers, followed by pretty flavors of spice and white flowers and fruit. Acidity balances the fruit. A fuller-bodied style that can handle richer seafood dishes.",22.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6797,Heavenly Retreat 2007 Riesling (Recas),"This poised white offers aromas of honeysuckle, pear and flowers, and on the palate, curvy flavors of spice, apples and pear. Charming—serve chilled with cheese, dessert.",8.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6798,Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Dark and baked, with hickory, leather and prune/black plum aromas that are slightly herbal and roasted. The palate has a tight, solid feel but presents savory, baked flavors of plum and soy sauce. Salty liked cured meat on the roasted finish.",13.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6801,Protopapas 2008 Traminer (Pageon),"This slightly sweet white starts with a lush nose of flowers, orange marmalade and spice, followed by floral flavors edged with spice and minerals. Not overly complex, but paired with grilled fish or squid, a unique and tasty sip.",18.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6806,Morandé 2002 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"The nose is like citrus candy and applesauce, but it doesn't sing or pop like it could. The mouth is easygoing, with melon and grapefruit, but there's also a bit of unwelcome green bean. This wine fails to excite. —M.S. .",7.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6808,Casa Rivas 2001 Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Tight and oaky in the nose, with some funky green notes. The palate is a bit herbal and mildly vegetal, but there's also some cherry fruit and spice. The texture on the finish is the high point, but the vegetal flavor at the wine's core is a sore point.",6.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6815,Calama 2001 Merlot (Casablanca Valley),"Briar patch, some green pepper and a little sweet baking spice carry the nose. The plum and berry flavors are accented by brown sugar and caramel, but also some green characteristics. The finish is smooth, but too green.",9.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6819,Quinta da Romeira 2001 Estate Bottled Arinto (Bucelas),"Light and simple, with green apple and citrus aromas and flavors. Use it to wash down steamed shellfish at the beach.",7.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6820,L.A. Cetto 1999 Petite Sirah (Valle de Guadalupe),"Dark and earthy, slightly pruny and alcoholic, finishing on notes of tar and molasses.",8.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
6823,Vino de Eyzaguirre 2001 San Francisco de Mostazal Reserva Especial Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Early aromas of sea water, mushroom and rubber integrate into a more pleasant whole. The flavors are sweet and candied, while on the finish a mild vegetal hint comes on. That said, the wine is decent in the mouth, where the texture is pleasant.",8.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
6830,North 42 Degrees 2016 Sweet Riesling (Lake Erie North Shore),"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6833,Township 7 2014 Rock Pocket Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley),"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.",28.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6842,Indaba 2016 Mosaic Red (Western Cape),"This Bordeaux-style red blend, made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, opens with pleasant herbal tones of green pepper, blackcurrant leaf, plum skin and tobacco leaf. Black fruit flavors abound on the solidly structured palate, finishing with hits of milk chocolate and charred earth.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

6850,Viña Bujanda 2010 Tinto  (Rioja),"Bouncy, jumpy, candied aromas come with scratchiness and minty green. Feels tangy and bordering on sheer, with zesty flavors of red berry fruits, citrus and herbs. Mild and not too deep on the finish.",12.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6852,Zarate 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6856,Château Tanunda 2010 Grand Barossa Riesling (Barossa),"Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in Australian Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp. Perhaps it will blossom with age, but for now it is simply intensely citrusy and rather skinny. Pair it with oysters, or put it in a cool dark place and hope for the best.",16.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6864,J. Garcia Carrion 2010 Opera Prima Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Shows dark fruit aromas and raisin on the nose, feels fresh, zesty and edgy, with a bright mix of cherry, berry and mild spice flavors. Feels pretty good and offers a reasonably solid and long finish for a $6 red.",6.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
6870,Argyros 2013 Assyrtiko (Santorini),"Sea salt and lemon rind start this refreshing white. Flavors of citrus, mineral and brine on the finish are balanced and bright. A lovely wine and a great pairing for grilled octopus, sushi or poultry.",28.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6871,Castellroig 2009 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Toasty aromas include popcorn, scrambled egg and briny white fruits. There's smoothness to the ripe palate, while apple, peach and citrus flavors—the Big Three of cava—finish fruity and with stuffing. This is a ripe winner that's richer and more flavorful than your average brut nature.",35.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6873,Thymiopoulos 2012 Young Vines Xinomavro (Naoussa),"Raspberry, spicebox and cinnamon aromas start this modern-style Xinomavro. Lively acidity and a good tannic structure balance the cherry fruit. A great introduction to the variety.",17.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6876,Mano A Mano 2011 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"It's almost absurd how good this $9 Tempranillo is. Full, clean, deep aromas of black fruits and licorice feed into an energetic yet generous palate with moderate richness. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry and pepper finish spicy but not pushy. What a deal!",9.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6883,Finca La Mata 2011  Ribera del Duero,"Loamy, earthy blackberry and plum aromas are woody and attractive. This is loud and lively on the palate, with acidity and tannins making their presence felt. Blackberry and baked plum are the key flavors, and this finishes loamy and smooth. Drink through 2018.",22.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
6885,Mulderbosch 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Notes of grass, green pepper and citrus on the nose are followed by a combination of steely minerality and plump grapefruit on the palate in this sophisticated wine. Zippy but substantial, it will pair well with foods like oysters or grilled fish.",21.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
6892,Valsanzo 2005 Viña Sanzo Tempranillo (Rueda),"For a basic Tempranillo from Rueda, there's nothing not to like about this wine. It's snappy and fresh, maybe a bit sharp, but not spiky. The flavors are of berry and cherry, and the feel is tight but solid, with some juicy depth. Drink it like you might Beaujolais.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6895,Southern Right 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Walker Bay),"A perfect summer wine, this Sauvignon Blanc offers a combination of cheerful citrus and fruit and a flinty minerality that keep it dry and clean on the palate. Paired with seafood, it's even better.",17.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6897,Pago de Larrainzar 2005 Red (Navarra),"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend. However, in the mouth the wine is more expressive and ripe, with plum, berry and ample oak-driven vanilla. It doesn't appear to have much depth or complexity, but overall it is smooth and pleasant.",56.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6898,Pago de los Capellanes 2006 Joven Roble  (Ribera del Duero),"Fairly ripe and deep smelling, yet it's more racy and lean in the mouth. There's good berry fruit to this Tempranillo-led wine, but it turns kind of sharp and sheering on the back palate. Freshness and snappy zest are the wine's main characteristics. Probably best with tapas.",19.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6899,Vergelegen 2004 Merlot (Stellenbosch),"A rich, stately nose announces the elegance of this Merlot from the consistently poised Vergelegen.

6900,Viña Albali 1998 Gran Reserva de Familia Red (Valdepeñas),"This blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is light and leafy but not dirty or harsh. It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit. For something aged and mild, it's pretty good but not what you'd call substantial. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6904,Old Well House 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"This Sauvignon Blanc offers more weight and earthiness for fans of whites that steer away from lean, grassy flavors.

6907,Beau Joubert 2006 Oak Lane Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"You can't beat the price of this simple, quaffable red from Oak Lane, and certainly this is a wine that could make for very nice everyday sipping.

6909,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2003 Rioja Bordón Crianza  (Rioja),"Pretty nice for a lean, more traditional Rioja crianza.

It's old-school, so don't look for a lot of color, body or sweetness.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6910,Bodegas Leza García 2001 Arderius Reserva  (Rioja),"The nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute. The mouth offers standard plum and berry flavors, while the mouthfeel is chunky and generally quite pure. This is not a thoroughbred, but it's more than a good plow horse.",28.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
6913,Campolargo 2014 Campolargo Branco White (Bairrada),"A barrel-fermented wine, this is richly perfumed both from the wood and from the nature of the Cercial grape.

6929,Von Schleinitz 2015 Nitor Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Wisps of smoke and honeycomb thread enticingly amidst fresh lemon and lime in this nimble-footed dry Riesling.

6936,Messias 2012 Quinta do Valdoeiro Colheita Red (Bairrada),"This is a solidly tannic wine. A dry edge comes from the Baga grape in the blend. At the same time, the wine has plenty of ripe black fruits that give a rounder character. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2017.",17.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
6944,Markus Huber 2016 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"The nose is very shy, giving little away apart from slight citrus. Everything happens on the palate, with tender but ripe pear fruit gently edged with zesty citrus. A tingle of white pepper along the lemon peel creates a vividly fresh but light wine.

6959,Stift Klosterneuburg 2015 Blaufränkisch (Thermenregion),"Fruity hints of blueberry pie on the nose are juicy, ripe and enticing.

6961,Türk 2016 Kremser Weinberge Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Both tropical and herbal notes join the citrus flavors on the nose, hinting of passion fruit as well as mint.

6968,Laughing Stock 2011 LFNG Blind Trust Red (Okanagan Valley),"Essentially a Bordeaux-style blend (just 4% Syrah breaks the mold), this smooth, silky wine is seductive.

6969,Leth 2013 Scheiben Roter Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"Grassy hints mingle with riper yellow pear notions.

6971,Markus Huber 2013 Berg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Very soft notions of ripe, yellow pear with floral overtones create a softer, luscious but completely dry palate.

6974,D'Arenberg 2010 The Blind Tiger Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This wine starts off a bit tarry at first, with scents of asphalt and roasted meat that then give way to brighter notes of blackberry and vanilla.

6982,Alzinger 2013 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"This is still closed tightly and barely wants to give away more than punchy grapefruit zest, but the balanced palate that cushions the fresh but ripe acidity suggests that this will open up gradually. Drink as of 2017.",75.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6983,Anton Bauer 2013 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram),"Subtle but unmistakable white pepper flashes through this slender, lemony but oh-so-savory wine. Notions of ripe pear enter on the midpalate which comes across as complete, harmonious and long.",33.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
6984,Arndorfer 2012 Die Leidenschaft Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),"Savory hints of bay and an inviting, lively pepperiness lend verve to this cherry-laden red.

7010,Grant Burge 1999 Miamba Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"A young wine, dark purple in color, whose aromas are dominated now by oak. The sweet, sappy vanilla scents mask the grapes, but not in the mouth, where jammy berry fruit is powerfully ripe. Fortunately, the wine is dry, with lively acids. —S.H.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
7012,Coto de Imaz 1994 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"This lighter-styled, mature Rioja shows just a hint of brown at the edges.

7018,Hollick 1998 Wilgha Shiraz (Coonawarra),"It seems as if the emphasis is more on the oak than on the fruit. But the oak is darn tasty—toasty, vanillin and bringing all sorts of dried-spice complexities to the table. The wine is creamy and full enough to support the oak, even if the cherry-berry flavors do take a back seat. —J.C.",34.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
7019,Hollick 1999 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast),"At 93% Shiraz, many wineries would have just labeled it as Shiraz, but not Hollick.

7025,Craneford 2000 Quartet Red (Barossa Valley),"This kitchen-sink blend boasts a high percentage of Petit Verdot (38%), which may account for its dramatic floral aromatics.

The palate reveals more intrigue, with pure lemon zest and aromatic inflections of crushed citrus foliage.

The finish is long, lip-smacking, totally refreshing and fruitful.",49.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7443,Jäger 2015 Steinriegl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"The rather closed nose gives little away. The palate, however, is full of juicy stone fruit. Think ripe mirabelle and apricot, think juicy tangerine and orange. This is full of fruit and tension, highlighted with lemon freshness and a lovely streamlined taut palate. The long finish has something of fresh apples about it.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7448,R&A; Pfaffl 2015 Hundsleiten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"Flint and yeast vie with each other to give the first impression of this rich wine.

7450,Salomon-Undhof 2015 Von Stein Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"An almost tropical touch of pineapple and passion fruit hovers over the glass. This is testament to the ripe 2015 vintage. The palate, however, reins in this fruity generosity with fresh, zesty notes of citrus, adding also a counterweight of textured phenolics. There is structure despite all the ripeness and ample refreshment, almost some grippiness. The zesty finish is very moreish.",45.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7452,Steininger 2015 Loisium Weingarten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),Generously ripe notions of yellow plum and juicy pear fill the nose. The palate benefits from the same fruitfulness but adds a touch of pepper and herbal savor at its concentrated core. There is something joyful about this. Despite the generous fruit this stays streamlined and supercrisp. The finish focuses on that wonderfully spicy pepperiness.,25.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7466,Anakena 2012 Late Harvest Viognier (Cachapoal Valley),"Dusty, smooth aromas of spiced apple are easy to like. This is sticky, with just enough acidity to maintain freshness.

7471,Viña Casablanca 2013 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Grassy aromas blend with tropical fruit notes to create a good but regular Casablanca bouquet.

7496,Espiritu de Chile 2014 Reserva Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Overt oak and black-fruit aromas are spicy, with an emphasis on clove. This feels wide and blocky, with abrasive tannins. Generic berry flavors are good but oaky, while the finish offers more of the same.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725

7502,Livius 2009  Rioja,"Lazy raisiny aromas reflect a very warm vintage. In the mouth, this Graciano is fat, with dense, plodding tannins. Raisin and prune flavors are chewy and exceedingly ripe, while this is obtuse on the finish.",75.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
7522,Elias Mora 2012 Crianza  (Toro),"Toasty, warm, lusty dark-berry aromas are laced with a subtle animal accent. This is a big wine, with a fleshy, tannic, muscular feel.

7524,Errazuriz 2013 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Earthy black-olive and foresty herbal scents accent core blackberry and moss aromas.

7525,Vega Sicilia 2007 Unico  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great. A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024.",450.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7528,Peter Jakob Kühn 2014 Jacobus Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate.

7535,Covila 2010 Pagos de Labarca  (Rioja),"Covila produces mostly good-quality affordable Rioja wines, but with this bottling the winery has stepped it up a notch. Aromas of raisin, graphite, prune, vanilla and coconut are ripe and oaky. A chunky, blocky, ripe palate holds blackberry and cassis flavors that come with notes of dried herbs. Chewy tannins and peppery spice push a bold finish. Drink through 2022.",31.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
7538,Brancott 2014 Flight Song Pinot Grigio (Marlborough),"This low-alcohol offering exhibits less weight and richness as a result. Still, it's a pleasant, lean white that relies on lemony flavors to provide crisp refreshment.",16.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
7540,Stonecrop 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough),"A respectable effort, this offers attractive aromas of fig, melon and nectarine, but doesn't follow through with much intensity on the palate.

7543,Lomas del Valle 2013 Coastal Cool Climate Single Vineyard Merlot (Casablanca Valley),"Combine a cool year with cool-climate, single-vineyard origins and the result is this: olive, bell pepper and saucy tomato aromas, followed by a pointy, high-acid palate that's jagged in feel.

7555,Falernia 2013 Pedriscal Vineyard Reserva Carmenère (Elqui Valley),"Murky, mulchy aromas of baked black fruits and coffee grinds set up a gritty, hard palate of barrel char and roasted berry fruits.

7558,Balduzzi 2010 B Red (Maule Valley),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend is a green machine with a pyrazine-led explosion of green bean and bell pepper aromas. Robust and grabby on the palate, this tastes heavily of herbal plum and canned green bean, while a minty finish includes flavors of olive and bitterness. This feels right but smells and tastes extremely green.",39.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
7571,Trapiche 2008 Gran Medalla Malbec (Mendoza),"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas.

7573,Caves Aliança 2007 Quinta das Baceladas Red (Bairrada),"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend.

7574,Cielo y Tierra 2007 Don Juan Nahuel Malbec (Mendoza),"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry.

7577,Clos Gebrat 2010 Red (Priorat),"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction.

7578,Ochoa 2010 Vino Dulce Moscatel (Navarra),"This smells like orange marmalade.

7595,Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe),"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",67.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
7597,MontGras 2010 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Shines with a nice purple lustre then opens with big blackberry and spiced plum flavors that are earthy and wild.

7598,Peter Jakob Kühn 2009 Landgeflecht Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"A largely unfruity wine, defined by mineral notes of struck flint and crushed stone.

7603,Dr. Loosen 2009 Red Slate Dry Riesling (Mosel),"It's labeled dry, but this wine comes across as just slightly off dry, with ripe melons and pears taking the lead and never looking back. It's plump on the palate, finishing with a teasing sense of sugar. Drink now.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
7605,Fitz-Ritter 2009 Dürkheimer Rittergarten Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"If there's any quibble with this wine, it's that the aromas and flavors remain in a very narrow range, from struck flint to citrus. Otherwise, it's a lovely dry Riesling, slightly plump and custardy on the palate yet crisp and sharply focused on the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",22.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

7661,Cousiño-Macul 2015 Isidora Sauvignon Gris (Maule Valley),"This varietal Sauvignon Gris isn't as aromatic as the more pungent Sauvignon Blanc.

7676,Jurtschitsch 2015 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"A very slight citrus lift, edged with ripe pineapple, on the nose announces a precise palate of lusciously ripe flavors: sun-ripened yellow mirabelle plums nestle alongside ripe oranges and clementimes.

7697,CARM 2006 Quinta do Coa Red (Douro),"The minerality that seems to come from this quinta makes for a wine that needs time, and this wine is defiantly young. However, its chocolate flavors, bitter toast and dense structure all promise well.",26.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
7699,The Lane 2006 Estate Grown Viognier (Adelaide Hills),"This doesn't have the sheer breadth of many Australian Viogniers, but it offers more structure and length on the palate.

7771,Gunter Triebaumer 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Very ripe and sumptuous notes of blueberry pie make for an appetizing proposition.

7779,Laurenz V. 2015 Singing Laurenz V. und Sophie Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Fresh, pliable, slightly pear and apple scented and dry—what's not to like?

7795,Casa Marin 2007 Laurel Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"A little bulky and maybe just beginning to fade. This is a rounder and chunkier specimen than the 2008 Cipreses SB, and it shows softness at its core and hints of green bean and bell pepper. Fortunately, holdover acids and green-fruit notes bring it back to higher ground. Drink immediatelyor wait for the release of the '08 vintage.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
7806,Huber 2005 Hecklinger Schlossberg R Trocken Spätburgunder (Baden),"Of the various Huber Pinot Noirs, this is the one most in need of 2–3 years of cellaring. Some pungent cabbage and cedar aromas should be better integrated by then, and the firm tannins now evident on the finish should also be at least partially resolved. Right now, there's a hint of silkiness and some nice plum and sous-bois notes that should only improve over the short term.",104.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
7811,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
7847,Errazuriz 2011 The Blend Collection Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Tarry, briary, gritty aromas take some getting used to.

7862,Pujanza 2010 Norte  (Rioja),"Powdery, perfumed aromas of raspberry and red plum announce a palate with ringing acidity. Plum, red currant and strawberry flavors come with moderate loamy weight, while the finish takes on an earthy quality that's balanced by shearing, tangy acidity.

7879,Linaje Garsea 2009 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Concentrated, compact aromas of black fruits are generous but also monotonous and low on character. A big, bulky palate is round but offers enough acidic kick to keep everything above water. Baked, flat flavors of black fruits and roasted meat finish smooth but low on pulse.

7919,F X Pichler 2016 Ried Burgstall Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"On the surface there is brisk, spicy grapefruit zest, while underneath the nose hints at generously ripe apricot and Mirabelle plum. The palate plays off juicy stone fruit and zesty citrus on a sleek, slender, concentrated body. The freshness is brisk and taut, while the fruit is charming and soft. With a slender, sleek and dry mouthfeel, this is just what you want from Riesling.",38.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
7922,Garmón 2014  Ribera del Duero,"This dark, concentrated number is new from the García family, known for the wines of San Román and Mauro.

7939,Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Red (Douro),"The estate is owned by the Olazabal family, descendants of Antonia Ferreira who created this and many other estates in the 19th century. This is a major wine, ripe and full of rich tannins and concentrated fruit. It is always one of the longest-lived wines from the Douro and this vintage has the structure and the fruit weight to develop well. An attractive spicy, smoky character adds extra interest.

7946,Pascual Toso 2014 Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"If you love massive Argentine reds with purity of fruit and fine oak, then this blend is up your alley. Toasty blackberry aromas come with plenty of oak grain, vanilla and depth.

7952,Dr. Loosen 2014 Erdener Prälat Gold Capsule Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dulcet peach, apricot and citrus sweetness extends languorously from nose to finish in this powerfully ripe, hedonistic wine. It's dancing and delicate in frame, yet unctuously juicy, filling the mouth with a blanket of luminous fruit. Sprightly tangerine acidity and delicate tea-leaf tannins lend structure to a long, penetrating finish. It's irresistible already but should continue to drink well for decades.",114.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
7958,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2014 Vinha da Francisca Red (Douro),"Always impressive, this wine is structured and powerful, with firm tannins that are still coming together. Packed with black fruits and tannins, it conveys a rich, almost Port-like quality, perhaps because the grapes are foot-trodden as in Port. Drink this wine from 2022.",100.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
7989,Quinta do Passadouro 2005 Red (Douro),"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years.",20.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725

8007,Coriole 2005 Lloyd Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors.

8065,Artadi 2012 El Carretil  (Rioja),"Jammy, concentrated aromas of boysenberry, violet petal and oak spice are about as rich and lusty as Rioja gets.

8075,Bodega Aconquija 2005 Alberto Furque Syrah (Uco Valley),"Earthy and meaty, with aromas of dark cherry, plum and a whiff of volatility. Once things settle, it evolves into a full and flowing, semigeneric red with earnest grape and blackberry flavors along with cola. While it's hard to peg this as varietal Syrah, it's well made, balanced and full. Good for folks who like full-bodied wines.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8077,Ramos-Pinto 2003 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"Firm and dry, this LBV from a fine Port year is structured, showing dry tannins as well as ripe, dry fruits.

The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.",57.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8158,Bodega Norton 2007 Privada Red (Mendoza),"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8159,Tamar Ridge 2007 Kayena Vineyard Pinot Gris (Tasmania),An extra year has added some depth here. Lemon and apricot fruit are layered over almonds and macadamia on the nose while a hint of jasmine adds interest to the palate. The medium finish offers up an intriguing nuttiness. Best before 2012.,22.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8160,Vrede en Lust 2009 Jess Rosé (Simonsberg-Paarl),"With its juicy, citrus, melon and strawberry aromas and flavors, this dry rosé is mouthwatering and a food winner.

8161,Valentin Bianchi 2009 Sensual Malbec (Mendoza),"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.",10.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8162,Vaza 2006 Crianza  (Rioja),"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
8165,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Mariana Tinto Red (Alentejano),"There is a rich blend of Aragonez, Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Syrah in this full, ripe, black-fruit tinged wine.

8184,Cortes de Cima 2012 Aragonez (Alentejano),"A bold, rich wine fringed with tannins, at a young age it already shows a solid structure of ripe and juicy berry tones. With well-balanced oak aging, slightly toasty notes show restraint on this dark and complex wine that has potential to age. Drink after 2016.",24.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
8187,Maquis 2010 Lien Red (Colchagua Valley),"This racy, fresh, cool-vintage blend is a touch rubbery on the nose, with berry and cassis undertones. A tight palate delivers a mix of dark plum, blackberry, baking spice and chocolate flavors in front of a peppery, dry, crisp finish. Drink through 2019.",30.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
8188,Quinta Seara d'Ordens 2010 Reserva Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro),"This is a powerful wood-aged wine that is currently exhibiting dark chocolate and coffee flavors from new, smoky oak. It's the weight of the juicy fruit underneath that reveals the promise of aging. There is a mineral texture that shows the schist soil of the vineyard, all part of the dense mix. Drink from 2018.",59.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
8190,Familia Deicas 2004 Preludio Barrel Select Lote N 77 Red (Juanico),"This mature Bordeaux-style blend is earthy on the nose, with tobacco, clay and loamy berry aromas. Despite its age, the palate is still showing red-fruit acidity matched against ripeness and weight. A mix of dried berry, tomato, tobacco, spice and salty flavors finish loamy and smooth. Drink now.",45.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
8191,Cono Sur 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"On the nose, this smells like bath soap or air freshener. It feels fleshy and oily on the palate, with tropical flavors of banana and papaya. The finish is smooth and tastes of candy.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8193,Chilcas 2010 Single Vineyard País (Maule Valley),"The nose bears lightly green aromas of stalky cherry and raspberry. It feels grabby on the palate, with peppery, dry flavors that come up short in terms of fruit content. The finish is spicy, rustic and unwavering.",18.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8194,Targovishte 2011 Premium Quality Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Black Sea Coastal),"Grassy with green leaf and fresh-cut herb notes, this dry, easy-drinking wine boasts lively lime-juice acidity and pleasant apple flavor.

8195,Korta Katarina 2010 Plavac Mali and Zinfandel Rosé (Peljesac),"The lavors of candied red cherry and flower are pleasant, but dusty herb notes distract on the nose and palate. It's a big wine at 13.9% abv, but zesty acidity keeps it relatively balanced.",21.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8200,Arauco 2011 Reserva Pinot Grigio (Central Valley),"Minerally and neutral on the nose, this tastes fresh and crisp like a green apple, with dry flavors of white fruit and bitter almond. It retains that almond character on the finish, which turns even drier and more bitter.",14.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8201,Casas del Toqui 2011 Merlot (Central Valley),"This is raspy and rough on the nose, with heavy mint, green herb, latex and bell pepper aromas. It feels fairly full, with herb and peppery berry flavors, leading to a green, minty, scratchy finish.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8202,Root:1 2010 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"The leather and earthy plum aromas in this wine come with a strong, stalky component. It tastes big and syrupy, with the roasted flavors that the nose anticipates. The finish is baked tasting, with a gritty feel and a mild green accent.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8203,Villaggio Grando 2011 Brut Sparkling (Santa Catarina),This opens with dusty dried-apple aromas. High acidity preserves its composure even though the fruit is marginal and vacillates between flavors of apple and lemony citrus.,31.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8204,Viña Chocalan 2011 Selección Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"For wine drinkers who don't mind briny aromas, here is a wine with a funky-oyster quality on the nose. This adequate wine tastes of orange, brine, asparagus and pickled beans. It's juicy and plump on the tail end.",12.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8206,oops 2011 Red (Central Valley),"Crusty on the nose, this has an asphalt note that transitions into hard spice and sour berry notes. It has flavors of creamy, minty oak and medicinal berry fruit. A lasting flavor of oak-driven spice and a hint of green carry some heat.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8214,El Nido 2011 Clio Red (Jumilla),"Monastrell (with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon) has rarely smelled this perfumed, rich and inviting. This is an ultraripe Levante bruiser, with a jammy yet defined structure and huge flavors of baked blackberry, exotic spice, dusty mineral and toasty oak. Herbs, espresso and toast flavors propel this rich red to a lush finish. Drink through 2017.",45.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8221,Prinz Salm 2012 Kirchberg Bingen Trocken GG Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Freesia and tangerine rind scent this bright, aromatic wine. It's dry in style, yet luscious and ripe, streaked with tones of honey tangerines and peach. Bristling lime acidity lends cut and vibe to the finish.",69.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8242,Castillo Clavijo 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",19.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8243,O. Fournier 2009 Urban Ribera  (Ribera del Duero),"Generic berry and plum aromas come with sweet vanilla notes and a briney pinch. The wine feels fresh but clacky, with juicy acids giving drive to standard dark cherry and berry flavors. Peppery and lightly oaked on the finish.",14.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8250,Chono 2009 Reserva Syrah (Elqui Valley),"Opens with an aromatic blast of graphite, peppery spice and rubber along with meaty black-fruit scents. Feels round and a bit wayward, with middling fruit, peppery accents and moderate sweetness. Finishes heavy and condensed, with jamminess.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8253,Falua 2010 Conde de Vimioso Colheita Seleccionada White (Tejo),"A soft apple-tinged wine, with bright acidity that cuts right through. The wine is rounded, with just enough crispness. Ready to drink.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8255,Viña Bisquertt 2010 La Joya Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Dark on the nose, with peppery spice, mocha, basil and secondary berry aromas. Shows power and density in the mouth, with burnt, blackened flavors of blackberry, plum and pepper. Even more peppery on the finish. More black and dark than typically herbal and spicy.",11.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8260,Lapostolle 2010 Casa Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Fresh and colorful, with black cherry, cassis, sweet oak and coffee aromas.

8265,Naia 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),"Clean mineral, saline, blanched almond and white-fruit aromas announce that this wine is still fresh and not losing a step just yet. Flavors of white peach, apricot, pineapple and green apple are pleasant, while the mildly pithy finish is short but cleansing. Drink now.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8267,Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Chenin Blanc (Robertson),"Satisfying melon and refreshing citrus give this enticing wine subtance and spirit. Crisp apple adds to the clean, fruity character in the mouth. Consider this with a fresh plate of sushi or spicy grilled chicken for a knockout warm-weather pairing.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8269,Montecillo 2002 Reserva  (Rioja),"More pulpy and flat than ideal, but still this wine shows a lot of spirit and Rioja character. It starts with a jumbled nose of lacquer, shoe polish and licorice, while the palate is chewy and dark, with some briary notes. A good effort from a challenging vintage.",27.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8274,Dominio Buenavista 2007 Veleta Rosé Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra),"Good wines sometimes come out of the woodwork, such as this Tempranillo rosé from the Granada area. It presents as candy apple, both in color and bouquet. But the palate shows nicely with raspberry and cherry flavors. Gets the job done and stirs some interest. Just 350 cases made.",9.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8275,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2006 Berncasteler Doctor Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"Deep gold in color, this is a big, dense, rather high-alcohol wine (11.5%) for a kabinett, with honeyed flavors of Golden Delicious apples, dried apricots and candied pineapple. Yet because of the elevated alcohol level, it's not that sweet, finishing on the dry side, with firm acids.",40.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8277,Warwick 2005 Estate Reserve Red (Stellenbosch),"Berry, dark chocolate and coffee on the nose lead this exuberant red blend from Warwick. Bright fruit flavors and enticing spice on the palate are supported by a solid tannin structure and long finish. Lots of personality and certainly could age, but the wine is approachable now.",28.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8278,Viña Gormaz 2004 Castillo de Gormaz Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Spicy, bretty and leathery; this type of wine represents Ribera in a traditional, no-tricks light. Air only helps it show its best attributes, which revolve around meaty black fruit and herbal accents. It's chewy, sort of tannic and finishes with flavors of moss and jerky. Good for near-term consumption.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
8287,D'Arenberg 2013 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030.",29.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
8301,Kay Brothers 2014 Amery Vineyard Block 6 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020–2030.",120.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
8318,Santa Ema 2015 Select Terroir Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Aromas of lime and tropical fruits are clean and lean. This is lifted by citric acidity and spritz, while flavors of lime, green herbs and bell pepper are authentic. Beyond that, there's not much to this besides overriding freshness.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8332,Aveleda 2014 Charamba Red (Douro),"With soft tannins and ripe berry fruits, this is an immediately accessible wine. It has a fresh character, with a smoky edge and a ripe, smooth aftertaste. This would make a great barbecue wine for the summer.",8.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8334,Casa Ermelinda Freitas 2014 Terras do Pó Chardonnay-Viognier (Península de Setúbal),"A ripe, soft wine that has touches of wood from its four months aging in barrel. There is a spicy, perfumed character with apricot and ripe pear flavors. The acidity is well in balance. Drink this attractive wine now.",20.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8341,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Estate Dry Riesling (Pfalz),"Dusty dried herb notes lend a savory tone to this dry Riesling. Straightforward but brisk, it offers abundant lime acidity off set by fresh apple and pear flavors. Drink now.",19.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
8343,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Tectonia Red (Central Valley),"This blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is fighting (and winning) above its weight (price) class. Tarry, gritty, asphalt-like aromas blend with smoky berry notes to form an inviting bouquet. The palate is round and juicy in feel, with herbal, minty red-berry flavors and a deep, flush finish that's showing a high level of complexity. Drink through 2018.",20.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8345,Caliterra 2011 Edicion Limitada Red (Colchagua Valley),"Aromas of graphite, earthy berry, dried cheese, fine oak and dense black fruits make for a supremely confident bouquet. The palate on this Cabernet-led blend is pure, forward and racy, with depth and structure. Flavors of coconutty oak blend with chocolate, blackberry and cassis, while the finish is ripe, long and satisfying, with just a touch of herbal essence. Drink through 2019.",33.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8349,Morandé 2010 Edición Limitada Carignan (Loncomilla Valley),"This Maule Valley old-vines Carignan opens with licorice, blackberry and cassis aromas along with exotic spice notes. It's big, tannic and firm as a boulder, with baked flavors of black fruits blended with coffee and toast. Licorice, blackened toast and overall grit take this to a good but gripping conclusion. Drink through 2018.",25.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8352,Salomon-Undhof 2009 Noble Rot Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich),"A bit of moody musk precedes notes of lifted orange marmalade—bitter-sweet peel countered by juicy lusciousness. The botrytis is palpable here amongst the concentrated sweetness, so wonderfully shot through with lemony acid. A focused, refreshing BA, with swirls of citrus that go on and on.",40.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8357,Lapostolle 2010 Borobo Red (Rapel Valley),"You can't compare Borobo to anything else because what else is a blend of Carmenère, Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir? Overall, this is a polished wine with tobacco, balsam wood and cedary berry aromas. The palate is soft and rich, with mellow tannins. Flavors of spice, berry and plum are slightly baked, and the finish keeps the mellow, fruity vibe going. Drink through 2018.",85.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8360,Markus Huber 2013 Eiswein Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Bright, zesty lemon appears alongside yellow Mirabell plum that also pervades the palate. There is linear focus, as befits an icewine made from Riesling—and if you have desserts that feature confit lemon, this is what you need. Incredible that something so rich should be so wonderfully light at the same time.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8361,Nigl 2012 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Sultry notions of honeycomb, pine sap and something more tropical—perhaps pineapple, perhaps passion fruit—converge in an incredibly concentrated and at the same time tight and light-footed palate. Passion fruit notes intensify on the palate and while this is very sweet, racy, zesty acidity holds wonderful sway. This expresses the much-lauded purity of Eiswein perfectly.",42.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
8370,Pagos del Rey 2011 Gran Bajoz  (Toro),"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.",30.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
8372,Quinta das Carvalhas 2012 Touriga Nacional (Douro),"Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016.",20.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
8381,Maray 2010 Red (Limarí Valley),"This blend is mostly Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon backing it up. Dense, earthy, meaty and lightly roasted on the nose, the palate is mildly tannic, with lively acidity. Roasted, foresty plum and red-berry flavors end short and baked in character.",26.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
8393,Semeli 2004 Grande Reserve Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"Smoke, cedar and plum aromas are followed by a focused palate of pepper and berry flavors. Poised and sophisticated, this wine is great for fans of drier style reds.",22.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
8397,Vega Escal 2011 Red (Priorat),"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.",23.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
8401,KWV 2004 Merlot (Western Cape),"A subtle nose of smoke and spice leads into flavors of smoke, slightly tart berry and spice on this affordable South African Merlot. Smooth tannins and a soft finish give the wine an everyday, food-friendly feel.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8402,Thorntree 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Tropical fruit and banana on the nose and palate are both exotic and unusual in this affordable Sauvignon Blanc, and a lively acidity adds to the appeal. A refreshing and fun everyday wine, pair this with ethnic food or salads.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8403,Indaba 2007 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"Lively and balanced, this wine offers fresh fruit flavors and an undertone of minerality. A classic but uncomplicated white with a dry character that will pair well with fresh seafood—think ceviche—or Thai food.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8405,Valsanzo 2006 Damalisco  (Toro),"Lots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8406,Castillo de Monjardin 2002 Crianza Red (Navarra),"Dry and leafy in the Cru Bourgeois sense of Bordeaux. And that makes sense given that it's Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from a cool, tough vintage. While not vegetal, the wine is herbal and nervous, with leafy notes and burnt brown sugar flavors.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8407,Masies d'Avinyo 2007 Abadal Blanc White (Pla de Bages),"A strange bird for sure. The blend is 70% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Picapoll. In no way is it common, and truth be told it lags far behind the winery's usually excellent reds. But it does have a lot of kick, body and tropical fruit. And for a unique Spanish white, it may draw some interest because it's not poorly made.",17.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8408,Arroyo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero),"Big and sweet, with ripe berry aromas, candy and leather on the nose. This wine is a classic fruity joven; it's bulky and easygoing, with black cherry, raspberry and chocolate. If you aren't looking for miracles, this is fine within the young Ribera del Duero category.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8409,Viña Albali 1999 Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),"Rusty in color with a neutral, light-styled nose. This wine shows all of its age via lean apple skin and cherry flavors. It's a bit acidic and stripped down, but deep inside there's adequate tobacco, leather and coffee notes.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8411,Osborne Selección 2003 Señorio del Cid Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Osborne is now in Ribera del Duero, and if this wine is an indication of what to expect, then work needs to be done. It has a cheesey nose with no real fruit character. The palate has acidic freshness but also a dearth of substance and a grabby feel. It's not bad wine per se, but in RDD the competition is stiff and this isn't going to draw many converts.",21.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8412,Slowine 2007 Chenin Blanc - Sauvignon Blanc White (Overberg),"This wine offers clean, minerally aromas and a palate of honey and apples. Pair with poultry or fresh seafood. Not overly elegant, but a good wine from a great producer.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8413,Condesa de Leganza 2003 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Fairly rough and gaseous at first (and we tried two different samples), although it does soften with time. The mouth and palate are pretty good: Raspberry and plum flavors are tasty, and the acidity is not lacking. Finishes with earth and a touch of burnt coffee.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
8418,Pago de los Capellanes 2002 Tinto Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Everyone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour. There isn't much middle or body to it, so expect scratchy red fruit and lots of wayward acidity.",49.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8419,Estancia Piedra 2006 Azul  (Toro),"Young, rambunctious Toro is what this is. It's leathery and raw on the nose, with barrel char to boot. The palate is sweet, unctuous and creamy, with candied berry flavors and caramel. And the tannins are typically huge and grabby.",15.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8420,Osborne 2006 Solaz Blanco Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Vibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon. It stretches astringency to its limit, and yet some may like it because it will never be confused for plodding.",10.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
8426,Domäne Wachau 2015 Terrassen Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"Another study in citrus: bergamot peel mixes with fragrant citrus foliage on the nose. The palate brings further harmony with notes of orange and tangerine. The juicy freshness is utterly mouthwatering. The dry, slender palate is seriously playful and playfully serious. Only Riesling can achieve this. Utter joy and supreme refreshment.",19.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
8427,Eichinger 2015 Wechselberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",20.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725

This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness.

And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",29.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725

8813,Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Irresistably juicy and fruity, yet so delicately nuanced by spice, earth and mineral, this light-footed kabinett encapsulates much of what's so special about Mosel Riesling.

The flavors of candied red fruits are basic, while the finish shows residual raspberry flavor and no complexity.",30.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9578,Finca Los Maza 2010 Colección Malbec (Mendoza),"A cool cherry aroma and a mild, creamy paste note open the nose. The feel is fiery and untamed, while full flavors of cherry and plum seem raw. A cocoa flavor and juicy feel define the finish.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9588,Art of Earth 2016 Made With Organic Grapes Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Smoky and earth tones persist from nose to finish here, obscuring fresh lemon and lime on the palate. While off dry in style, its a savory wine with a slightly bitter, waxy finish.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9589,Volver 2016 Tarima Blanco White (Alicante),"Pungent aromas of cactus and sweaty citrus suggest Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo, but this is mostly Merseguera with Macabeo and Moscatel thrown in. A pulpy palate is marginally focused, while this tastes of tropical fruits, namely grapefruit and passion fruit.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9592,Barker's Marque 2016 Ranga Ranga Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"If you like your Sauvignon Blanc on the grassy, herbaceous side, then this little number is for you. A mix of melon rind, candied ginger, lime leaf, and of course, grass show on the palate. Perfect for grilled veg on the barbecue.",14.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9596,Domaine Bousquet 2017 Made With Organic Grapes Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato),"Punchy citrus aromas are prickly on the nose. This wine is quite citric in feel, with lemon extract and lime taking charge.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9597,La Zorra 2014 Teso Blanco White (Sierra de Salamanca),"Bready, oxidized aromas are imprecise and lacking in fruit. This is a blend of Palomino, Rufete Blanca and Moscatel from Salamanca, which is off the beaten path. A plump but flat palate of yeasty white-fruit flavors lacks zest on a fading finish. Drink now.",22.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
9600,Black Hills 2012 Nota Bene Red (Okanagan Valley),"This is the winery's superstar Bordeaux-style blend, and one of the defining red wines of the Okanagan. In its youth it is peppery, tannic and tough, with strong herbal flavors, along with pomegranate, cranberry and white raspberry fruit. It's firmly acidic, lightly toasty, complex and finished with flavors of coffee grounds, cacao, baking spices and smoke. Drink now through 2025.",60.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9601,Bründlmayer 2013 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes.

9603,Hillinger 2012 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Still-subdued fruit signals that this needs time. The palate is tight and elegant, but riches of tart cherry fruit rest just beneath the surface and wait to emerge fully. There is acidic verve and velvety structure; nothing is overdone and it's very balanced. This fresh little number needs time to blossom.",39.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9604,Hillinger 2012 Hill 1 Red (Burgenland),"Spicy white pepper pervades this rich, rounded red. Structured tannins call for meat if this is to be drunk now. These will mellow by 2016 in cellar and the ripe, crunchy red fruit will come to the fore.",75.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9607,Markus Huber 2013 Alte Setzen Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Very ripe yellow pear mixed with punchy arugula create a contrast that makes this wine hard to put down. Partly aged in large, used acacia barrels, partly in stainless steel, the slender but ripe body is accentuated by the peppery edge. Very moreish with a lovely and long finish.",43.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9608,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2012 Samt & Seide Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"This is as tightly closed as a new rosebud, but suspicions of iron oxide and red cherry escape. On the palate this has a northerly, cool aspect and its very own, reticent charm. More iron oxide comes to the fore, along with earthiness and a mix of elderberry and red cherry. If you have the patience to wait until 2017–2018, this will come to you as a grown-up beauty. Its name Samt & Seide—velvet & silk—does it justice indeed.",29.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9609,Nigl 2013 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),A beautifully subtle scent of Williams pear makes for a soft opening. The palate is equally soft but totally driven by the ripeness of the juicy pear fruit streaked with lemon zest on the concentrated palate. Refreshment and enjoyment are programmed into this.,66.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9610,Nigl 2013 Privat Pellingen Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Juicy, luscious Comice pears and floral overtones are brought into tighter focus by the zesty freshness on the concentrated palate that shows intensity and warmth.

9611,Painted Rock 2010 Estate Grown Syrah (Okanagan Valley),"Dark and silky, this bursts open with ripe plum and black cherry fruit.

9615,Mantlerhof 2013 Steingraben Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Yeast and earth can be smelled as much as tart apple, ripe yellow plum and fresh lemon.

9619,Arndorfer 2013 Von Den Terrassen 1979 Roter Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Peaches, red apples and a spray of fresh citrus come together on an earthy, textured and rounded palate that nonetheless is wonderfully light.

9620,Bernhard Ott 2013 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"Savory herbs and peppery watercress dominate the crunchy green pear fruit on nose and palate.

9635,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2007 Palácio da Bacalhôa Red (Península de Setúbal),"A selection from the Quinta da Bacalhôa vineyard, this sumptuous wine layers the darkest fruit flavors with a structure that is solid, dense and powerful.

9638,Quinta do Quetzal 2007 Reserva Red (Alentejano),"Rui Reguinga, named Portugal's Winemaker of the Year in 2009, produces this sumptuous wine.

9646,Luis Duarte 2008 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano),"His skills show in this rich, powerful, finely balanced wine. It has layers of black berry fruits, damsons, bitter chocolate and a good core of acidity. Give this impressive wine 3–4 years.",23.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725
9654,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2011 Monsaraz Reserva Red (Alentejo),"Rich, but structured and balanced, this is a wine that has delicious swathes of ripe blackberry and black plum.

9660,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2011 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Whiffs of smoke and crushed stone form a veil over concentrated peach and preserved quince in this remarkably nuanced auslese.

9665,Mouchão 2012 Dom Rafael Branco White (Alentejo),"A blend of Arinto and Antão Vaz, this is an impressively structured and concentrated wine.

9677,Carmen 2016 Wave Series Left Wave Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Tropical fruit and hay aromas open this plump but basic SB that's low on acidity. Low-energy green-melon flavors are a bit briny, while a lack of punchy acidity leaves a short finish.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
9682,Lagar del Rey 2016 Verdejo (Rueda),"Obtuse, unfocused aromas of squash, carrot and citrus are not as zesty and direct as Verdejo should be. This feels wide, with spritz to the palate. No single fruit flavor stands out in front of a soft finish with mild apple and stone-fruit notes.",25.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
9684,Portal del Priorat 2016 Gotes del Blanques Grenache Blanc (Priorat),"This almost-colorless Grenache Blanc smells of generic white fruits.

9699,Viñas del Vero 2015 La Miranda Secastilla Garnacha Blanca (Somontano),"Waxy pear and apple aromas lead to a lean, acidic palate.

9702,Gemtree 2004 Obsidian Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Gemtree's Obsidian Shiraz ratchets up the intensity from its usual offerings, adding structure and richness to straight-ahead aromas and flavors of cherries, coffee and vanilla.

9705,Peter Lehmann 2004 Eight Songs Shiraz (Barossa),"Matured 18 months in French oak, this rich, velvety-textured Shiraz shows plenty of vanilla influence as a result.

9716,Alto Moncayo 2006 Aquilon Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"As mammoth wines go, this is rock-solid. Sixteen percent alcohol tells you that it's strapping and ripe. But more than just being big and fiery, it's pleasant and sophisticated. The nose offers mocha and raisin, and the palate delivers a feast of toasty, vanilla-edged berry and plum flavors. Fresh and balanced given the level of ripeness and oak treatment. Drink through 2010. 350 cases made.",174.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725

9732,Elias Mora 2004 Reserva  (Toro),"Don't dismiss this aged Toro because it smells cheesy and leathery, and don't give up on it when you're hit with massive tannins. Because once this airs out and settles, you'll have a brawny wine with earthy, loamy flavors of baked blackberry and cassis. Nine years after harvest this is still tannic, grabby and earthy as they come. Drink now through 2019.",120.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
9746,Skoff 2012 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Celery, lemon and zesty grapefruit are the dominating aromatic trio on this slender, moreish offering.

9747,St. Hubertus 2013 Chasselas (Okanagan Valley),"This crisp Swiss white grape is rarely seen in the U.S. and that's a shame.

9760,Dürnberg 2013 Ortolan Cuvée Prestive White (Niederösterreich),"Earthy yeastiness combined with soft lemon freshness creates a very savory wine. While the palate has umami-like spice, it also has a linear lick of clean lemon acid. The two work in contrast and will show their best with a mixed cheese platter.",23.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
9761,Dürnberg 2013 Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Lemon balm, peppery arugula and yeasty savoriness combine into a sleek, streamlined wine that goes down all too easily—notwithstanding its wonderful layers and length.

9764,D'Arenberg 2010 The Bamboo Scrub Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This is a meaty, dark-fruited Shiraz. Seductive notes of caramelized beef and brown sugar dominate, while the wine's texture is a bit coarse, turning astringent on the finish. Try in 2017.",85.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725

Lastly, a delicate herbal note gives this complexity. Drink through 2024.",150.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
9798,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has soft tannins, perfumed blackberry fruit and just enough acidity.

9923,Backsberg 1998 Merlot (Paarl),"A medium to deep ruby color opens things up. The wine is well-balanced and the tannins soft. Unfortunately, however, this structure is fleshed out with only light coffee notes, and therein lies the problem.",14.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
9925,Saxenburg Estate 1998 Merlot (Coastal Region),"More than a touch of green tobacco leafiness shows here. The berry fruit is light, the wine somewhat astringent. There's a touch of earthy complexity, but not much depth or length.",15.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
9937,Almaviva 1998 Red (Puente Alto),"A dense bouquet of dark cherries, plum, earth, meat and subtle tobacco pulls you in. It is big in the mouth, yet never brutish, with lovely depth of fruit flavor, earthy accents and great texture. The fine, long finish has even, dry tannins. Seductively accessible, this world class wine will age well for 6–12 years or longer.",87.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
9939,Jacob's Creek 1998 Limited Release Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Jacob's Creek's top-end red is complex, dense and supple. A seductive bouquet of cassis, Asian spice, leather, cocoa and smoke pulls you in and the palate delivers with a thick, velvety feel and concentrated black fruit. Dry, but ripe and even tannins on the long finish portend a good future for this already attractive wine. Cellar Selection.",50.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9944,Seña 1997 Red (Aconcagua Valley),"From Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick, a Chilean producer (Errázuriz), this wine is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Carmenère. The color is inky dark, and it smells young and intense, almost fiery—there's a suggestion of charcoal and embers. Massive fruit explodes in the mouth, but it's not a fruit bomb; it's much too sophisticated for that. Oak is fancy but not pronounced. Its aging timeline should be similar to that of a great Bordeaux.",60.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
9949,Carmen 1997 Winemaker's Reserve Red (Maipo Valley),"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Grande Vidure, 20% Petite Syrah and 10% Merlot, it is as if you can clearly account for each varietal's contribution. Ripe cassis, cherry, plum, and spice flavors are buttressed by well-integrated oak.  Beautifully balanced, it has good acidity and mature tannins, and closes with a long, satisfying finish. Great wine for tonight's grilled T-bone, and worthy of mid-term cellaring .",40.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
9953,Gimenez Mendez 2015 100 Años Viñas Mendoza Malbec (Montevideo),Inky cool herbal black-fruit aromas set up a choppy tight palate with pounding tannins.

9954,Gimenez Mendez 2015 Las Brujas Red (Canelones),"Inky purple in color, with herbal, minty, toasty berry aromas that suggest a touch of green, this Tannat-Malbec blend tastes of rooty, baked black fruits and black pepper. On the finish, which is hard as rocks, this tastes of licorice and burnt toast.",22.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
9957,Tbilvino 2014 Georgian Valleys Alazani Valley Rkatsiteli (Kakheti),"Deep straw in color, this semi-sweet wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has an aroma characterized by soft hints of apple.

9964,Balduzzi 2013 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley),"Herbal berry aromas are dry and foresty, much like Loire Valley Cabernet Franc. This is superficially creamy and a touch sticky, but otherwise not that deep or dense. Leafy-berry flavors finish with notes of spice, olive and herbal berry. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Merlot is more old school than modern.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
9983,Gustav Adolf Schmitt 2015 Niersteiner Gutes Domtal Spätlese Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Demure yellow apple and tangerine skin notes are riper on the palate in this easygoing but lip-smacking Spätlese.

10000,Villa Huesgen 2015 Schiefer Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Touches of smoked nut and dry clay lend earthiness to this crisp, light-footed wine. Dry in style and briskly acidic, it's invigorating refreshment with a zesty, lime pith finish. Drink now through 2021.",34.0,89,2,0.9994782402321725
10004,Vila 2005 Malbec (Mendoza),"Pretty good wine with only the mildest weedy, herbal notes. For the most part this is full, sunny Malbec; only a hint of green and finishing black pepper vies with the dark berry and plum flavors that one should expect. Decent balance; ordinary as a whole.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
10005,Bodegas Escorihuela 2005 Cruz Alta Reserve Syrah (Mendoza),"Mocha and chocolate welcome you in, but once you get in there isn't much to taste. There's generic red fruit, spice and leather, but the wine seems acidified and on the razor's edge. Not overly generous and the mouthfeel is sheering.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
10024,Campo Eliseo 2009  Toro,"Hailing from a warm region and a warm vintage, this is displaying maximum ripeness on the nose via raisin, prune, blackberry and fig aromas. In the mouth, this is loamy, chewy, a mile deep and rich as Bill Gates. Concentrated black cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha flavors conclude with baked notes, licorice and tobacco. So smooth, yet bullish. Drink through 2022.",85.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
10025,Cepa 21 2010 Malabrigo  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of spiced berry, coffee and balsam wood start slow and pick up intensity. This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028.",90.0,95,2,0.9994782402321725
10036,Artadi 2010 Viña El Pison  (Rioja),"This single-vineyard Rioja is smooth, pure and elegant.

Balanced and structured, with an appealing spice backbone, this wine is an example of an indigenous red with true global appeal.",29.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
10089,Quinta do Romeu 2010 Red (Douro),"Concentrated tannins give this wine from organic grapes a powerful structure. For balance, it also has a more fruity character that offers blackberry and black plums. The dense texture means it needs to age until 2015.",19.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
10091,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Pancas Red (Lisboa),"Just lightly structured, this is a delicious, fruity wine. With soft tannins and rounded black fruits, it's fresh and fragrant. Wood flavors support the fruitiness. Full-bodied and ripe, it's ready to drink.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
10097,El Pensador 2012 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"This Verdejo is in its late stages of life but it's hanging in there. Mostly neutral aromas of apple and lime set up a palate with citrusy acidity that keeps the wine alive. Narrow, simple flavors of orange and nectarine finish pithy but true to the variety. Drink immediately.",13.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
10100,Herdade dos Coelheiros 2009 Tapada dos Coelheiros Red (Alentejano),"The wine is ripe, generous and lightly structured. Black currant and black plum fruits surround a dry core that gives texture. It's not for long-term aging.",38.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725

10132,Wieninger 2014 Rosengartl Gemischter Satz White (Vienna),"The normally so rich Rosengartl comes in a much more slender body for the 2014 vintage, with zesty relish even. Here and there are glimpses of opulence, in the shadows of pleasantly bitter honeycomb that also contributes to a beautifully defined, linear texture on the midpalate. The finish is whistle-clean. Bravo.",55.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10134,Markowitsch 2013 Rosenberg Red (Carnuntum),"Peppery berry fruit is the joyful, dominating factor here. Nose and palate simply burst with spicy fruit. There is some grippy tannin as a counterweight. Wonderful freshness against oaky vanilla provides a subtle, understated nuance. There is absolute elegance despite the exuberance.",35.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10136,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2013 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),"Very subtle hints of blueberry emerge first, while on the palate they color both texture and flavor of this elegantly structured wine. Peppery spice tinges the aftertaste. This is fine-boned and defined, but with upright, well-bred poise and a subtle rather than in-your-face charm. Drink this now with game and venison or treasure it for another 3–5 years.",55.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10143,Steininger 2014 Loisiumweingarten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"The very slightest touch of honey plays among the citrus notes on the nose. There is a touch of yellow pear but the streamlined palate is guided by a seam of lemon zest, smoke, pear and citrus keep echoing each other beautifully. Will benefit from two to three years of bottle age.",22.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10145,Tinhof 2012 Feuersteig St. Laurent (Burgenland),"Crunchy red cherry and stone, the merest hint of vanilla and a densely-packed but toned texture of bundled, fine tannins make for a compact wine. This is too young to show its true colours now and will take time to relax into itself and unfold St Laurent's cherry charm. Right now, everything is tightly grasped and coiled. Drink 2017–2025.",45.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10146,Weninger 2013 Kirchholz Alte Reben Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Fleshy cherry fruit becomes immediately apparent, while on the palate the fruit acquires a spicy edge of appetizing white pepper. This is lip-smackingly fresh, even tart, but in a very appetizing, bracing way that will mellow with another year or two in bottle. The fruit is crunchy and juicy, the tannins are ripe and fine and wood smoke hovers deliciously.",37.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10147,Weszeli 2014 Steinmassl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Oh the purity of freshly cut red-cheeked apples illuminated by equally pure lemon freshness.

10149,Domäne Wachau 2014 Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"What an inviting, friendly perfume of stone-fruit tempered by lemony freshness. This provides glorious refreshment with such a huge amount of charm that it becomes irresistible. Underneath is a creamy but bracing base of texture that anchors this firmly in ancient stone. This soothes and thrills at the same time—what a delicious, compelling paradox.",49.0,93,2,0.9994782402321725
10151,Franz Hirtzberger 2014 Singerriedl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"Perfumed hints of mandarin and stone fruit are subtly expressed on the nose.

10158,Anko 2013 Torrontés (Salta),"Acrid and heavy on the nose, this is not showing any of Torrontés's floral, lighter qualities. Instead, this wine is slightly chemical and rough, with a blocky, citric palate and a mix of bitter citrus and pithy flavors.",14.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
10160,Notro 2011 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Pointed red-plum aromas are lemony and leathery. The palate is decidedly tomatoey and acidic, with flavors of plum skin, currant and pepper. An herbal, spicy, drying finish feels raw and tastes sour.",13.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
10161,Bodegas Tintoralba 2011 Tintorera Higueruela Garnacha (Almansa),"Minty, candied, wet-dog aromas announce that this is a young, basic wine. The mouthfeel is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of candied berry fruits come across dilute and with little depth.",12.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725

10207,Duorum 2015 Colheita White (Douro),"To judge by the weight of the bottle, this wine is meant to be taken seriously.

10223,Quinta do Vesuvio 2015 Pombal do Vesuvio Red (Douro),"Named after the dovecote on the Vesuvio estate, this wine comes from low-yield vines.

10337,Dão Sul 2005 Quinta das Tecedeiras Reserva Red (Douro),"Ripe and spicy, this is an impressive, solid, new wood-dominated wine.

10414,Lapostolle 2015 Casa Grand Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),"A yellow tint and aromas of papaya and melon result in a neutral opening with little pop.

10625,Voyager Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Margaret River),"This is labeled as Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, but be realistic about your expectations: This is 94% Cabernet, with only 5% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot. Cedar, cassis, sage and bay leaf notes are classic Margaret River expressions, as is the wine's medium body and streamlined feel. It's a harmonious if not particularly flamboyant wine that will be at home with a variety of dishes. Drink now–2025.",70.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
10626,Yalumba 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Shiraz (South Australia),"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner.

10635,Fitz-Ritter 2015 Dürkheimer Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"While the nose is austere, suggesting more stone than fruit, the palate of this dry-style Riesling offers loads of juicy, sunny peach and apricot flavors.

10641,Leeuwin Estate 2015 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River),"Tasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian.

10642,Undurraga 2015 T.H. Terroir Hunter Rarities País-Cinsault La Soledad Red (Cauquenes Valley),"On first take, this small-batch blend of País and Cinsault is overtly oaky, with earthy berry and plum notes lurking in the background. A drawing tannic palate lets you know that País is in the house, while this tastes of oaky berry and plum. On the finish, this is more resiny and woody than toasty. Only 235 cases made.

10643,Valdivieso 2010 Éclat Vigno Old Vine Dry-Farmed Carignan (Maule Valley),"Earthy, lightly herbal and stewed aromas of spiced plum, prune and raisin lead to a grabby, tannic, somewhat abrasive palate. Given that this is now seven years past harvest, it's interesting how ripped, gritty and lively it feels. Herbal chunky flavors of spiced berry fruits and residual oak close with energy.

10647,García Figuero 2014 Tinto 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"The nose on this Crianza is front-loaded with oak and related aromas of spice and vanilla. In the mouth, this is tannic and resiny. Similar to the nose, this tastes woody, with barrel-related side notes of cinnamon and clove. A dry pulling tannic finish suggests that another year or two in bottle is in order.

10732,Falua 2011 Tagus Creek Reserva Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),"Firm and concentrated, it has dense tannins that bring out a bitter, chocolate edge.

10750,Piattelli 2007 Grand Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luján del Cuyo, Mendoza.

11049,Zuccardi 2012 Q Malbec (Mendoza),"Blueberry and boysenberry aromas are deep and slightly reduced in nature. This is a chunky, wide-bodied wine with wiry acidity and more power than elegance. Flavors of roasted, toasted black fruits finish blocky and with espresso-like bitterness.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11063,Calcu 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),"Gaseous aromas settle on saline, chlorine and gritty citrus. This is round and not overly acidic in feel, with pickled, briny, green-leaning flavors of lime, cucumber and bell pepper.",14.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
11072,Sierra Norte 2012 Temperamento Bobal (Utiel-Requena),"Earthy, muddled berry aromas are suggestive of prune and raisin. This is full and rugged on the palate, with leathery, baked plum and berry flavors that finish with a strong wood-based character and modest residual fruit notes.",16.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
11089,Casa Santos Lima 2009 Quinta das Setencostas Red (Alenquer),"This is a spicy, rich, smooth wine, immediately attractive and ready to drink. It has ripe tannins, black fruits in abundance and delicious acidity to give a lift. It's a classic barbecue wine and great for summer parties.",8.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11094,Cortes de Cima 2012 Trincadeira (Alentejano),"This is rich and full of superripe fruit that gives the otherwise structured wine a jammy feel. It has a solid, dense texture that brings out blackberry jelly flavors as well as a more tannic core. It's not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2015.",24.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11097,Quinta da Alorna 2011 Portal da Aguia Tinto Red (Tejo),"The second label of Alorna, Portal da Aguia wines develop early. This bright and fruity red is based around soft tannins, very ripe fruits and a juicy, full-in-the-mouth texture. It needs little time to age, so drink from the end of 2014.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11098,Quinta do Cavalinho 2012 Herdade dos Templarios Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"This juicy, fruity wine comes from an estate once owned by the Knights Templar. Full of red berry flavors and acidity, it has a light touch along with a layer of tannins and signs of wood aging. It's likely to age quickly. Drink now.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11106,Valter Sirk 2010 Malvazija Malvasia Istriana (Goriska Brda),"A musky white-flower note melds into savory notes of hazelnut oil and nut skin on the nose and palate of this smoky, rather mysterious wine. Tart with tangerine acidity, it's refreshingly brisk but finishes long with a hint of smoky vanilla.",30.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11107,Bastianich 2010 Adriatico Malvasia Istriana (Istria),"Though aromatically subdued, there's an intensity of tangerine and lime zest flavor in this dry, invigorating Malvasia. The midpalate is marked by elegant white-flower notes that linger on the slightly astringent lime-pith finish.",16.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11109,Borges 2011 Quinta de Simaens White (Vinho Verde),Simaens has produced a ripe style of wine here. Apple and rich citrus flavors add a delicious touch to tropical fruit flavors. This wine is fit for drinking in the next few months.,13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11117,Casa Silva 2007 Microterroir de Los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"This is a funky, pushy type of wine, with prickly aromas of green herb and berry. For a 2007, it is big and a bit rough, with an herbal, green-leaning berry flavor distinctive of this producer and its Los Lingues Vineyard. It finishes with additional herbal kick and heat.",48.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11120,Carmen 2009 Gran Reserva Maipo Alto Petite Sirah (Maipo Valley),"This smells a bit green, with aromas of herb, juniper, cola and earthy black fruit. It feels tannic, with an herbal core. A minty, briary flavor of herb-scented blackberry leads to the firm, tight finish.",15.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11121,Echeverria 2010 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Curicó Valley),"The bouquet is briary, with aromas of clipped berry and herb. It feels sassy, edgy and tannic, with herbal flavors of raspberry and red currant. The finish is a little choppy and tannic, with a subtle green-flavored accent.",12.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11127,Monte da Penha 2005 Reserva Red (Alentejo),"Totally mature, this shows a rustic character and firm, tarry tannins. It is weighty and dense, with a patina of sweet flavors that come with age. Drink it over the next few months.",28.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11128,Monte da Penha 2007 Montefino Red (Alentejano),"Soft, warm and lightly tannic, this has an herbaceous character. Its fresh acidity balances its black currant flavor. It is fragrant, fruity and mature; ready to drink.",10.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11129,Murfatlar 2011 Zestrea Demisec Feteascǎ Regalǎ (Murfatlar),"Hints of sun-dried hay and honey add rustic charm to crisp yellow-peach and apricot flavors on the nose and palate of this off-dry, aromatic wine. Spritely with lemon-lime acidity, it finishes with a refreshing spray of cut green herb.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11139,Finca Sophenia 2008 Altosur Malbec (Tupungato),"Opens with earthy muscle but the nose soon loses focus and freshness as it transitions to rubber and paste along with berry fruit. Hard tannins work the driving palate, while the flavors are of black plum, grape jelly and herbs. Decent but doesn't inspire.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11144,O. Fournier 2008 Urban Uco Malbec (Uco Valley),"Floral blueberry aromas are candied, artificial smelling and sweet, and the palate is supremely rich, sweet, candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec, but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.",11.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11148,Bodega Goulart 2008 T Torrontés (Luján de Cuyo),"Oily matchstick aromas run counter to the wine's innocuous color. The palate is light in weight but heavy in blossomy flavors of orange, lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits. Lacks the lychee/tropical quality that makes Torrontés special, and finishes bitter and pithy.",12.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11158,Tres Palacios 2009 Cholqui Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"This is an herbal, almost throwback style of Carmenère. The nose delivers a blast of tomato leaf along with a rooty, herbal aroma of red fruit suggestive of pizza. The palate is tight and smacks hard with tannins, while the core flavors are roasted and burnt, with a baked berry note and an earthy nuttiness.",26.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11166,Junta 2010 Grand Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"With aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and tomato leaf, this fits the bill for Carmenère. The palate is snappy and lively, with drying, rubbery tannins. Flavors of zesty plum and berry are herbal and spicy, and it finishes with vitality and a scouring scrub of acidity and tannic clamp.",18.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11181,Emiliana 2009 Novas Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Smells good and correct for the variety, with leather, roasted berry and herbal-spicy aromas. Racy and tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and forward flavors of red plum, herbs, vanilla and heat.",16.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11194,Bodegas Adriá 2009 Vega Montán Mencía (Bierzo),"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.",13.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11204,C. von Nell-Breuning 1976 Kaseler Dominikanerberg Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.",101.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11206,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2013 Schrazhofberger Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Crushed mineral and dried sage aromas belie the intensity of fresh nectarine and apricot flavors in this spry, invigorating wine. Striking acidity lends a delicate, lacy mouthfeel accentuated by a sheen of minerality.",34.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11208,Schloss Vollrads 2013 Kabinett Medium-Dry Riesling (Rheingau),"An intense perfume of tropical fruit, flowers and spice extends from nose to finish throughout this extravagant, yet small-footed Riesling. The palate is touched with honey and a bristling lemon-lime acidity that adds elegance and brace.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11210,Sierra Cantabria 2012 Organza White (Rioja),"Dusty and leesy on the nose, this blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca smells of peach pits and oak. Creamy on the palate, this is a touch flat but not flabby. Banana, melon, vanilla and pecan flavors end with a barrel-heavy mix of vanilla and butter.",28.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11215,Avanthia 2011 Tinto Cuvee Mosteiro Mencía (Valdeorras),"Ripe, heady aromas of toasty, creamy oak along with prune, raisin and cedar might be too much for those who are oak averse. Like the nose, the palate is woody and creamy, but also thick and somewhat flabby. Flavors of coconut, mocha, baking spices and blackberry finish woody and with chewy tannins.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11219,Mendoza Vineyards 2011 Unsung Hero Malbec (Mendoza),"Char and gritty scents ride heavily on the bouquet, which also shows fresher notes of cassis and raspberry. This excels via a natural feeling, pulpy palate and flavors of raspberry and red plum accented by pepper and herbs. A lightly herbal, minty finish offers length and good texture.",26.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11220,Montefiore 2011 Karem Moshe Red (Judean Hills),"Dark red-violet in color, this offers aromas of cherry, seawater and molasses, while flavors suggest cherry, cranberry, smoked meat, mocha, mint and eucalyptus. Cool notes outweigh fruit flavors, leading to a sense that something is off balance. Strong tannins back off on a bright finish that fails to diminish the minty notes.",50.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11224,Kim Crawford 2009 Small Parcels Fizz Methode Traditionnelle Sparkling (Marlborough),"As befits a vintage bubbly, this is toasty and yeasty upfront, yet remains fresh and citrusy. It's a medium-bodied sparkler that comes across as fairly dry, making it clean and refreshing on the finish.",35.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11228,Autoritas 2014 Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Dark and muscular up front, with a bright purple color and grapy, woody aromas, this Malbec is pleasant, albeit clipped on the palate. Short, punchy plum and boysenberry flavors finish with a barrel note or two, but not much more.",11.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11233,Woollaston 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson),"This is a light- to medium-bodied example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, one that offers somewhat pungent, sweaty aromas that veer toward scallion at times, followed by mouth-puckering grapefruit flavors.",18.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11244,The Crater Rim 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Waipara),"Pungent and leafy at first, this also boasts honey and passion fruit aromas. It's medium in body, with tropical, pineapple flavors and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink up.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11245,Trinity Hill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (New Zealand),"Traditionally, Hawkes Bay Sauvignon Blancs were riper and richer than Marlborough versions, but that isn't the case for this wine, which carries a modest 12% abv. It's pungently herbal on the nose, while the flavors of white grapefruit are complemented by greenish, leafy notes.",17.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11246,Leyendas de Familia 2013 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Spicy, leafy aromas of tobacco, dried cherry and plum lead to a round palate that's hollow in the middle. Earthy flavors of mixed berry fruits and spice end chunky and herbal, which is par for the course for Carmenère.",14.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11249,Strauss 2014 Gamlitzberg Gelber Muskateller (Südsteiermark),"Summer blossom, honeysuckle, even rose petals appear on the aromatic nose. The slight and slender palate is poised and comes on very light feet. This is a breezy, easy summer wine to be drunk as soon as possible.",24.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
11256,Vionta 2011 Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Butterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.",15.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11258,Wrongo Dongo 2011 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Jammy berrry, raisin and licorice aromas lead to a chewy, somewhat raisiny palate with prune, blackberry and herbal flavors. A mild-tasting finish with raisiny chunkiness and herbal notes is consistent with the nose and palate. This is good for under $10 despite being very ripe.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11260,O. Fournier 2012 Urban Uco Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),"Sassy passion-fruit and feline aromas set up a crisp, clean-feeling palate with tangy, green, zesty flavors of scallion, lime and sour apple. A minerally, chalky finish is zingy and clean. This is nice for value-priced Sauvignon Blanc.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11268,Altocedro 2012 Año Cero Tempranillo (La Consulta),"This Tempranillo is a heavy, saturated number with rubbery plum and berry aromas. It's totally Argentinean in style and shares little to nothing with Spanish versions; it's full bodied but not showing much in the midpalate, while generic berry flavors offer chocolate notes and finish short.",19.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11274,Monte Xanic 2011 Limited Edition Cabernet Franc (Valle de Guadalupe),"With aromas of salsa, chili peppers and tomato, this Cab Franc almost smells like the food it might go with. In the mouth, it's ripe and full of sweet cherry, plum and spice flavors. On the backside it shows milk chocolate, candied berry notes and modest tannins. Good with churrasco or roast pork; made with 20% Merlot.",39.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11275,El Coto 2008 Coto Real Reserva  (Rioja),"Tobacco, dill and vanilla aromas transition to cherry and raspberry scents. The high-acid, cutting palate contains tart raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors that maintain through the finish. From a rough vintage, this wine is not excelling.",45.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11276,Emina 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Ripe berry aromas approach raisiny, but settle on jammy plum and leather. This is tannic and wide, with ruggedness to the mouthfeel. Flavors of earthy berry, baked fruits and cocoa end with grab, heat and burn. This is good but rough, like a gravel road.",21.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
11279,Pascual Toso 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"As per usual, Toso's regular varietal Malbec is pleasing, honest and shows the variety in its best, affordable form. Meaty and rich on the nose, with an inky accent. The palate has the right feel and solid flavors of blackberry and raspberry. Competently covers the spectrum of aromas, feel and flavors.",13.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11280,D'Arenberg 2008 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale),"Intense and tightly wound, this Riesling gradually unfolds layers of white pepper, green plums and Key lime pie. The lingering quince-flavored finish is mouthwateringly crisp but not quite dry. Try with mushroom pasta. Drink now for the youthful fruit or wait a few years for more complexity.",16.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11284,Loimer 2008 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"From young vines on valley floor vineyards, this is a simple but delicious wine. Ginger, cinnamon and lime come together to give freshness with a twist. The finish is crisp. Screwcap.",20.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11285,R&A; Pfaffl 2008 Haidviertel Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"Fine green fruit gives great freshness in this crisp, citrus and apple flavored wine, lightly softened with melon. Pure, clean, a lively, bright wine.",23.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11292,Enon 2005 Que Sera Shiraz (Robertson),"Aromas of red berry, wild cherry, clove and cinnamon give this Shiraz a stylish start. Flavors of red fruit, spice and anise are integrated and smooth. Well structured but drinkable now. The lingering finish offers pepper, anise and spice.",15.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11298,Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Zweigelt (Thermenregion),"A restrained nose leads to a cherry-fruited, sprightly, light palate.

11304,Leth 2016 Roter Veltliner (Wagram),"Wonderfully ripe and pure red and green apple notes rise from the glass. The palate shines with the same full-flavored fruit, edged by freshness and a slight spritz. The finish is generously zesty and dry but fruity.",25.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
11307,Markus Huber 2016 Zweigelt Rosé (Weinland Österreich),An appetizing touch of red currant and cranberry plays on the nose of this vividly colored rosé. The palate is fruit-forward with subtle shades of berry and citrus. The finish is refreshing and berry-laden.,18.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
11314,Netzl 2016 Classic Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum),"Grapefruit spiciness and a touch of yeast show on the nose of this wine. The palate revolves around zesty grapefruit flavors, its concentration and juiciness leading to a tingling, refreshing finish that's wonderfully clean.",16.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
11323,Château Lacave 2002 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Serra Gaúcha),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend almost has enough of the right stuff to rate higher, but in the end the wine's tart cherry fruit and sharp acidity is just too unfriendly. Like so many Brazilian wines, it's trying to be more than the country's terroir can give. So the end result is mediocre.",20.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
11324,Castillo Viejo 2007 Parcela Vieja Tannat (San Jose),"Brambly and stalky berry fruit aromas come with citrus and leafy accents. The palate is sheer and tannic, with candied, spiced, red fruit flavors. Heat and burning acidity make the finish rather rough.",20.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
11331,Bodegas Valdemar 2009 Conde de Valdemar Finca Alto Cantabria Viura (Rioja),"Flat aromas include iodine, butterscotch and cider, but overall the nose isn't that lively or fresh. The palate, meanwhile, is round, soft and mealy, with oaky, barrel-fermented flavors of buttered baked apple and resin. Proves why barrel-fermented Viura is sketchy terrain.",15.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
11343,Viña Requingua 2011 Toro de Piedra Gran Reserva Single Vineyard Merlot (Curicó Valley),"Roasted, smoky initial aromas give way to olive and sassy red-fruit scents.

11344,Volver 2012 Tarima White (Alicante),"In this very basic wine, applesauce aromas are followed by a plump, somewhat citrusy feeling palate. Flavors of nectarine are good and clean, while the finish is solid.",9.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11345,Terras de Alter 2012 Terra D'Alter Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano),"Firm layers of wood give a hard initial impression. There are hints of fruit under this plank-like character, but it will need some time to balance out, if at all.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11347,Landhaus Mayer 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Soft and pliable in body, it has gentle citrus hints and crisp acidity.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11348,Loma Larga 2010 Unfiltered Cabernet Franc (Casablanca Valley),"This smells gritty and herbaceous.

11351,Calcu 2013 Rosé (Colchagua Valley),"This is light in color, with minerally aromas and a hint of tropical fruit on the nose.

11352,Casal da Coelheira 2010 Terraços do Tejo Red (Tejo),"This big, spicy wine is dominated by licorice and heavy toast wood flavors. It is rich and full of black plum skins with only a hint of acidity. The aftertaste is sharp and bitter.",13.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
11366,Bouza 2011 Reserva Tempranillo-Tannat (Montevideo),"Rubbery aromas of plum and wild berry turn toward earthy with airing.

11367,Bouza 2013 Reserva Tannat (Montevideo),"Bouza continues to lead the Uruguayan charge via wines like this Tannat, which is purple in color and concentrated on the nose, with blackberry pie and raisin aromas. A stout, full-bodied palate is chewy and oaky, while prune, blackberry, brine, char and toast flavors finish dark and spicy, with a raisiny note. Drink through 2017.",19.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11374,Celler Piñol 2009 L'Avi Arrufi Red (Terra Alta),"Scratchy red-fruit aromas are a bit raw and chemical. This is grabby and gritty in the mouth, with flavors of plum, berry, green herbs and oaky carob. A woody, tannic, lightly herbal and green finish feels drawing and snappy. This is mostly Carignan with lesser amounts of Garnacha and Syrah.",49.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
11375,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Lab Premium Red (Douro),"Winemaker Francisco Olazabal, from Quinta do Vale Meão, produces this ripe, smoky wine from vineyards above the Douro River.

11379,Mas Igneus 2012 Barranc dels Closos White (Priorat),"Dusty notes and beeswax aromas dominate this wine, which is 90% Garnacha Blanca and the rest Pedro Xímenez. Tight and grabby, with staunch acidity, this tastes of white pepper, grass and waxy stone fruits. Briny notes and citric acidity on the finish are offset by tropical accents of papaya and melon.",25.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

11420,Solabal 2006 Crianza  (Rioja),"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast.

11422,Lawson's Dry Hills 2008 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"With only 6.5 g/l of residual sugar, this weighty wine comes across as almost dry, allowing the emphasis to be on the bold notes of melon, pear and citrus.

11427,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 129 Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",15.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725

11479,Adega de Cantanhede 2014 Marquês de Marialva Reserva Arinto (Bairrada),"While the Arinto is normally found further south in Lisboa, this wine comes from vines that have the same ocean influence. That keeps it fresh even through the oak aging, so the wine is both rich, toasty and cut with attractive citrus acidity. This one is still young and will be better from 2017, although it is ready to drink now.",12.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725

11504,Solabal 2005 Esculle de Solabal  (Rioja),"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha.

11507,Henschke 2005 Abbotts Prayer Vineyard Red (Lenswood),"A blend of 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, the resulting wine is complex, round and complete. Aromas and flavors of plum, leather, cured meat and spice are carried by plenty of weight, yet without seeming heavy. There's a lush, slightly creamy mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Delicious now, but should hold at least through 2015.",75.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
11508,Paul Cluver 2006 Noble Late Harvest Riesling (Elgin),"From elegant white producer Paul Cluver, this wine starts with a beautiful nose of fragrant peach, honey and apricot, then unfolds into an enticing balance of lush peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.

11522,Bodegas Riojanas 2004 Monte Real Reserva  (Rioja),"Ripe and leaning to the dark fruit side, with spicy blackberry aromas. Feels round and complete as it unfolds, and not at all edgy.

Will age for another decade without much trouble, but it's more than drinkable now.",27.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
11541,Finca del Marquesado 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"A mix of raisin and tomato on the bouquet is touched up by spice notes. This has a medium-weight body and hard tannins in front of live-wire plum, raspberry and mild herbal flavors.

11556,Santa Carolina 2012 VSC Assemblage Red (Cachapoal Valley),"This dark, concentrated blend of five grapes opens with spicy aromas of coffee, black fruits and toasty oak.

11562,Tegernseerhof 2015 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"The tanginess of grapefruit peel, paired with very ripe Bosc pear, is already apparent on the nose before becoming full-blown on the palate. There is concentration and precision. The ripeness of this vintage is nicely corralled and held in check by citrus freshness and countered by yeasty richness and spice. The finish is gloriously enlivening, fresh and moreish.",39.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725
11566,Alzinger 2015 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"The nose is closed and only gives the merest hint of ripe Bosc pear. This fruit blossoms on the palate, which edges this rich and ripe core with hints of beeswax and grapefruit zest. These notions also appear as a textural element on a concentrated precise body. The finish majors on that wonderfully spicy zestiness and is amazingly pure.",60.0,94,2,0.9994782402321725
11568,Bründlmayer 2015 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Yeasty savoriness on the nose conjures up salty hints of miso and soy, alluringly so. The palate is even more salty and expressive, with waves of tingling white pepper. The fruit that lurks through is of green Conference pear and more greenish savor: think nettle and lovage, even watercress. A lemony fillip provides a fresh backbone. What a joy to drink.

11587,Anakena 2013 Ona Special Reserve Riesling-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Leyda Valley),"Honey blossom and grassy aromas are all right, but struggle to offer much fruit.

11615,Aitor Ider Balbo 2006 El Encanto Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"A dose of cherry cough drop adds sweetness to what is otherwise a tart, simple, steely version of Cabernet Sauvignon blended with Malbec.

11968,Makura Estate 2008 Estate Reserve Red (Upper Galilee),"Deep garnet to the eye, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah offers a rich bouquet of cassis, cherry preserves and lightly buttered toast.

Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate.

12025,Santa Rita 2004 Triple C Red (Maipo Valley),"Not often do you find blends of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère. And it's been a while (1999) since we last tasted it; this version is ripe, a bit hard and very, very serious.

12071,Herdade de São Miguel 2010 Ciconia Red (Alentejano),"A soft, earthy wine with light fruits and plum jelly flavors. It is a wine that should be drunk young to enjoy its balance of fruitiness, acidity and light tannins. Screwcap.",10.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
12084,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Thick, raisiny and a heavy on first take, with meaty aromas. Feels jammy and soft, but the middle layers aren't well defined. Tastes dark and sweet, with fig, prune and lemony oak. Bulky, but struggles to reach a higher plane.",23.0,85,2,0.9994782402321725
12086,Wittmann 2010 Westhofen Aulerde Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Everything about this Riesling is elegant and balanced: Sweet-tasting, honeyed fruit and flower elements are countered by smoke and savory fennel notes. Rich, creamy textures are enlivened by a shock of lemon-lime acidity. Juicy yet refined, it lingers long with a kiss of sweet nectarine flavor.",100.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
12089,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2007 Lieu Dit Malakoff Shiraz (Pyrenees),"This partnership continues to turn out marvelously complex wines from inland Victoria. Savory, herbal and intriguing on the nose, with hints of raspberry, mushroom and smoked meat, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine. Dusty tannins impart a silky quality to the finish. Drink now–2018.",30.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
12091,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2010 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dark, mysterious aromas of smoke, petrol and brine are enticing on the nose. Semisweet in style, with an abundance of honeyed stone-fruit and citrus flavors, this wine shows glimmers of maturity already, but it's structured enough to improve for at least 7–10 more years.",70.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
12097,Finca Agostino 2008 Agostino Familia Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza),"This opens with smoky, powerful aromas of black fruit and oak. The palate feels flush, offering several levels of character and complexity. Flavorwise, this pulses with blackberry, cassis and fudge, before finishing with subtle prune, mint and chocolate notes. Not edgy or hard. A blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet and Syrah.",30.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
12099,Viñedos de Paganos 2005 El Puntido Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy, roasted aromas of dry berry and leathery spice are alluring. The wine feels mature but forward, with a mild, resiny oak note driving the roasted red-berry, tobacco, spice and lemon flavors. It feels smooth and plush on the finish, with structure and spine. Drink now–2018.",57.0,92,2,0.9994782402321725
12119,Santa Alicia 1999 Gran Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Char and blackberry flavors on the palate are as brooding asthe dark soil, oak and berry fruit on the nose. Tannins speak louder than flavors in this wine; it's black, and with a little more lushness, could be a beauty.",14.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12129,Santa Rita 2011 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A flat bouquet smells mostly of root beer, grass and herbal black fruits. This is chunky and lacking a central point of reference. Rooty, creamy, oaky flavors taste a lot like vanilla or a root beer float, while oak and caramel flavors control a finish that lacks drive.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
12132,Odfjell 2013 Armador Carmenère (Central Valley),"Rooty, minty aromas of blackberry and boysenberry are heavy on the nose. This feels blocky and full-bodied, with loamy, jammy black-fruit flavors that show a typical varietal greeness. A finish with herbal, tomatoey flavors includes a dusting of chocolate.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
12133,Palliser Estate 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough),"At the risk of overgeneralizing, Martinborough Sauvignons typically show less overt herbal characters than their Marlborough counterparts. At least, that's the case for this medium-bodied wine. White grapefruit, stone fruit and underripe melon notes finish crisp and clean.",20.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
12151,Wakefield Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a fresh, fruity rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe, peachy notes on the nose give way to hints of nectarine and citrus on the palate. It's plump and round in feel, with a moderately long finish.",13.0,87,2,0.9994782402321725
12155,Vaya Vadiso 2012 Merlot (Central Valley),"Rubbery, tarry, herbal berry aromas lead to a fresh, lean, somewhat acidic palate. Flavors of plum, red currant and green herbs finish with zest and juicy acidity.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12156,Anakena 2012 Ona Special Reserve Chardonnay-Viognier-Riesling White (Leyda Valley),"Oaky aromas have a lacquer-like scent that dissipates into sawdust if given time. This is plump and melony in feel, with a resiny note to the texture. Fully ripe white-fruit flavors revolve around mealy melon, and there's an oxidized note to the finish.",19.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12161,Cremaschi Furlotti 2011 Edición Limitada Carignan (Loncomilla Valley),"Talk about an overoaked wine. From the start, this struggles to keep it real. Aromas of shoe polish, vanilla and scorched oak are dominant. Firm and tannic in the mouth, this Carignan tastes almost entirely of wood resin and mint. That this is oaky and resiny on the finish is no surprise.",35.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12162,Judith Beck 2012 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"A mix of blackberry and red currant flavors play on the nose and palate. Fruit is undoubtedly the core of this wine, with easy tannin and fresh acidity channelling it into a pleasant, fruity red for early drinking.",20.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12170,Sepp Moser 2011 Hedwighof Zweigelt (Neusiedlersee),"Cranberry sauce flavors and refreshing acidity make this a very delicious wine to be consumed young. Unhindered by oak or undue extraction, this shows its charming, primary fruit in an open, uncomplicated way. This is a winner with charcuterie and salami.",10.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12181,Díaz Bayo 2011 Francisco Díaz Bayo Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Raisin and prune aromas are components of the nose on this ripe Ribera del Duero that offers additional notes of fig and chocolate. A fleshy, thick palate deals earthy black-fruit, prune and spicy flavors prior to a chunky, chewy finish. Drink through 2024.",34.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12183,El Enemigo 2014 Gran Enemigo Gualtallary Single Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"Smooth, savory aromas of prune and blackberry are foresty and lightly herbal. This round-bodied Cab Franc from Tupungato is solid and balanced, with controlled tannins. Oaky flavors of plum, herbal tea and smoke finish savory. Drink through 2023; contains 15% Malbec.",120.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12193,Tinhorn Creek 2013 Oldfield Series Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley),"Pure varietal, this spent 18 months in French oak. Dried cherries, plums and tobacco combine, at first quite tight and compact, but eventually opening into a full-bodied and flavorful red. A touch of maple syrup from the barrel aging sweetens the tannins and enlivens the finish.",32.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12206,Quinta do Carmo 2004 Red (Alentejano),"Ripe fruit, good, even high acidity, a touch of wood: everything is here, except for the nagging edge of rusticity that often pervades the Carmo estate wine. It needs more polish.",26.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12207,Quinta do Gradil 2005 Cortello Syrah (Estremadura),"A lean, edgy wine, which shows bramble fruits, red berries and tense tannins. There's fine structure and, given a few months, the acidity will turn this into a good food wine.",8.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12208,Sumarroca 2004 Brut Reserva Cava Sparkling (Penedès),"Nothing really sticks out on this perfectly good brut. It offers the basic aromas of green apple and lime, followed by flavors of apple juice, citrus and pineapple. It takes on weight as it opens and then finishes a bit sweet.",12.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12210,Spice Route 2006 Pinotage (Swartland),"Blackberry, red berry and tobacco, along with exotic spiced meat and coriander flavors, offer complexity and intrigue in this concentrated treat. Good structure and a light touch of minerality—complete with a wave of the varietal alkaline—give the wine a distinctive character. Pair with grilled meat.",23.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12212,Capafons-Ossó 2003 Masos d'en Cubells Red (Priorat),"Time will only help this tough, rough Priorato that isn't offering a whole lot now besides tannin, dark-fruit flavors and searing oak. The flavors are middle-of-the-road in terms of friendliness and complexity, so expect a forward, hard-hitting wine. Should be more revealing in a few years.",55.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12214,Avanthia 2010 Tinto Cuvee Mosteiro Mencía (Valdeorras),"Lemony oak, tobacco, sandalwood and berry fruit aromas come together in fine form. This is a full, heavily oaked wine with big tannins and plenty of ripeness and power. Baked black-fruit flavors are propped up by spicy oak, pepper and herb notes, while the finish is spicy, woody, dry and long. Drink through 2018.",25.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12235,Koyle 2009 Royale Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Cassis, red licorice candy and leather are the key aromas on this full-bodied, ripe Syrah. Things run big but healthy on the tongue, while flavors of black fruits, toast, coconut and chocolate announce plenty of oak. A rich, persistent finish is just bright enough. Drink through 2015.",26.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12238,Alto Los Romeros 2011 Gran Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"This is a jammy, lusty wine with aromatic notes of graphite on top of core blackberry scents. The palate is chunky and full, while the flavor profile is pure jammy blackberry. A quick, staunch finish is a fine conclusion.",17.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12249,Siegel 2012 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Minty plum and berry aromas are herbal but ripe, with a note of chocolate and black tea. This is lush and layered, with top-end mouthfeel and herbal, floral flavors of berry fruits and plum. A smooth, herbal tasting finish is the finale to a well-made, flavorful wine.",22.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12250,Estampa 2011 Estate Malbec-Petite Sirah Red (Colchagua Valley),"Savory and earthy up front, this blend of Malbec and Petit Sirah is quite ripe and not at all herbal. In the mouth, it's cushioned and rich, while dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and pepper finish a touch bitter, like dark chocolate or a cup of espresso.",15.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12251,Estate Biblia Chora 2007 Ovilos Red (Pangeon),"Blueberry, vanilla and cedar aromas start this rich, luxuriant red. On the palate, savory cigarbox and caramel flavors meld with bright red fruits and sweet vanilla. The wine finishes dry and will pair beautifully with lamb and beef dishes.",55.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12257,Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
12259,Vistamar 2009 Enki Carmenère-Carignan Red (Central Valley),"This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.",30.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
12263,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2011 Niersteiner Hipping Spätlese Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame. The fruit profile is tropical with concentrated guava and mango flavors spiced with hints of white pepper. It's semi-sweet in style, but bracing acidity leaves the finish quite dry.",18.0,88,2,0.9994782402321725
12283,Viña Bisquertt 2013 Missing Rosé (Curicó Valley),"This salmon-colored rosé is made from the País grape, a.k.a. the Mission Grape. On the nose, it's a cypher with weak fragrances of peach and mango. The palate is cidery and hard in feel, while briny, tart citrus flavors are pithy and fail to evolve or improve on the finish.",15.0,83,2,0.9994782402321725
12288,Santa Rita 2010 Reserva Organic Carmenère (Central Valley),"This is downright herbaceous from front to back. Hard aromas suggest eucalyptus, black olive and sweaty leather. In the mouth, grit and high acidity provide little cushion, while herbal flavors of cherry and blackberry taste salty and baked.",13.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
12293,Carma 2011 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Aromas of coffee grinds and muddled blackberry lead to a shrill palate with a shaky structure. Stewy plum and raspberry flavors finish salty, lightly weedy and baked in feel.",10.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
12296,Emiliana 2012 Natura Malbec (Rapel Valley),"Sour plum and cranberry aromas are almost volatile, leading to a racy, acidic palate. Snappy, tart flavors of red plum and pie cherry finish with scouring acidity. This is a fresh but raw Malbec.",11.0,82,2,0.9994782402321725
12298,Beach Kite 2013 Moscato (Central Valley),"Rough, almost harsh aromas of petrol and sauerkraut are less than inviting. This is bland and soft in feel, with almost no spritz or lift. Innocuous flavors of melon, papaya and honey finish flat and sugary.",7.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
12299,Estampa 2013 Assemblage Reserve White (Colchagua Valley),"This is a vegetal, underripe wine, albeit one with a fresh palate. The nose, flavor profile and finish are decidedly green and pyrazinic. Made from 94% Sauvignon Blanc with Chardonnay and Viognier.",20.0,81,2,0.9994782402321725
12300,Quintay 2013 Clava Reserve Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Rubbery, animal-like aromas are low on fruit. The palate is shrill and dominated by sharp acidity. Sour, herbal and pinched tasting, this is tart and green overall.",14.0,80,2,0.9994782402321725
12302,Anton Bauer 2014 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram),"Peachy notes are accentuated by a very floral, creamy touch of oak to create a very appetizing, inviting nose. The palate is more rounded, flanked by sonorous but subtle oak spice and gentle fruit with a core of freshness and life that comes together on the long, spicy finish.",35.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12311,Meinklang 2012 Konkret St. Laurent (Neusiedlersee),"Plush, almost candy-like berry notes mingle with fresher inflections of moss on the aromatic nose. The soft and supple palate unleashes even more berry and cherry fruit, so much so that it takes a moment to realise that there is an actual, firm structure to support this purple-tinged display which finishes in medium-bodied spiciness.",39.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12312,Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Ried Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"There's an almost honeyed edge to the nose of this charming, composed wine. The sprightly palate is highlighted by a spritz of lemon here and there and the occasional flash of white pepper. This has a masterfully light touch.",33.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12313,Steindorfer 2013 Apleton Rouge Red (Burgenland),"A distinct whiff of tiny, black elderberries promises joy. This is joined by white pepper and iron oxide to play on luscious but soft red and black fruit. The spice is exciting and pervasive and highlighted by freshness. The fine balance this strikes is expressed as straight-laced elegance. What unpretentious, honest joy.",25.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12314,Steininger 2014 Seeberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Aromatic stone fruit swings in those lively citrus notes. There is a creamy apple flavor in the background, softening the bold lemon notes. This is pure and lifted, graceful and slender.",29.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12316,Türk 2014 Kremser Sandgrube Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Ripe, yellow pear shines through the savory yeast notes on the nose. The palate unites white pepper and herbal notes of chervil and lovage with lemony freshness. Moreish and appetizing, with a lingering white pepper and citrus finish.",27.0,91,2,0.9994782402321725
12321,Erwin Sabathi 2014 Pössnitzberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"There is a smoky edge to the grassy notes on this slightly aromatic white. Underneath there is some appealing, creamy citrus that puts the palate on a different, more serious footing. This is very fresh and very light, but it has character.",50.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12327,Graf Hardegg 2014 Steinbügel Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Smoke, yeast, earth and peppery herbs unite to make an almost archetypal Grüner. The palate has the same savory core but also introduces green and yellow pear to create a very harmonious, textured palate that just sings with spice and pepper.",39.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12329,Greywacke 2013 Wild Sauvignon Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Struck flint and tomato leaf notes add welcome complexity to this wine's grapefruit aromas and flavors. For a wild-ferment Sauvignon Blanc, it's reasonably clean, with moderate body and a long, dry finish.",29.0,90,2,0.9994782402321725
12336,Boutari 2006 Kretikos Red (Crete),"The nose on this soft red smacks of black cherry and spice, and the like flavors are smooth. Tannins are firm but the wine has a light touch overall. The finish has a spicy spin. Pair with lighter poultry dishes.",15.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12342,Kumeu River 2007 Pinot Gris (Kumeu),"Despite sufficient residual sugar to render it off-dry, this Pinot Gris retains a slightly tart, lean character. Underripe stone fruit and pineapple flavors lack richness and generosity, ending on a tart, citrusy note.",22.0,84,2,0.9994782402321725
12350,Cartuxa 2014 EA Branco White (Alentejano),"This is a friendly fruity wine that has a soft texture and bright acidity. If it does miss a sense of place, it makes up for it with citrus and white fruit flavors that are so fresh. Drink now.",9.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12351,Fiuza 2014 Native Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),"Considering both grapes in the blend are known for their tannic structure, this is ripe and open. It is fruity with red berry flavors and acidity to balance. There is a round soft aftertaste. Drink now.",10.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
12354,Campolargo 2012 Branco Barrica Bical (Bairrada),"The Bical grape is often found in Bairrada's sparkling wines. Here, aged in wood, it undergoes a metamorphosis. It is soft and smooth, lightly oxidized with the wood dominating the fruitiness. There are spices and a ripe feel that leaves a spicy tropical fruit aftertaste.",28.0,86,2,0.9994782402321725
