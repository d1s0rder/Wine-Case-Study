93,Leyda 2015 Single Vineyard Falaris Hill Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty, while this holds form on a high-acid finish.",18.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
175,Emiliana 2008 Natura Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas.

194,Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape),"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom.

Drink now.",20.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
206,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",25.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
245,Jardin 2009 Nine Yards Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche.

279,Cramele Recas 2009 Chardonnay (Recas),"Fragrant on the nose with fresh orange, lemon and honeysuckle aromas, this full-bodied Chard is deliciously quaffable with a concentrated apple palate and just a hint of buttered toast. Another well-made Romanian at an unbeatable bargain price.",7.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
295,De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.",18.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
307,Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting.

352,San Pedro 2002 Castillo de Molina Reserva Chardonnay (Lontué Valley),"Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich, and, for now, the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking.",11.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
362,Lapostolle 2007 Casa Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith.

715,Viña Cobos 2015 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Chardonnay (Perdriel),"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way.

872,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity.

1033,Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.",18.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
1055,Trapiche 2007 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",17.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
1124,Danie de Wet 2008 Limestone Hill Chardonnay (Robertson),"This wine has a delicate nose of citrus and spicy nuts, with robust, round flavors of apple, citrus and spice.

1342,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",12.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
1355,Michel Torino 2007 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",12.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
1358,Santa Julia 2007 Organica Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity.

1403,Rubus 2016 Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Melon, wood spice and vanilla aromas are common for this level of Chilean Chardonnay. A plump palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of pear, oak and skins-based bitterness. A woody tasting finish is adequate.",15.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
1486,Jacob's Creek 2016 Chardonnay (Australia),"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.",8.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
1543,Recanati 2006 Kosher Chardonnay (Galilee),"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance.

1552,Tyrrell's 2006 Lost Block Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features ample apple, pear and pineapple fruit that comes across as pleasant and mouthfilling, if also a bit one-dimensional. Still, it represents a reasonable value.",14.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079

1998,Arboleda 2014 Chardonnay (Aconcagua Costa),"Nutty aromas of popcorn, buttered toast, peach and apple create a solid nose. This feels lively but also a bit oily. A mix of roasted nut, wood resin and pineapple flavors finish toasty, with racy acidity working as a preservative.",20.0,88,9,0.9996874899342079
2095,Picardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton),"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.",33.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
2331,Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland),"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",21.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
2377,Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",12.0,83,9,0.9996874899342079
2442,La Playa 2002 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit.

2454,Viña Santa Monica 2001 Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.",8.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
2482,Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Chardonnay (Chile),"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish.",11.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
2501,Rios de Chile 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch.

2521,Albamar 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body, while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing.",12.0,83,9,0.9996874899342079
2522,Indomita 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose.

2540,Valentin Bianchi 2011 Elsa Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",10.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
2661,Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo),"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors.

2715,Gruber Röschitz 2015 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness.

3020,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja),Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,9.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079

3124,Hill-Smith Estate 2014 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"This hand-picked, wild-fermented Chardonnay offers a lot to like.

3226,Viña Cobos 2016 Felino Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Aromas of apple cider, peach and oak lead to a full palate. Flavors of melon and banana have a nutty quality, while this is stable on the finish, with tropical fruit and honeyed flavors. Drink now.",20.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
3325,Luis Felipe Edwards 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",9.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
3507,Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria),"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth.

3534,Monteviejo 2013 Lindaflor Chardonnay (Uco Valley),"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic.

3675,Ridgeview Estate 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus.

3793,Olsen Private Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Paarl),"This wine is so woody and toasty upfront, the bouquet brimming with scents of wood-grilled apple, mealy melon and lemon custard.

3821,Te Mata 2014 Elston Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay),"To my mind, Te Mata's strength s are in its red wines. That said, this is a solid Chardonnay.

4585,Maray 2012 Limited Edition Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"Maray Chardonnay is crisp and mineral-driven on the nose, but not overly fruity.

4628,Anton Bauer 2015 Kreuzgang Chardonnay (Wagram),"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness.

4960,Casas del Bosque 2013 Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Sweaty, briny aromas are borderline offputting.

4981,Santa Alba 2012 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"The aromas are driven by freshly cut wood tones, while the palate is full, creamy and oaky.

5094,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2014 Chardonnay (Leithaberg),"An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity.

5231,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Popcorn, paint thinner and other oak-driven aromas control the nose on this resiny, woody wine. Like the nose, the flavor profile is barrel dominated. It finishes with resin, sawdust and bitter flavors.",20.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
5380,Lomas del Valle 2015 Coastal Cool Climate Wine Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of apple, orange peel and citrus oil are reasonably interesting.

6676,Yering Station 2000 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),"This medium-bodied Chard has some butterscotch notes on the nose, but thankfully lacks similarly overpowering flavors on the palate. Some citrus flavors accent the wine's peachy core; finishes a little watery.",20.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
6723,Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",12.0,83,9,0.9996874899342079

6816,Guelbenzu 2002 Jardin Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Anise and mineral add character to the aggressive, starchy nose. Flavors of ripe apple and mustard create a heavier-than-usual palate, although there's ample acidity to keep it more or less balanced. The finish is dry, with just a touch of citrus flavor. And at the very end it turns thin and rough.",9.0,83,9,0.9996874899342079
6822,Château Los Boldos 1999 CLB Reserve Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Pungent, grassy aromas seem off center for Chardonnay, while the mouthfeel is heavy and the flavors seem derived from overripe fruit. The finish is woody and has plenty of texture, but there's also a piercing bolt of acidity running through the middle.",14.0,82,9,0.9996874899342079
6905,De Bortoli 2007 Deen de Bortoli Vat 7 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"This medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts a fair degree of complexity for its modest tariff: slightly toasty, nutty aromas lead into flavors of hazelnut, ripe peach and citrus. A solid effort.",13.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
6980,Jardin 2012 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. Ample acidity lifts the medium-weight palate and rich melon, apple and toasted brioche flavors, leading into the long, lingering wood-spiced finish.",24.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
6989,Vasse Felix 2013 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Margaret River),"This bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint.

7082,Chilcas 2012 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"Largely neutral aromas touch on melon, peach and toast. This is smooth and melony on the palate, with flavors of bitter nut skins, melon, banana and papaya. A touch of bitterness rises up on the finish.",12.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079

7333,McWilliam's 2014 Cool Climate Chardonnay (Australia),"Slightly smoky grilled-toast aromas lead into a plump medium-bodied wine filled with flavors of yellow plum, tangerine and lime. It's not particularly zesty or linear in a true cool-climate fashion, but steers clear of ripe tropical fruit, ending on a gentle note of citrus pith. Drink now.",16.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
7788,Torres 2012 Milmanda Chardonnay (Conca de Barberà),"Chunky stone-fruit aromas are ripe, mature and indicative that this Chardonnay is about to start fading.

7802,Rustenberg 2006 Five Soldiers Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Spicy, earthy, assertive…this wine has character. Toast, fruit, minerality and citrus on the palate gives it a fun feel, but the wine is seriously good. Excellent for seafood or more complex Asian cuisine.",38.0,88,9,0.9996874899342079
8245,San Elias 2011 Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Chunky on the bouquet, with soft apple and melony aromas. Feels fleshy, round and a bit chunky, with white pepper, fresh-picked asparagus and melony flavors. Feels just tangy enough on the finish. Well made for under $10.",9.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079

8284,Nepenthe 2006 Unoaked Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"This wine nicely displays the fleshy pear, melon and citrus notes of unoaked Chard.

8458,Acordeón 2012 Chardonnay (Tupungato),"The nose is neutral except for dusty aromas and a hint of applesauce. This feels bold, thick and a bit clumsy, with pithy citrus, nectarine and apricot flavors. These notes continue through the wine's finish. Drink now.",9.0,83,9,0.9996874899342079
8646,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Clean, simple pear, melon and apple aromas are friendly. Reasonably full and fresh on the palate, this value-priced wine tastes of tropical fruits including banana and papaya as well as honey. A slightly oily finish gives weight to closing citrus flavors.",8.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
8700,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2009 Morse Code Chardonnay (Padthaway),"This has all the touchstones of good Chardonnay: just enough body and richness, apple, pineapple and melon fruit flavors and a crisp, citrusy finish. Solid Chardonnay for under $10.",9.0,87,9,0.9996874899342079
8704,Trapiche 2009 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish.

8757,Recanati 2014 Chardonnay (Upper Galilee),"This wine has a clean nose of grapefruit with a hint of violet. Flavors of apricot and lemon take a backseat to a strong vein of lavender. Soft on entry, it has good mouthfeel and a nice pink grapefruit splash on the finish.",17.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
8759,Ross-idi 2015 Orange Nikolaevo Vineyard Chardonnay,"This orange-style wine has a cloudy yellow-gold appearance because it spent 30 days on the skins and 100 days on the lees. It has aromas and flavors of aged apple cider and tart apple pie with an astringent finish. This style is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate orange wine made from Chardonnay, this is a solid example.",28.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
8783,Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity.

8901,Nyetimber 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 2017–2017.",70.0,95,9,0.9996874899342079

Drink now.",24.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
8972,Sidewood 2009 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"Sidewood's 2009 Chardonnay is a throwback to the sort of delicious, well-priced Chardonnays Australia used to be known for, but with a touch more class. It delivers a big blast of upfront melon and peach fruit nestled in toasted cashew-like oak, then finishes fresh and citrusy. Good value for drinking over the next 6–12 months.",26.0,89,9,0.9996874899342079
9250,Bouchard Finlayson 2009 Kaaimansgat Chardonnay (Overberg),"Wood-grilled peach aromas mingle with notes of orange blossom and almond skins on the nose.

9574,San Huberto 2010 Reserva Chardonnay (Argentina),"Perfumed aromas of lemon verbena and wild flower are reminiscent of air freshener. The palate is a bit heavy, but solid acidity provides necessary cut. Flavors of vanilla and spice are a little funky, while the finish is also oaky.",13.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
9595,Domaine Bousquet 2016 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Tupungato),"A flat luster and mild aromas of wood and almost stale fruit get this wine off to a slow start. A full palate is sketchy in terms of acidity and balance, while this tastes cidery, with a bitter flavor of grapes skins on the finish.",20.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
9750,Black Hills 2013 Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley),"Fresh and toasty, spicy and focused, this matches crisp fruit flavors of apple, citrus and pineapple to barrel-fermented grace notes.

10075,Recanati 2010 Chardonnay (Galilee),"Soft toasted-brioche and hay notes add depth to the orange rind and apple fruit center.

10110,Echeverria 2013 Classic Collection Unwooded Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),"Apple and peach aromas are dusty and lightly tropical.

10403,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2016 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Central Valley),"With almost no color, this Chardonnay smells simple and sulfuric, sort of like a match box.

10407,Ritual 2015 Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Briny aromas of green olive and popcorn lead to a flat wide palate. This tastes salty, oaky and short on fresh-fruit flavors. A plump chunky palate, much like the nose, comes across flat and low on pulse.",16.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
10432,Santa Rita 2011 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of cornbread, hay stack and tropical fruits are fairly standard for Chile.

11059,Claro 2014 Justo Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Fleshy aromas of papaya are more oaky than fruity. This is plump and mild in feel, with moderate acidity.

11306,Markus Altenburger 2016 Vom Kalk Chardonnay (Burgenland),"Reduced when first opened, this wine shows its lemony, fresh apple notes with a bit of air.

11417,Jacob's Creek 2005 Reeves Point Chardonnay (South Australia),"A few years of age have turned this South Australia Chardonnay into a highly nuanced tipple. Kerosene, hay and coconut aromas play off fragrant blood orange scents while the palate offers up toast and caramel in a tight, well-defined structure. Try with grilled salmon or serve on its own. Drinking at its peak now but will last a few more years.",28.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079

11636,Trapiche 2006 Oak Cask Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Toasty but dull, with oily walnut aromas matched by stale fruit. This is heavy and baked out; sweet and flat as a board.",11.0,81,9,0.9996874899342079
11923,Nugan Family Estates 2006 Chardonnay (Riverina),"This is unapologetically warm-climate Chardonnay, featuring tropical fruit, plenty of weight and texture and a whack of vanilla and cut-wood character. It's a broad, full-bodied wine that pulls together on the finish, ending with notes of pineapple and citrus.",13.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
11979,Ozwell Vintners 2008 Flying Piano Hand Select Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"Bursting with bold, fully ripe fruit notes of pear and peach, followed up with tropical notes, this is a lush fruit bomb of a Chardonnay to drink over the near term (3–4 months).",11.0,86,9,0.9996874899342079
12105,Element 2001 Chardonnay (Western Australia),"Smells sweet and soft, with vanilla, peach and caramel aromas. It's similar at first in the mouth; then it turns even sweeter on the finish, with caramel popcorn flavors.",14.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12109,Rosemount 2001 Hill of Gold Chardonnay (Mudgee),"A lean, toasty style that pairs dried spices—cinnamon and ginger—with zesty citrus fruits. The toast and vanilla battle green and lime flavors from the nose all the way through the finish.",17.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12110,Yalumba 2000 Chardonnay (Barossa Valley),"This relatively lean wine focuses on pear and apple aromas and flavors. Some spearmint scents spice up the nose, while buttery nuances appear on the palate. Finishes a bit short, but with crisp and clean with herb notes, unencumbered by lots of oak.",16.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12112,Ghost Gum 2000 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"A simple, lemony style that would work best with shellfish but has just enough pear and quince fruit to lend it flesh. Finishes tart and clean.",9.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12116,Logan Australia 1999 Chardonnay (Orange),"Shows promise in its lightly toasty and citrusy aromas and lemon and green-apple flavors, but tails off rapidly on the finish. It's lean and racy, obviously from a relatively cool-climate region, and should be served as you would basic Chablis, with oysters and the like.",17.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12118,Rosemount 2001 Diamond Label Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"Fits the big-production Aussie recipe to a T, blending tropical fruit, vanilla, apple and citrus flavors. It's just a little lighter than expected and finishes short.",12.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12120,Owen's Estate 1999 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"Basic Chardonnay—pear, citrus and green apple balanced by vanilla and wood. Lighter, leaner and more food-friendly than many Aussie Chards, finishing with tart acidity.",15.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12123,Penmara 2000 Chardonnay (New South Wales),"This stylish lightweight has some tasty pear, quince and citrus flavors, finishing with a hint of spice. Best as an apéritif or with a light fish course.",8.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12125,Hamelin Bay 2000 Chardonnay (Margaret River),"With a nose full of buttered popcorn and vanilla, it's clear that much if not all of this wine was barrel-fermented and aged, maybe a tad too much. The vanilla and toast flavors partially obscure pretty white peach fruit.",28.0,84,9,0.9996874899342079
12243,Bouchard Finlayson 2010 Missionvale Chardonnay (Walker Bay),"Aromas of wood-grilled peach, baked apple and sweet orange oil waft from the glass, all laced with threads of toasted oak and baking spice. The ample acidity keeps the palate lively and the finish fresh, although the woody accents dominate the close once the ripe fruit flavors subside.",30.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
12290,Siegel 2014 Crucero Collection Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Dilute, tropical aromas of banana and salami are not inviting. This has a creamy, yeasty mouthfeel and bland flavors of papaya and hot dog, with a yeasty theme on the finish.",13.0,82,9,0.9996874899342079
12295,Santa Carolina 2013 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Harsh, resiny oak aromas are devoid of fruit. This is flat, creamy and mushy in feel, with flavors of melon, powdered sugar and raw wood. The finish is resiny and candied.",11.0,82,9,0.9996874899342079
12297,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2014 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Sweaty, raw, sour aromas are harsh. The palate is flat and chunky in feel, with pithy grapefruit, nettle and bitter green flavors. Pyrazines and bitterness ride roughshod on the finish.",13.0,81,9,0.9996874899342079
12301,William Cole 2014 Albamar Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Strained and oily on the nose, this lacks freshness and fruitiness. Briny flavors are extreme and sweaty, while the finish tastes a lot like sauerkraut.",12.0,80,9,0.9996874899342079
12310,Kumeu River 2013 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu),"This shows a touch less oak than the Maté's Vineyard, with more emphasis on pineapple and citrus. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly custardy texture, and turns tangy and crisp on the finish. Drink now–2020.",45.0,91,9,0.9996874899342079
12376,West Cape Howe 2008 Unwooded Chardonnay (Western Australia),"An honest and very ripe take on Australian Chardonnay, with opulent notes of fig, pineapple and guava underscored by crisp lemon and a faint spritz that refresh the palate. The short-to-medium finish turns a bit soft. Quite likable on the whole. Try with lobster.",18.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12385,McWilliam's Hanwood Estate 2007 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"Crafted to be very broadly appealing, but well done in that category, this bottling shows ginger, toffee and malted milk scents followed by watermelon candy and fig flavors. Medium-to-full bodied, with a hint of sweetness and a finish on fast fade. Drink up.",12.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12386,Morandé 2007 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Yellow in color and chunky on the nose, which shows the common triple play of apple, banana and vanilla aromas. The palate is wide, with ample acidity and grabby, waxy flavors of orange and pineapple. Plump and soft on the finish. Drink right away or wait for the '08.",12.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12387,Rolling 2007 Chardonnay (Central Ranges),"Snap this one up for its refreshing herbal, lemon and pine-scented nose and its flavorful palate with burnt orange and pineapple tones. More refreshing and subtle than most Chardonnays in this price range, this wine is a good pick for someone who wants a dash of Old World austerity and elegance in their New World wine. Try with arctic char or coho salmon. Best drunk now but will hold a year or so.",10.0,85,9,0.9996874899342079
12507,Tapiz 2015 Alta Collection Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Floral and dusty on the nose, this Chardonnay is racy, fruity and fairly full in body.
