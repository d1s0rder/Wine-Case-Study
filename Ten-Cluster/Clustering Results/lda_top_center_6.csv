80394,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too.

53710,Boeckel 2015 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037.",38.0,95,6,0.9718713473843151
78077,Anton Bauer 2016 Rosenberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram),"The pure scent of freshly cut, ripe, green pear makes for a very appetizing, fruity nose.

All this happens on a smooth and rounded body, full of charm but with a serious, savory core.",25.0,92,6,0.9718698732645964
109772,Franz Hirtzberger 2015 Kirchweg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),An appetizing top note of candied lemon peel hovers over the glass before spicy hints of pear peel become apparent. The palate is edged with very precise zesty grapefruit hints that frame and corset a most generously white-pepper-spiced host of pear and yellow plum fruit. It is the structure of that zesty acidity that make this luminous and appetizing. This is rich but concentrated; delicious now but built to last. Drink 2017–2035.,48.0,95,6,0.9718647074443365
80401,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh.

28827,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2015 Letzenberg Riesling (Alsace),"Intense lemon and tangerine notes create a most inviting nose. The palate continues in full tangy mode: the aromatic zest of tangerine and ripe Amalfi lemon create a concentrated, uplifting and even cooling freshness. The body is slender but totally concentrated with a dynamic linear structure. Over time, riper notes of honeyed stone fruit appear despite the very dry style, but the chief charms are a marvel of citrus diversity. Drink now through 2035.",36.0,94,6,0.9709621243433917
101967,Zusslin 2013 Brut Zéro Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit.",39.0,93,6,0.9709615846899107
103275,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose.

75430,Hoffmann & Rathbone 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),"A touch of blossom honey enriches the tart but ripe apple notes of the nose. On the palate that honeyed touch turns into lemony, golden shortbread while the tart apple notes are joined by fresh, ripe lemon. Thousands of tiny, pin-prick bubbles make for a creamy, elegant mousse. The contrast between honeyed, autolytic richness and bright, pure citrus is a joy. This wine is exciting and elegant, drawing you to its mellower, richer core. The purity on the finish is luminous and long.",56.0,94,6,0.9699954054997362
88999,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2014 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast.

89004,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2014 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes.

This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last.

68986,Ebner-Ebenauer 2015 Sauberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Fresh and spicy form the first impression: ripe pear and moss, stone fruit and yeast combine to create an inviting, rounded and rich sensation.

65745,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Glorious apple freshness jumps from the glass, there is the slightest touch of honey, too. On the palate, the apple notions persist: there is fresh and baked apple, adding both crisp and mellow notes. Everything is brightened by lemony freshness on a concentrated but elegant and balanced body. Flavors last and have a long, clean and bone-dry finish. This is good enough to go the mileage.

28825,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Roche Calcaire Riesling (Alsace),"Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through.
