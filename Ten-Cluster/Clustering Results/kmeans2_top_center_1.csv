112,Mauritson 2007 Rockpile Cemetary Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.",39.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
131,Banyan 2007 Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.",17.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
229,Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello),"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
278,Claudia Springs 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
294,Lucas Vineyards 2007 Vignoles (Finger Lakes),"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.",11.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
296,Beringer 2007 Alluvium Blanc White (Knights Valley),"This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
354,Cline 2007 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (California),"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
364,McGregor 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Fresh and delicate with floral and citrus overtones, this wine has an elegant character. Its dry, spicy flavors are subtle and refreshing, giving the wine food pairing flexibility. Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
369,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Citrus and spice overtones dominate the nose of this elegant Riesling. On the palate, slightly sweet fruit flavors are balanced by mineral and spice. Pair with grilled seafood, salads and cheeses.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
693,Pax 2007 Cuvée Christine Syrah (North Coast),"A touch overripe, showing some bitter, dried raisinskin notes. If you can get past that, you'll find plenty of rich blackberry, dark chocolate, plum, beef jerky and black pepper flavors.",45.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
699,Iron Horse 2007 Ocean Reserve Sparkling (Green Valley),"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.",40.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
808,Leonesse Cellars 2007 Signature Selection Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.",70.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
880,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Viognier (Suisun Valley),"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
890,Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
892,Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",12.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
899,The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
912,Hunt Country Vineyards 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
950,Estancia 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
1147,Cosentino 2007 The Franc Cabernet Franc (California),"Soft, sweet and fruity, tasting like a granola bar, with roasted almonds, raspberry filling and cinnamon spice.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
1241,Bonterra 2007 Rosé (Mendocino County),"Bonterra's first rosé, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off.",13.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
1251,Stevenot 2007 Rosado Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus.",12.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
1370,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2007 Barrack Brand Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",42.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
1522,Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",65.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
1680,EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",25.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
1702,Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",50.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
1871,Twisted Oak 2007 River of Skulls Dalton Vineyard Red (Calaveras County),"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting Rhône blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
1889,Newsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it. The wine shows classically fine tannins, while the flavors run toward milk chocolate, ripe blackberries and lots of crushed black pepper. Delicious and refined, a great wine for peppersteak.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
1892,Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.",26.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
1893,SuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",19.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
2053,St. Francis 2007 Rowe Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",40.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
2083,Edmonds Winery 2007 Solstice Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
2650,Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",40.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2658,La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico),"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",35.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2665,Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills),"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",18.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2666,Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia),"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",23.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2670,Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2671,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",32.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
2783,Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",45.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
2790,Trefethen 2007 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",75.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
2793,Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley),"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",125.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
2814,Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",145.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
2962,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Rosé (Edna Valley),"With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors. Dry and clean, it shows California rosé near its best.",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
2994,Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
3161,Sparkling Pointe 2007 Topaz Imperial Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties. While intensely aromatic of ripe red berries and plums, it maintains an elegant dryness throughout. Rich on the palate with a soft, delicate mousse, it lingers long on an earthy, mushroom-scented finish.",33.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
3308,Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
3315,Phantom Rivers 2007 Paso del Sol Red (Central Coast),"Soft, fruity and simple, with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors. Basically dry, but tastes as sweet as jam. Syrah, Cabernet and Mourvèdre.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
3496,Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",37.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
3505,Tagaris 2007 Frank Chiullino Chef Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",55.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
3557,Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",33.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
3576,Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
3577,Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",15.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
3582,Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",36.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
3705,Beaucanon 2007 Cuvée Louis Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This wine has been in bottle a while, perhaps to round out its flavors components, which tend toward candied cherry and spice. Aged in American oak, the tannins remain tight-grained and the aromas focused, but the wine falls somewhat flat on the finish.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
3878,Alexandria Nicole 2007 Member's Only Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This appealing, southern Rhône blend is a Châteauneuf-du-Pape style, with lush, forward red fruits and pleasing traces of the estate vineyard's characteristic dusty tannins.",42.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
3889,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Suisun Valley),"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that does everything you want with this variety. It's basically dry and crisp in acidity, with polished flavors of lemongrass, pineapple tart, vanilla, buttered toast and steely minerals. Really nice wine at a great price.",13.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
3892,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The king of New York State Riesling pulls it off again. This wine opens with a gorgeous blend of mineral and fruit. The vibrant flavors follow through in the mouth with wet stones, apricot, pear and just a touch of slate. The long, elegant finish justifies every penny of the $18 price tag.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
3943,Mark Ryan 2007 Water Witch Klipsun Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Ripe red raspberry fruit fills the nose; this seems more fruit forward than most other Klipsun designates. The tannins have been wrangled into submission, giving the wine good balance immediately, while preserving the acidity and tannic depth to age well. The blend is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon and 43% Merlot—a classic, un-fussy, straight-ahead Red Mountain style.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
3948,Grand Rêve 2007 Collaboration Series III Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Syrah (Red Mountain),"Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak. Tasted shortly after its release, it still showed a bit of a liquorous new oak scent, but without turning up the heat in the finish. The fruit is young and bright, a mix of raspberry, cassis and red licorice.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
4145,Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California),"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
4152,Dierberg 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
4157,Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Riesling (Seneca Lake),"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone. Dry, but with a touch of white peach sweetness, refreshing lime juice flavors and a high toned acidity keep this wine refreshing and brisk.",13.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
4193,Klinker Brick 2007 Farráh Syrah (Lodi),"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
4337,Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",15.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
4338,Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",15.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
4340,Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley),"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",24.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
4351,Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
4441,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Syrah (Paso Robles),"Defines a certain style of Paso Robles red wine, soft in structure, with easy, gentle tannins and ripe, pronounced fruit that's almost candied in sweetness. But in this case, the blackberry and cherry flavors are totally dry.",20.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
4479,Bonair 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%.",13.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
4647,Fess Parker 2007 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",45.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
4648,J. Scott Cellars 2007 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
4790,McCrea Cellars 2007 Cuvée Orleans Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Dusty and toasty aromas over sweet plum fruit, with a streak of mocha running sharply down the center. Svelt and open, yet still sharp and showing a little bite in the back.",40.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
5012,Longboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley),"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
5066,Gary Farrell 2007 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
5106,Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
5539,Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Soft and gentle, this is a Zin to drink right now for its lush, exotic flavors. It's dry, with dusty tannins and mouth-filling tastes of ripe crushed blackberries and cherries, baked into a pie and sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper, with a pinch of salt.",25.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
5546,Daedalus Cellars 2007 Maresh Vineyard Riesling (Dundee Hills),"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months. Apples and pears, melon and grapefruit all seem to have been mixed in with wet stones; the wine makes a fresh and delicate impression with as much mineral and fruit. Stylish and lacy.",21.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
5765,Quivira 2007 Barrel Complete Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc will appeal to fans of oak. It's strong in charry, caramelized, buttered toast flavors that dominate the underlying wine, and make it taste a little sweet.",28.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
5844,Mount Pleasant Winery 2007 Bethlehem Valley Norton (Missouri),"Notes of spiced toast, Raisinets, hickory and prune mingle on the smoky, slightly baked nose. The flavors are concentrated and intense, but the baked quality is a little too distracting.",25.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
5850,Truro 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Southeastern New England),"The acidity is the prominent attribute of this wine, jutting out with little flesh to buffer its cut. Light, dusty tannins add some traction to the palate, with a leafy herb note surfacing on the short finish.",36.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
5903,Lost Canyon 2007 Trenton Station Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years.",38.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
6300,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",75.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
6396,Geyser Peak 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons.",12.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
6625,Jarvis 2007 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety on its own, but Jarvis does an excellent job. This is still quite tannic, with a hard, astringent mouthfeel to the cherry, blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors. Give this a few more years of aging, although it doesn't seem like a longterm ager.",80.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
6641,Cloudline 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),This inexpensive Pinot Gris has pear fruit with spicy highlights that somehow conjure up caraway. It's wrapped in yeasty flavors of fresh-baked bread and plenty of lemony acid.,15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
6644,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),"Honey, flower and melon leads on this delicate Riesling from Hazlitt. Juicy, full flavors of melon and citrus are balanced with a crisp minerality that lingers in the finish. Complex and energetic.",13.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
6645,Macari 2007 No 1 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"The Macari No 1 offers an aromatic nose of grapefruit and tropical fruit, followed by crisp citrus and mineral flavors.

6651,Meadowcroft 2007 Viognier (Sonoma County),"Creamy and fruity, this Viognier has forward flavors of pineapples, limes, ripe green apples, vanilla, honey and cinnamon spice, balanced with crisp acidity, and totally dry on the finish. It's an easy, enjoyable wine.",26.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
6768,Sterling 2007 SVR Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"Just lovely to drink now, it's so softly lush and decadently delicious. Beguiles the palate with jammy, pastry flavors of raspberries, cherries and sweet oak. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",50.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
6781,Bernardus 2007 Marinus Red (Carmel Valley),"Another successful Marinus from this small Monterey County appellation. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it's dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and cedar, and is more rough in tannins than your typical Napa Cabernet blend. Drink now–2013.",36.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
6785,Gnarly Head 2007 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"A soft, approachable wine whose pleasure is in its extreme dryness. Shows peppery flavors of tobacco, wild blackberries, bacon and anise.",11.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
6994,Eliseo Silva 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection.",10.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
7003,Villa San Juliette 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A big, soft, juicy Petite Sirah filled with rich flavors of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, blueberries and peppery spices. Feels voluptuous in the mouth, almost like a liquid dessert, but it's nice and dry on the finish. Good value.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
7182,Raymond 2007 Reserve Selection Merlot (Napa Valley),"Spicy and briary, almost like Zinfandel, which gives this Merlot a somewhat rustic feel. But it's rich in raspberries, cherries, currants and toast. Drink it now.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
7611,Tercero 2007 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Feels too soft and rather one-dimensional, although the flavors are very good. The best thing about the wine, aside from dryness, is the richness of tannins. The fruit veers toward blackberry marmalade and currants. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
7977,Seven Hills 2007 Pentad Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas begin with a pretty violet character, around plum and smoke. Flavors are tightly wound and balanced, with sharp acids. This slowly opens over many hours of breathing time to unveil smooth, soft fruit, light herbs, pretty floral highlights and great texture.",50.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
8072,WillaKenzie Estate 2007 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"Strong scents of grass and grapefruit leap from the glass; this could pass for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting. The flavors follow, sweetly grassy, hinting at melon and yellow fruits, with plenty of natural acids and alcohol at a moderate 13.5%.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
8092,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Juicy and fresh, this wine opens with gorgeous tropical fruit. The medium-weight palate shows sour candy flavors offset by a slight mineral edge and finishes with just enough acidity to carry off the sweetness.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
8156,Dunham 2007 Three Legged Red Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Deliciously bright and spicy, its cranberry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with pepper and cinnamon.

8279,Ballentine 2007 Pocai Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Napa Valley),"Always an interesting, exotically offbeat wine, Ballentine's '07 is particularly crisp and savory. It's showing pineapple, green apple, tangerine, fig, vanilla and honey flavors that finish with a clean, dry streak of minerality. Very nice as an alternative to Viognier or Sauvignon Blanc.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
8415,St. Supéry 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold. The acidity is very high, almost making the wine what the French call pétillant, or fizzy.",21.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
8456,Vivác Winery 2007 V. by Vivác Single Vineyard Merlot (New Mexico),"A blend of 85% Merlot, 10% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has an oxidative aroma that overrides the scents of cassis, blackberry, spiced mocha and vanilla. The medium-bodied palate feels soft and malleable, and it comes with a raisin-like edge. Finishes a bit short.",18.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
8511,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"An elegant nose of spicebox, cherry, cranberry and pepper are followed by flavors of nut, cherry, cinnamon and spice in this medium-bodied red. The wine offers structure and complexity, with an earthy, lingering finish. Pair with pork, turkey.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
8513,Lamoreaux Landing 2007 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"This notable Gewürtz starts with an aromatic, fresh fruit nose—melon, flowers—tinged with spice. On the palate, the wine offers an elegant array of white fruit, citrus and spice flavors and a shot of balancing acidity. The wine offers complexity but is also fun and refreshing, not perfumy or heavy.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
8518,Fox Run 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This lively Riesling offers aromas of citrus, apricot and honey, followed by layers of white fruit, spice and pepper. The wine has a slightly sweet fruity character but it's balanced by acid and minerals. A fun but impressive Riesling.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
8533,Château Julien 2007 Black Nova III Malbec-Syrah (Monterey County),"Extraordinarily rich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, vanilla custard, brown sugar and cinnamon spice flavors. Soft and somewhat sugary on the finish, it shows lots of ripe California fruit, but would benefit from being drier.",78.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
8701,Envy 2007 Envy Estate Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Very ripe, to the point of overripe. The blackberries and black currants veer into raisins, and there's a hint of raisinskin tartness that, combined with the strong tannins, adds to the tough mouthfeel. Will probably soften with age, without necessarily gaining complexity.",45.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
8968,McDermaid 2007 McDermaid Family Vineyard Malbec (Red Hills Lake County),"Good price for a dry, lusty Malbec that shows the variety's huge fruit, in a balanced, elegant package. While it's very tannic, the wine is softly drinkable now for its vast wealth of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors.",25.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
8977,Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",37.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
8981,Seven Hills 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Smoky and savory, with sharp acidity under black cherry fruit. It's still pulling itself together, but the weight and balance are there, showing hints of tobacco leaf, mint and herb.",22.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
9085,Due Vigne 2007 Musso Family Vineyard Dolcetto (El Dorado County),"Grown at 2,400-feet elevation from Italian budwood, this Dolcetto, so common to Piedmont but almost unheard of in California, is muy grande, with mountainous tannins and flavors of coffee and toffee and bright notes of cranberry and cherry.",19.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
9093,Cabot Vineyards 2007 Syrah (Humboldt County),"From husband-and-wife team in California redwood country, comes this interesting Syrah, sourced from dry-farmed estate vines. Smelling of cedar pine and red fruit, it's very savory, full of pepper and leather, dark coffee and espresso. Lay it down another year or so to tame its wild soul.",24.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
9376,Stottle 2007 Nebbiolo (Horse Heaven Hills),"Pure Nebbiolo from the Elerding Vineyard, aged 40 months in a mix of French and American oak. Nebbiolo does not have much color to begin with, and this seems a bit washed out, with acids and barrel flavors overtaking the fruit. Astringent and aggressively oaky.",42.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
9409,Chateau St. Jean 2007 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"Chateau St. Jean has a long history with Sauvignon Blanc, and this affordable wine shows their mastery of the variety. It's dry and crisply balanced, with delicious flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and honeysuckle that are brightened with crisp acidity. A touch of Viognier, oak and lees adds complexities that make this a great bargain.",13.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
9413,Navarro 2007 White (Mendocino),"This is a blend of Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Pinot Gris. This wine is deliciously balanced and, at this price, a super restaurant by-the-glass sipper. It's very crisp and fruity-spicy, and finishes a little sweet in honey vanilla. Nice by itself, or with Asian or Indian food.",13.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
9418,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Skyline Riesling (Monterey),"A wonderful Riesling, so polished and pretty. It was grown on the cooler western side of the Santa Lucia Mountains, where the chilly climate has kept refreshing acidity while letting the grapes fully ripen. Showing flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, yellow apricots, peaches, wildflowers and slate, it finishes with a long, fine taste of honey.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
9425,Enjoie 2007 Dry Rosé (Napa County),"A solid rosé that brings to mind bistros, steaks and pommes frites. Grenache provides the flavor background of cherries, while Barbera brings a firm spine of acidity. Finishes bone dry. A delightful and useful blush wine.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
9639,Rodney Strong 2007 Symmetry Red Meritage (Alexander Valley),"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak. The blackberry, cherry, red currant, mocha and bacon flavors are delicious, but even better is the tannic structure. It's soft and alluring enough to drink now.",55.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
10321,Bell 2007 Canterbury Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Soft in the mouth, with a somewhat simple structure, this Syrah's main virtue is flavor.

10322,Bianchi 2007 Heritage Selection Zen Ranch Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A little too harsh and raw, and there's heat from high alcohol, although there are other things to like about this Zin. It's dry and spicy, with complex wild berry, currant, cola and beef jerky flavors. The alcohol is 15.4%.",26.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
10499,Kendric 2007 Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"A rich, dry wine, soft and velvety in tannins. It feels satisfying all the way through. Not super-big in fruit, but nuanced, offering layers of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, leather and pepper. One of the finer Syrahs to come out of the Sierra Foothills this year. Ready now.",21.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
10505,Kramer 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Not sure which vineyard sourced the grapes, but this is a flavorful, ready-to-drink bottle of wine. There is substantial evidence of aging in expensive new oak barrels, with a lot of coconut flavor over toast, chocolate and cherry. Tannins are soft and the fruit is round and luscious; except for a slight fall-off in the finish this could be from any one of a number of well-known Walla Walla wineries.",28.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
10511,Nickel & Nickel 2007 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",50.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
10741,Peterson 2007 Home Farm Lipton-Daniel Vineyard Muscat Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Dark gold in color, this very sweet dessert wine has intense flavors of apricot nectar, pineapple-infused crème brûlée, vanilla frosting and butterscotch. It's rich, but balanced with a squeeze of lime acidity.",30.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
10752,Ridge 2007 Three Valleys Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"An absolutely beautiful Zin, and a must-have for restaurant wine lists. It's pure and complex in blackberries, cherries, cola and mocha, with wonderful spices erupting all the way though, and the most elegant silky texture. What a great job.",22.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
10894,Venge 2007 Penny Lane Vineyard Sangiovese (Oakville),"Sweet and jammy in cherries, with hard, angular tannins and lots of acidity. The result is awkward, but pasta primavera will help.",32.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
10898,Ridge 2007 East Bench Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Flirts with being too Porty, with superripe currant flavors that are almost raisiny. But it's dry, and the tannins are soft and yielding. Drink now.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
10900,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2007 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Strong in those feline pyrazines, so if you're sensitive, move on. Otherwise, it's a bone-dry, crisp wine, with a modest oak note to the grapefruit and lime flavors.",35.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
10912,Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Presents Rosso Red (California),"Gritty and dry, this rustic blend of Zin, Syrah and Cabernet has earthy flavors of cherries and spices. It's a fine everyday red to drink with everything from pasta or cold cuts to pizza and burgers.",10.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
11001,Schramsberg 2007 Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",41.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
11012,Schramsberg 2007 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (North Coast),"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse. It seems to boil in the glass, and the followup mouthfeel is as creamy and refined as any California sparkler in memory. The Pinot asserts itself in delicate touches of raspberries and strawberries. Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",38.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
11023,Mazzocco 2007 Briar Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A nice Zin made in Mazzocco's bold, ripe style, and since it's as good as their more expensive Zins, a comparative value. Shows massive flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice and cola, leading to a dry, somewhat hot finish.",29.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
11050,Jamesport 2007 Sidor Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Pristine black cherry and plum flavors are layered in swathes of savory dried herbs, char and coffee on this bold, big-bodied red.

11131,Page Springs 2007 La Serrana Viognier (Cochise County),"Rich orange, lemon and citrus spices lead this Viognier from Page Springs. On the palate, it's fuller bodied, with lots of spice and citrus to balance out the honeyed fruit. Pair with cheese, fruit and spicy cuisine.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
11140,Jalama 2007 Camp 4 Mourvèdre (Santa Barbara County),"A tough wine to like. Mourvèdre needs warmth, and this wine appears to have lacked enough of it to ripen. Shows an earthy, green herb and mint tug to the sweet oak and cherries. Drink now.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
11141,Lake Sonoma 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A good Zinfandel, dry, crisply acidic and rugged in tannins, with cherry-berry and spice flavors with a hint of tobacco and leather. But there's a green, vegetal streak that detracts. Drink now.`",19.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
11262,Pellegrini Vineyards 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Intensely herbaceous on the nose and palate, there's a pleasant savoriness to the concentrated red cherry and raspberry flavors in this ripe, full-bodied Cabernet Franc.

11282,St. Francis 2007 Bacchi Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Yes, it's gigantic in alcohol.

11423,Miraflores 2007 Herbert Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Very aromatic, with an elusive note of violets that adds to the attractions of the blackberries, briary wild cherries, licorice and black pepper. Full bodied and dry, this Zin is charmingly sweet in fruit and brown butter on the finish.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
11518,Balboa 2007 Sayulita Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All Pepper Bridge vineyard fruit—62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah—this is right in line with the excellent 2006 Sayulita, which came from the Lefore Vineyard. Bright fruit, tart and tangy, gives a juicy, fresh quality to the mouthfeel. Lots of high-acid berry flavors, are accented by light chocolate and caramel notes from 20 months in second and third use French oak.",40.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131

11532,Mumm Napa 2007 DVX Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley),"Crafted from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, in almost equal parts, this delicately tinted wine is subtle with flavors of strawberries, peaches and oranges.

11593,Palaia Vineyards 2007 Merlot (New York),"Hints of toast, mushroom and black coffee lend a savory, earthy tone to ruddy black cherry and plum flavors. A bit clumsy and fading on the palate, it's showing its age, so best to drink up soon.",17.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
11700,Fidelitas 2007 Red Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish.",45.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131

12007,Morgan 2007 Double L Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a fancy Syrah, the result of a small crop in this cool vintage. The flavors are concentrated in blackberries, black currants and purple plums, with cured meat and black pepper complexities. Oak adds a lush layer of smoke, vanilla and wood tannins. Complex and delicious now and through 2013.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
12078,Preston 2007 Estate Grown Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A cedary, slightly chemical aroma masks the fruit, and it is barrel flavors, more than berry flavors, that flood the palate. Overall it's a smooth, modestly-proportioned Merlot that's ready for near-term drinking.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
12334,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.",11.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
12341,JC Cellars 2007 The First Date White (California),"Sugary sweet in lemon and lime, pineapple, papaya and vanilla custard flavors, with good, balancing acidity. Basically a dessert wine. Roussanne and Marsanne.",28.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
12549,Brady Family 2007 Megandina Vineyard Vintner's Cuvée Red (Napa Valley),"This bone-dry blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is picking up aged notes, with the primary fruit flavors drying out. In its place are dried currants, cured meats, funky mushrooms. The tannins and acids provide firm structure. Already throwing some sediment, it will appeal to fans of older wines.",75.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
12550,Chandon 2007 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Mount Veeder),"There a lot of complexity on the palate of this dryish brut, with flavors of limes, raspberries, yeast, toast and vanilla. It's a tad scoury in the mouth, with a sandpapery roughness. Not an ager, so drink up.",45.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
12565,Wild Horse 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"A little coarse, with scoury tannins and sweet jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. Good for everyday, but not much going on.",18.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
12574,Spotted Owl 2007 Mountain Cuvée Red (Sonoma Valley),"The texture's all wrong on this wine, because the ripeness levels and tannins are unbalanced. The cherry and wood flavors have streaks of green and jalapeño pepper, and there's some funkiness.",30.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
12585,Arrowood 2007 Malbec (Sonoma Valley),"A bit rustic and rowdy, in the way of Malbec, with big, edgy tannins and a scour of acidity. Whatever elegance it lacks, it makes up for in the sheer power of its blackberry and coffee fruit flavors. Will probably age forever, gradually mellowing and sweetening, without ever showing much complexity.",42.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
12690,Plumb Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Drink this while it is still showing its youthful fruit. Black and purple berries abound, with excellent depth, some herbal grace notes and a spicy, lengthy finish.",24.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
12692,Watermill 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This tasty effort has very tart red fruit set in sharp acids, with highlights of spices and seeds. Still quite young, with the acidity and structure to improve over the next few years.",28.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131

12871,Page Springs 2007 La Serrana Viognier (Cochise County),"Rich orange, lemon and citrus spices lead this Viognier from Page Springs. On the palate, it's fuller bodied, with lots of spice and citrus to balance out the honeyed fruit. Pair with cheese, fruit and spicy cuisine.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
13044,Betz Family 2007 La Serenne Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.",55.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
13045,Gary Farrell 2007 Bradford Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A complex, sophisticated Zinfandel, although it's very young, and all the parts haven't come together. Shows luscious waves of ripe forest blackberries, raspberries, red plums and nectarines, with notes of dry chocolate, sweet tobacco, balsam and cedar, finished with massive peppery spices. Notable for the purity and elegance of its tannin-acid structure, this beautiful Zinfandel should age well through 2014.",40.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
13089,Patit Creek Cellars 2007 Roux Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"About half Cabernet, the rest a Bordeaux mix, this opens nicely with forward plum and cherry fruit. There are notes of savory herbs in the nose, but the wine turns astringent and the finish a little chalky and stemmy.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
13094,IL Gioiello 2007 Triumphe Red (Amador County),"Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
13238,Raphael 2007 La Tavola Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This is a reserved and elegant example, fashioned along European lines. There's mixed vegetable and tomato notes upfront and a juicy palate of red fruit rounded out by a vanilla top note. The medium finish shows soft tannins. Serve with firm cheese. Drink now to 2011.",11.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13243,Alderbrook 2007 Three Goose Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"There's some sharpness throughout this Zinfandel. The palate wishes it were smoother and more harmonious, especially since the flavors are very rich, suggesting ripe blackberries and blueberries, picked under a warm summer sun, as well as black pepper and mocha. Ready now.",34.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13245,Boomtown 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A tiny bit of Mourvèdre and Barbera are added into the blend, but this is honest and true to varietal Washington Syrah, with strawberry and cherry candy fruit flavor in abundance. Initially forward and light on the palate, it moves into more herbal, earthy flavors in the finish.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13246,Calcareous 2007 Trés Violet G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Thick and unctuously soft, this southern Rhône-style blend is rich in blackberry jam, chocolate, licorice and bacon flavors, with a coating of smoky oak. It's quite decadent, but could use greater structure.",34.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13342,Bodegas Paso Robles 2007 Viva Tu! Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"This 100% Tempranillo is soft and silky and vibrant in acidity, with pretty flavors of red cherries, raspberries and bacon. A nice wine to drink now with ham, sausage and similar salty, umami-rich fare.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13345,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 178 Syrah (Los Carneros),"Some producer in Carneros didn't want the wine that went into this negociant's ‘07 Syrah, to judge by its quality. Lucky for Cameron Hughes. It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a very great value.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13360,Pomar Junction 2007 Syrah (Monterey County),"This wine comes from the San Lucas area of the southern Salinas Valley, on the way toward Paso Robles.

13470,Peju 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a lovely red wine, soft and appealing, and perfect for drinking now. It's dry and silky in tannins, with intricately layered cherry, smoked meat, pepper and sandalwood flavors.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
13533,Columbia Winery 2007 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Some diesel and cracker on the nose, along with the usual Gewürztraminer mix of citrus and soap. The fruit is substantial and fills out the midpalate, offering peaches, apricots, suggestions of papaya and some crisp, apple acids. In keeping with past vintages, this new release is finished at just under 3% residual sugar. It should stand up nicely to spicy noodle dishes.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
13592,Schramsberg 2007 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"This gorgeous, full-bodied and compelling wine is made from 84% Chardonnay and 16% Pinot Noir. It has a rich golden color, slightly earthy aromas, plus bread dough and white-peach scents that lead to very opulent, sophisticated and nicely aged flavors that range from toasted walnut to honeyed peach to white pepper. While it's already nine years old, this will easily age through 2022.",120.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
13724,Diamond Ridge Vineyards 2007 2 Jakes Red Blend Red (Clear Lake),"2 Jakes smells sweet and alcoholic at first, then veers left with cranberry aromas, veers right with a pinch of cola and finishes tannic. Keep the food fatty and simple and it'll go well.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
13915,Reininger 2007 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Pure Syrah from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Ash Hollow vineyard fruit, this shows the maturing of Walla Walla vines, which more and more reveal the earthy, herbal, garrigue qualities of the grape. Coopered in neutral oak, it showcases the typicity and regionality of the grape. Funk, earth, seaweed, green tobacco, and a hint of pepper dominate. You might wish for more fruit, but for those who love the funk this is a fine bottle.",41.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
14169,Carivintas 2007 Hobo Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),"Lots of blackberry, cherry, smoked meat and pepper spice flavors in this dry, tannic Petite Sirah. It's a little harsh in texture, so drink it with rich barbecue and roasted meat dishes.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
14360,Dogwood 2007 Meritage (Mendocino),"A Meritage that's 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 50% Merlot, this wine is all leathery pouch—still chewy but with lots of well-intentioned structure and big blackberry flavor.",40.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
14622,Robert Hall 2007 Hall Ranch Rosé de Robles Rosé (Paso Robles),"Reminiscent of a good southern French rosé, this blush of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Cinsaut is dry, crisp and minerally. It has subtle, complex flavors of rose petals, herb tea, cherry skins, anise, cloves and lavender, and is quite complex, especially considering the price.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
14637,Maddalena 2007 Riesling (Monterey),"With 4.5% residual sugar, this Riesling falls into the shadowy realm between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. You could have it with trout almondine or with a fruit tart. Either way, it's crisp in acidity, with complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, pineapples, peaches, pears, buttercup flowers, honey and cinnamon spice. It's also a good buy.",13.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
14799,Jasper 2007 Seyval Blanc (Iowa),"Sweet butter and caramel notes linger amidst smoke and char on this unabashedly oaky, full-bodied Iowa Seyval Blanc. Savory pressed apple flavors are pleasant but subdued.",16.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
14830,Corliss Estates 2007 Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Smooth and textured, this is a supple, lightly earthy and aromatic Bordeaux-style blend. The principal components are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. One gets the feeling that the winery was still finding its way during production; this was made by a winemaker no longer at Corliss. Berry, plum, fig, dried herb and cedar are all in the mix—it's more genteel than generous.",65.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
15077,Waterbrook 2007 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Clean, crisp and dry, this gentle rosé has a light and pretty strawberry candy color and the flavors follow right along, with a citrusy snap in the acids.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
15146,Twisted Oak 2007 Parcel 17 Red (Calaveras County),"A robust wine with strong, complex flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, grilled meat, bacon and plenty of peppery spices. A bit forward and unsubtle, but deliciously dry, with smooth, dusty tannins and a cut of acidity. Seems at its best now with rich fare like lamb. Mourvèdre, Carignane and Graciano.",32.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
15147,Whitehall Lane 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Super-delicious, a soft, luscious wine whose cherry, raspberry and cocoa flavors are wrapped into velvety tannins. Made even richer by the vanilla and toasty caramel of oak barrels. Defines ready-to-drink Napa Valley Merlot.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
15195,Brandborg 2007 Gewürztraminer (Umpqua Valley),"Brandborg really knocks it out of the park with this Gewürztraminer, the strongest in a very solid lineup of white wines. It perfectly captures the oily, floral essence of the grape, in a dense, focused wine loaded with citrus oil, Key lime, and tropical fruits. Great length and balance, as with all the Brandborg white wines.",16.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
15935,Bray 2007 Rosato Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"With a slight sweetness to the raspberry, cherry, pink grapefruit, clove and pepper flavors, this blush is balanced by crisp, citrusy acidity.

16187,Spring Valley Vineyard 2007 Katherine Corkrum Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003.

16190,Olsen Estates 2007 Petite Verdot (Yakima Valley),"There are few varietal Petit Verdots in Washington, and even fewer pure varietals such as this, which goes right to the front of the pack. The fruit is sweet, tangy, grapey and young, with plum and cassis filling out the midpalate. The acids are juicy and natural, and the tannins—often aggressive and herbal with this grape—are polished and smooth.",37.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
16274,Cooper Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"Aromas of vanilla, cherry and cola start this impressive Cabernet Franc from Cooper. On the palate, pepper, cherry and spice is balanced and assertive. A lingering finish of cedar and plum adds to the appeal.",17.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
16277,Mendielle Vertu 2007 Proprietary Red Merlot (Mendocino County),"Tannic and fruity, with the taste of an energy bar. The flavors suggest ripe blackberries, anise, almonds, honey, pepper and dark chocolate. Drink now.",27.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
16357,Chateau Lettau 2007 Rockstar Red (Monterey County),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this has firm tannins and ripe, forward flavors of blackberries, currants and oak. Already throwing some sediment, it will continue to soften and mellow over the next 5–6 years.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
16416,Midnight 2007 Capriccio Italien Red (Paso Robles),"Way too ripe, with raisined flavors, including raisin-skin bitterness and alcholic heat on the finish. The dominant variety is Sangiovese.",34.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
16620,St. Francis 2007 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A strong Zinfandel, tannic, high in alcohol and fruity, and brimming with wild forest cherry and raspberry liqueur, exotic spices and sweet sandalwood.

16621,Star Angel by Montes 2007 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soft and simple, with herb-infused blackberry, cherry, cola, beef jerky and pepper flavors. Finishes dry and nicely spicy, but needs greater structure, especially at this price.",35.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
16632,Flocchini 2007 Saddle Up Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Soft and already easy to drink, this exhibits California ripeness, and it offers cherry pie, chocolate and red licorice flavors.",22.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
16698,Soos Creek 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape is Cab Franc (11%). The vineyard's characteristic lush black cherry fruit is surrounded by even darker components: earth, balsamic, baking chocolate, and espresso. There's an interesting walnut flavor (from the barrels?) and the fruit threads through to the very end of a long finish, supported by firm acids.",33.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
16701,Olsen Estates 2007 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"A strong effort from Olsen Estates, this 100% Syrah has fine varietal character, in a rough and tumble style. Cured meats, herbs, earth and hints of sea salt mingle with the wild berry fruit flavors. It's balanced and fresh, with lingering and nuanced flavors threading through the gulpable finish.",29.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
16706,Coho 2007 Headwaters Red (Napa Valley),"Impressively flashy, an opulent wine that immediately offers a blast of blackberries, cherries, currants, red licorice and cedar. But it's quite astringent in tannins. Age this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend for 5–7 years.",40.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
16709,JR Wine 2007 George's Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Big, rich, extracted and just beautiful. It's a high-octane Zin, with high alcohol and ripe, spicy flavors, making it a classic example of its type. Just massive in blackberries, black cherries, beef teriaki, cola, pepper, Indian spices and sandalwood. Drink this decadently good wine from now–2013.",32.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
16711,Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors. The sweetness is neither cloying nor syrupy—rather, it neatly laces the wine together.",20.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
16720,O•S Winery 2007 Klipsun Vineyard S White White (Red Mountain),"Winemaker Bill Owen (the ‘O' in O•S) has a knack for making white wines from red wine vineyards. This pungent, ripe, stylish Sauvignon Blanc/Sémillon blend is a fine example. The fruit flavors are thick and juicy— pineapple, golden apple, citrus—and the herbaceous nature of the grape has been transmuted into a sweet grassy streak, supported with mouth-searing acids. It's a roller-coaster ride, and delicious all along the way.",20.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
17204,SKN 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a good, everyday-style Merlot. It's dry and medium-bodied, with pleasant flavors of black cherries, black currants and oak, finished with a savory edge of tannins. Shows class beyond its price.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
17209,Mantra 2007 Old Vines Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Hot, dry and ripe, with strong flavors of grilled blackberries and cherries, red and black currants, tobacco, cocoa and peppery spices.

17218,Vinifera 2007 Niveus White (Napa Valley),"A pretty wine that shows elegance in its structure. Mostly Sauvignon Blanc, with a splash of Sémillon, it's not truly dry, with a sweetly jammy finish. Shows oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie, honeysuckle and vanilla.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
17266,Burgess 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A bit rugged in texture, with some jagged tannins, but the blackberry and cherry fruit is just fine, and the finish is dry and complex. Decant this young wine for a few hours to take the edge off.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
17328,Millésimé 2007 Bleu Saphir Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"At the age of nearly six years, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend remains deliciously fresh, offering ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, chocolate and oak flavors. It's soft in tannins, which limits ageability, although it's already throwing some sediment. Drink over the next two years.",58.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
17405,Mazzocco 2007 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Super-fruity, offering a blast of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, persimmons, red plums and bacon, finished with enormous spices.

17412,Dogwood 2007 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A bit too soft and sweet, with candied flavors of black cherries, chocolate and anise biscotti. Certainly offers lots of richness, but could use greater structure.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
17426,Ledson 2007 Barbera (Sonoma Valley),"Classic old-fashioned California Barbera. It's super-dry, hard in tannins and high in acidity.

17532,V. Sattui 2007 Black-Sears Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",40.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
17539,Cardinal Zin 2007 Beastly Old Vines Zinfandel (California),"Grown in the Oakley area from (mostly) old vines, this Zin is dry, lush in texture and complex in flavors.

17745,Mauritson 2007 Buck Pasture Red (Rockpile),"Big, big, big! This is a mountain-grown Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's tremendous all around. Explodes in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants, cherries and mocha, and the tannins are strong, but refined. Combines elegance and power, and should develop over the next 6–8 years.",50.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
17803,Topel 2007 Estate Blend Red (Mendocino),"A well-crafted blend of estate-grown Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, this shows the bright-red cranberry fruit of the Cabernet and the spicy, meaty length of the Syrah.

19216,RustRidge 2007 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"With rich tiers of blackberries, cherries, currants and sandalwood, this Petite Sirah also has a salt and pepper meatiness to it, like a great hamburger. Its sturdy tannins will play well with roasts. Should hold for some years, but if you open it now, give it plenty of time to breathe.",35.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
19231,Magness 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A little tough and gritty in the mouth, but the flavors are rich, and the wine finishes long and spicy. Underneath the edgy tannins is plenty of black cherry, currant and plum fruit. Drink now.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
19239,Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Superrich and ripe, flooding the mouth with jammy flavors of raspberries, cherries, anise and pepper.

19241,Stella Fino 2007 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 100% Sangiovese has interesting aromatics, with a pine ester high note over the light strawberry-scented fruit. There is an earthy underpinning; overall a pleasant quaffer with a bit more heft than the winery's other reds.",21.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
19242,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Malbec (Livermore Valley),"The aroma of charred oak dominates this Malbec, while oak tannins rule the palate. The underyling wine is soft and fruity and tannic in itself, with blackberry and currant flavors. Big and hefty, it's a wine to drink with superrich fare, like barbecue or meat stews.",50.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
19243,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Verdot (Livermore Valley),"A good wine, not a great one, that shows why Petit Verdot on its own is hard to make into a complete wine, although from a marketing point of view, it has a certain tale to tell. Midnight dark in color, bone dry and big in tannins, it has flavors of blackberries, blueberries and oak.",50.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
19341,Fenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"A rich, full Petite Sirah with a taste of cola and spice followed by ripe raspberry and blackberry. A very yummy version of the variety from one of Livemore's most promising vineyards.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
19345,Brassfield 2007 High Serenity Ranch Pinot Grigio (High Valley),"If you like a little sugary sweetness in your white wines, this is a good one.

19346,Brassfield 2007 Serenity White (High Valley),"This is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewürztraminer and Semillon. It's nicely crisp in acids, with sweet, jammy pineapple, apricot, peach, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Good with Asian fare, or with fresh fruit.",15.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
19347,Andretti 2007 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Firm, chewy tannins and jammy black cherry flavors mark this dry red wine. It has nuances of currants and anise. Needs oily meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness.",39.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
19349,Snow Farm 2007 Icewine Vidal Blanc (Vermont),"Luscious aromas of lemon, sweet orange and honey are followed by a burst of honey, orange and spice in this indulgent dessert wine.

19353,Dancing Bull 2007 Zinfandel (California),"Has some overripe flavors of raisin skins, with bitter tannins, but the wine is fully dry, with enough black currant, coffee, black licorice and plum flavors to satisfy. Barbecue will be a perfect partner for this affordable Zin.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

19518,Yorba 2007 Shake Ridge Vineyards Syrah (Amador County),"Viticulturalist Ann Kraemer, who farms Shake Ridge Vineyards for many other producers, keeps some of the grapes for Yorba, her label with winemaker Ken Bernards of Ancien. The result is an exceptionally good dark plum, black cherry and blackberry-tinged Syrah with pepper and meat thread throughout the deep fruit concentration of this still-tight, mountain-grown wine. Cellar another 2–5 years.",32.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
19521,Tranche 2007 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The soft but flavorful entry into a land of dark fruits, smoke and espresso barely hints at the wine to come. Give it time to breathe and it opens into a wonderfully complex, smooth and creamy wine with no rough edges. Pretty red fruit, seductive and lingering, is matched to hints of chocolate from 30 months in neutral barrels.",25.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
19581,Vina Robles 2007 Jardine Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest. With citrus, lemongrass, melon, fig and vanilla flavors, it's a stunning buy for this price.",14.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
19596,McConnell Estates Winery 2007 Wackman Ranch Merlot (Lodi),"This very fairly priced Merlot from the Cosumnes River sub-section of Lodi has a juicy berry roundness that makes it inviting to drink, and softly textured all around. On the long finish is a remarkably vibrant strain of caramel-mocha flavor, and interesting secondary notes that may have developed over time on this 2007 vintage.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
19735,Boudreaux Cellars 2007 Merlot (Washington),"This has a lovely entry that explodes with scents of toasted almond and espresso. The black cherry and sour plum flavors command your attention, with texture and balance throughout. Drink soon.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131

19811,Mosby 2007 Cortese (Santa Barbara County),"A little heavy and soft for a white wine, but shows true dryness and some interestingly earthy flavors of white tobacco, herbs and citrus fruits. Promising, but needs greater structure and complexity.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
19814,Sauvignon Republic 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"With no oak influence at all, this stainless steel-fermented and aged young wine is crisp and clean in vibrant acidity.

19819,Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache Rosé (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry to slightly off-dry and wonderfully crisp in acidity, this rosé has spicy cherry, herb and vanilla flavors, with no oak influences at all.",17.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
19826,Blackstone 2007 Rubric Sonoma Reserve Red (Sonoma County),"The blend is Bordeaux grapes with a few other varieties. The wine is ripe in blackberry, chocolate and herb flavors that are very good, but the structure is harsh, the tannins are hard and the finish is sharp.",23.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
19828,Hearthstone 2007 Lodestone Estate Grown G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Very dry and rather sharp in fruit-skin acidity, with a tart bite to the cherries, cola and licorice. A good, rustic wine for drinking now.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
19829,Verge 2007 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A tough, gritty wine, with hard, scoury tannins and the kind of brambly, briary wild berry flavors you might find in a Zinfandel. Finishes with peppery, sandpapery roughness. Might develop in the bottle, but it's a gamble.",40.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
19837,Eagle Castle 2007 Barbera (Paso Robles),"Dry, acidic and tannic, in the manner of a young Barbera, but the flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants aren't powerful enough to outlast the astringency. Drink this tough, rustic wine now.",35.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
19838,Emmolo 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Tastes too over-oaked for what you get. There are modest cherry-berry flavors, but the wine is dominated by smoky char, caramel and butterscotch. Ready now.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
20019,Sausal 2007 Century Vines Estate Grown Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Very rich, extracted and soft in tannins and acids, a melt-in-your-mouth Zin with almost sweet flavors of milk chocolate, crushed ripe cherries, licorice, caramelized wood and oodles of black pepper. Should develop over the next 4–6 years.",40.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
20382,Wagner 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Lively and fresh with a floral and lemon citrus character in the nose and on the palate, this full-bodied Gewürtz offers lovely aromas and full-bodied flavors.

20425,Brass Tacks 2007 Merlot (Central Coast),"Bone dry, with brisk tannins, this is a Merlot to drink with good food and not worry about the wine overshadowing it. It's really drinkable, with a soft, lush mouthfeel and flavors of cherries, currants, spices and cedar. A huge and welcome improvement over the '06.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131

Feels fancy in the mouth, and might pick up some bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",60.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
20436,Fidelitas 2007 Champoux Vineyard Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Champoux is one of Washington's most revered vineyards, known especially for the rich, black cherry fruit on display here. However, this wine seems to be aging rather quickly, the flavors turning soft and leafy in the midpalate, and the wine's rim hinting at the beginning tones of brick. It's drinking nicely, and should be consumed near term for best enjoyment.",50.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
20438,Albeno Munari 2007 Tempranillo (Calaveras County),"A very delicious wine, rich in fruits and spices, and easy to drink for its softness. Shows cherry, mocha, licorice, black pepper and sweet, smoky oak   flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Ready now.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
20756,XYZin 2007 10 Vine Age Series Zinfandel (California),"Jammy and fruity-sweet, with peppery raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, offset by rich, dusty tannins. A sound, everyday Zin that will love gooey cheese melted on almost anything.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

20831,Justin 2007 Isoceles Red (Paso Robles),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit. Smoky oak plays a crucial role, in both flavors and texture. It's a very pretty, polished wine, elegant and balanced and ready to drink now. Production was a hefty 11,000 cases.",62.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
20913,Terry Hoage 2007 The Pick Red (Paso Robles),"Feels a bit one-dimensional now, showing fruit and oak sweetness and ripe, forward cherry pie and spice flavors. Could age, but the simple structure suggests otherwise. Drink this southern Rhône-style blend now.",40.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
21040,Fortress 2007 Petite Sirah (Red Hills Lake County),"A beautiful Petite Sirah, and a serious player. Shows the classic balance and elegance of a fine red wine, with smooth tannins framing the variety's wildly exotic flavors of blackberries, blueberries, bacon, tobacco, grilled mushrooms, tamari, anise and lots of black pepper. Great now with BBQ, and should evolve in interesting ways for many years.",35.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
21231,Volatus 2007 Topgun Cuvée Red (Paso Robles),"This is a whopper of a wine, thanks to the high alcohol and long aging, with aromas of caramelized blueberries, black-cherry syrup and concentrated lilacs. The palate is thick with fudge and blackberry-jam flavors, with a decent energy cutting through the brooding tar and pipesmoke character.",25.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
21430,Trentadue 2007 Petite Sirah (North Coast),"Break out the barbecue for this lusty, tannic, rustic Petite Sirah. It's thick and fruity and dry, with blackberry, currant, leather and spice flavors.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21431,Unti 2007 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Grenache is a terribly hard variety to make on its own. It's better used as a blender, which this wine proves. It's dry and silky, with one-dimensional cherry, blueberry and oak flavors. Drink now.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21434,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast),"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21437,Fritz 2007 Estate Grown Late Harvest Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Could and should be sweeter than 3.9% residual sugar to justify being a dessert wine. Teases with somewhat sweet blackberry, chocolate and pepper flavors that pull back to a tannic, earthy finish.",35.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21441,Camaraderie 2007 Cabernet Franc (Washington),"Sharp, tart berry flavors come in cleanly, but the wine hits a chalky wall midpalate and refuses to open up. Re-tasted after 24 hours, it hadn't budged.",28.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21443,Chaddsford 2007 Merlot (Pennsylvania),"A good honest Merlot, with vanilla, spice cake and woodsy scents followed by cherry pie flavors and a medium finish of ash and green pepper. This is a subtle and restrained wine that should appeal to fans of Bordeaux. Drink now.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21448,Three Fox 2007 Piemontese Nebbiolo (Virginia),"Nebbiolo has proved to be an enormously difficult grape to grow outside of a few small areas in Northern Italy, but Three Fox Vineyards has done an admirable job. There's pleasant strawberry fruit here with an earthy underpinning of fresh tar. In the mouth, Nebbiolo's trademark grippy tannins proved a backdrop for intense, cherry fruit. Give the tannins a few years to mellow out, then serve with London broil.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21453,Tre 2007 Merlot (California),"Some good currant, cherry, cola and licorice flavors in this dry, balanced wine. It's one of the better Merlots out there at this affordable price.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
21608,Keuka Spring 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"A bright, fresh nose of citrus and flowers, followed by floral flavors balanced by good acid, gives this wine a flirty character.

21930,Keller Estate 2007 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp in acidity and delicious, with honeyed flavors of pineapples, green apples, Meyer lemons, vanilla and peppery spices. Finishes a bit sugary sweet, which detracts from pure balance.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
21998,Longoria 2007 Evidence Red (Santa Barbara County),"Pinot maestro Longoria continues to try his hand at Bordeaux blends despite the uphill challenge. This '07 is a Cab Franc-based bottling. It's uneven, with cherry pie filling flavors, edgy tannins and unintegrated sweet, caramelized oak. There's even a bit of heat from high alcohol. Ready now.",38.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
22004,Castle Rock 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A little overripe and underripe around the edges, with mint and plumped raisin flavors framing the black cherries and cedar. Good, but rustic, and ready now.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
22009,Cycles Gladiator 2007 Merlot (California),"Doesn't have quite the concentration of many more expensive Merlots, but fills a nice niche in an affordable red wine that's full-bodied, dry and elegant. Offers pleasant flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and oak.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
22012,Frick 2007 Gannon Vineyard Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),"Tastes sweet and honeyed in pineapple and lemon Lifesaver candy, with a sharp cut of acidity that tastes almost unnatural. Feels overly manipulated, but will appeal to lots of people.",27.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

22432,Mumm Napa 2007 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"A 50-50 sparking blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes given more time in bottle, the DVX is light golden in color. Yeasty on the nose and dry on the palate, it offers a flurry of rich, full-bodied apple and wild berry layered atop a thick layer of minerality.",60.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
22468,John Tyler 2007 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Sweet, soft and delicious, this is a rich Zinfandel to savor with barbeque. It's tasty in blackberry, cherry and blueberry fruit, with a coating of smoky oak. Earns extra points for a long, exotically spicy finish. Great now and over the next four years.",38.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
22555,Pacific Rim 2007 Chenin Blanc (Washington),"Pacific Rim is a Riesling specialist, but makes a limited amount of Chenin Blanc; clearly a labor of love. Rare attention is given to this sadly degraded tasting room grape; here it has a chance to express more of its thrilling complexity. Bone dry and loaded with lemon, grapefruit and melon fruit, this adds floral hints and sweet hay in the nose, while balancing its young, leesy flavors with bright acids.",11.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
22569,Forth 2007 Sanford Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"This is a polished and savory Sauvignon Blanc whose very sightly sweet lemongrass and spearmint flavors are finely balanced with crisp acidity.

22601,Jamesport 2007 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Intensely concentrated red cherry aromas are accented with a delicate leafiness in this rich, robust Cab Franc. It's a powerful, juicy, boldly textured wine with a bit of heat on the finish, but stays fresh on the palate thanks to a vibrant spray of acidity.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
22690,Chimney Rock 2007 Elevage Blanc White (Napa Valley),"A white Bordeaux-style wine based on Sauvignon Blanc, it shows upfront citrusy flavors of pineapples and limes, enriched with the vanilla and smoke of oak. Could be a little drier and more complex, but pretty good.",42.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
22698,Alexandria Nicole 2007 Lemberger (Horse Heaven Hills),"A good, hearty, substantial Lemberger, brimming with plush boysenberry fruit dotted with black pepper. It's broadly tannic, certainly one of the best Lems in Washington.",30.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
22706,Ridge 2007 Geyserville Red (Sonoma County),"Made from Zinfandel, Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mataro (Mourvèdre), this hearty wine currently is sweet and full in primary cherry, blackberry, plum and cedar flavors, with a touch of raisins in the finish. It should slowly develop over the next 4–6 years before heading inexorably downhill.",35.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
22917,Yorba 2007 Shake Ridge Red Red (Amador County),"A dark, brooding showcase of many of Shake Ridge Vineyards's finest varieties mixed into one inviting bottle. With 31% Syrah, 28% Primitivo, 18% Petite Sirah, 10% Mourvèdre, 7% Malbec and 6% Merlot, this wine has baked plum and dark bright cherry predominantly, followed by a grip of tobacco and cinnamon spice.

23057,Fenestra 2007 Conjugation Red (Livermore Valley),"Opening with a mouthful of dusty raspberry and cherry flavors, this Bordeaux blend of a little more than half Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers much in the way of inviting fruit and spice notes. Its pleasing acidity lasts through the finish.",40.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
23058,Fenestra 2007 Tourvanillo Silvaspoons Vineyard Reserve Red (Lodi),"Another Fenestra-Silvaspoons collaboration, Tourvanillo is a proprietary blend of Iberian grapes, predominantly Touriga, and is marked mostly by its aromatic highlights of spicy cinnamon and vibrant currant. Dense, it is interesting and intense with rounded edges and a leathery, long finish.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
23253,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinotage (Sonoma Coast),"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak.

23321,Viento 2007 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This is the first Grüner fruit from Underwood Mountain, and it promises good—maybe great—things to come. Sleek and stony, the wine epitomizes the racy, slightly grassy, slightly peppery quality of classic Austrian Grüner, with a Pacific Northwest twist—a certain brilliant intensity to the fruit that reflects this northern latitude. Clearly the best Grüner from Oregon or Washington to date.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
23329,Sineann 2007 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This Oak Ridge bottling is rich and unctuous. Scents and flavors of rose petals mingle with a lightly soapy, oily, broad midpalate that floats along on a bed of flowers, stone fruits, toast, hazelnuts, caramel and stone. A splash of everything, but it comes together in a seductive, open framework with just enough acid to support it.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
23357,Sineann 2007 Hillside Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (OR)),"A big wine for Merlot, this high alcohol (14.6%) effort ramps up its black cherry fruit with volatile acidity and brings in chocolaty barrel flavors under an earthy, tannic finish. Another year or two in the bottle can only help; at this young age it seems a little blowsy and sharp.",30.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
23363,Brandborg 2007 Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),"In much the same style as Brandborg's Riesling, this creamy Pinot Gris has a rich, leesy texture, here augmented with streaks of vanilla and toasted almond.

23399,Gård 2007 Lawrence Vineyards Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach.

Easy to like, yet complex.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23404,Dusted Valley 2007 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As with all Dusted Valley wines, the focus is on varietal purity, and the careful blending (an addition of 10% Merlot) enhances it, by expanding the midpalate and adding complexity. Green coffee and oak-driven coconut and vanilla custard flavors dominate, with dark fruits holding down center court.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23409,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Grand Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23410,Coastview 2007 North Block Syrah (Monterey County),"A rich, full-bodied and dry Syrah that shows fine terroir. It comes from an area, in the Gabilan Mountains of Monterey, that does not yet have a sub-appellation, but should. The wine is effusive in blackberries, black currants, mocha, pepper and cedar, with a sweetly exotic note of foie gras. Now–2012.",29.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23411,DaMa 2007 Cowgirl Cab Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.",21.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23412,Sparkman 2007 Outlaw Merlot (Red Mountain),"From Klipsun and Hedges fruit, this muscular, aromatic Merlot begins with pretty berry scents, then develops flavors of currant and cherry. It's a wine with meat and muscle, still packed tight, but dense with potential. Give it plenty of decanting, or cellar it for five years.",42.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23413,Sparkman 2007 Ruby Leigh Red Red (Red Mountain),"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb. The length and detail bespeak a wine with medium-term aging potential. Baking spices dominate the finish, with a burst of heat from the near-15% alcohol.",42.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23418,Trentadue 2007 Block 500 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A really nice Merlot, and look at that price. It's dry, elegant and entirely balanced, with a rich earthy texture. Shows classic flavors of black cherries, black currants, violets, anise and sweet sandalwood. Terrific value.",14.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23421,Passalacqua 2007 Maple Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A bright, cheerful and very well-crafted Zinfandel that shows a deft touch at handling this variety's challenges. Achieves thorough ripeness, with blackberry, black currant, cola and pepper flavors, even as the alcohol is kept moderate, and the finish is dry and smooth.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23529,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Mancini Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
23794,William Hill Estate 2007 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Needs time in the cellar, as it's really tough in tannins now. Feels hard and sandpapery and raspingly dry. Deep down inside is a molten core of ripe blackberries and black currants, with lots of new, smoky oak. Seems to be your classically ageable Napa red. Give it until at least 2013, and it could surprise and delight for many years beyond.",125.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
23795,Quilceda Creek 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.",35.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
23806,Tamarack Cellars 2007 DuBrul Vineyard Reserve Red (Rattlesnake Hills),"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds.",45.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
23813,J. Bookwalter 2007 Foreshadow Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol.",36.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
23826,Rulo 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy, minty and sharp, this has a Sancerre-like edge, but with an extra weight to the fruit that is more reminiscent of like a South African Sauvignon Blanc. It's packed with green pea, herb, lemon and lots of citrusy flavors, all set against very sharp, bright but delicious natural acids.",15.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
23828,McCrea 2007 Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc White (Yakima Valley),"The blend is 37% Marsanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 20% Picpoul and 10% Roussanne. Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. The stony, textural underpinning adds a lot of depth while the fruit mixes citrus and melon with hints of just-ripe green banana and papaya. It's a juicy yet subtle wine, with aging potential over the next half decade or so.",28.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
23832,Chandler Reach 2007 Dessert Wine Viognier (Yakima Valley),"This was picked at the same time as the regular Viognier, but fermentation was stopped, leaving it as a sweet wine (about 4.8% r.s.). The fruit is laced with honey, lime and apricot; it's delicious without being cloying.",27.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24024,Domenico 2007 Primitivo (Amador County),"Thick and heavy, this is Port-like in its toffee and raisin aromas, with a trace of licorice in the background. Its syrupy consistency almost expresses an air of oxidation.",30.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
24183,Novy 2007 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Sonoma Mountain),"A bit heavy and jammy-rich, with cherry pie filling, raspberry and red currant flavors. Oak adds the usual smoky, spicy notes. Drink now.",27.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
24267,Mark Ryan 2007 Crazy Mary Ciel du Cheval Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Mourvèdre/Syrah blend has loads of wild berry and black cherry, spiced up with tarragon and other herbs. The Syrah fills in the middle with juicy berry and peppery spice. The tannins are balanced and firm, barky but not overpowering.",48.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24271,Girard 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"An appealing Cab Franc, among the better versions of the variety. Shows the weight and structure of a fine Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, except the flavors veer toward red cherries and red cherry liqueur. Drink now, with honey-baked ham.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24329,Clos La Chance 2007 JoLi Estate Vineyard Meritage (Central Coast),"Ripe and powerful in blackberry, cherry, cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a spicy finish, this blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, also is potent in tannins. It's a complex, nuanced wine, but is really too astringent for current consumption. Give it at least six years and try again.",50.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
24485,Château Julien 2007 Private Reserve Merlot (Monterey County),"Nice to see such a nice Merlot from Château Julien, their best ever. It does what Merlot should, being dry and lush, with complex sour cherry, currant, herb, cocoa and spice flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. A lovely wine for drinking now.",42.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24486,Cinnabar 2007 Amber Knolls Vineyard Malbec (Lake County),"A super-dark, well integrated, gamy, ripe and tannic Malbec that opens well and dives straight into savory and peppery characteristics. The wine is an interesting, fruit-forward version of California Malbec from a vineyard more known for Cabernet Sauvignon. Big (15% alcohol) but age-worthy.",50.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24499,Saint Laurent 2007 Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"A nicely structured Merlot from the Wahluke Slope, with aromas of sandalwood and blueberries. The mixed berry flavors run into tart pie cherries, sprinkled with a little pepper (from a small amount of Cabernet Franc in the blend). Well crafted and balanced.",27.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24735,Atwater 2007 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"There are a number of lovely Cab Francs coming from the Finger Lakes, but the smell of ripe red cherries accented with rich mocha, vanilla and smoke make Atwater's especially enticing. Lusciously fruity on the palate with intense blackberry and raspberry flavors, it's balanced with rustic notes of bramble, herbs, earth and violets. Soft tannins and smoke carry through to a long finish.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
24797,Napa Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A great buy in a smooth, dry Merlot that shows real Napa elegance and style. It's medium-bodied and lush, with appealing cherry, currant, licorice, tobacco, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now for the immediate appeal.",22.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
24897,Olabisi 2007 King Vineyard Petite Sirah (Suisun Valley),"Black and thick, this Petite Sirah delivers on all the variety's attributes in warm-climate California. It's blisteringly gregarious yet rounded, with smoky dark-fruit flavors that are initially hard to capture and tannins that verge on puckering. But time rewards—this wine hits its stride after being allowed to open and swirled around a few times. Enjoy it with a rich risotto or rack of ribs.",38.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
24914,Pomar Junction 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"This is a soft, hot Merlot. It has ripe flavors of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cocoa and pepper, and finishes dry.",28.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
24929,Fenestra 2007 Silvaspoons Vineyard Alvarelhão (Lodi),"A Livermore Valley sourcing a Portuguese red grape variety from a Lodi vineyard. Does it work? The wine's dark purple yet subdued at first in flavor, opening slightly into tones of blueberry, raspberry and sour cherry, a smidgen of spice on the finish. Worth trying.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
25055,Robert Hall 2007 Blanc de Robles White (Paso Robles),"Dry and balanced, this is a great food wine, with its crunchy acidity and minerality. A combination of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Piquepol, it shows nuanced flavors of the zests of Meyer lemons and limes, figs and green melons. Robert Hall is producing some of the most interesting white wines in Paso Robles.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25062,Clos du Bois 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"This wine has lots going for it. It's bone dry and clean, with bright, perky flavors of chamomile tea, sour lemon candy, vanilla, wildflowers, and something rich and exotic, like sweet dates. A great job at a versatile, complex young wine, and easy to find, with 130,000 cases produced.",14.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25083,Sineann 2007 Celilo Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"In 2007 the excellent Celilo vineyard serves up a stunning Gewürztraminer. The brilliantly displayed floral, citrus and mineral scents lead into a soft, rich and thoroughly delicious wine with layers of green berry, citrus, melon and mineral, along with refreshing acids and a streak of toasty hazelnut.",18.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
25086,Viento 2007 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors. Perhaps showing just a bit more intensity than the 2006, this is a terrific follow-up with the same mix of delicacy and power that suggests that the Columbia Gorge AVA may well be the best site in the Pacific Northwest to grow Riesling.",14.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
25091,Foursight 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc shows the crisp tartness that Anderson Valley brings to white wines. Fully dry, its flavors suggest lemongrass, grapefruit and pepper, with a racy tang of cold steel. The aftertaste is long and powerful.",20.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
25099,Navarro 2007 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"Perfectly fills the need in California for a bone-dry, racy white wine. Acidity is the star here, enriched with savory lemon and lime zest, grilled pineapple, pepper and mineral flavors. After all the oak and supersweetness of too many wines, it makes you want to sing and dance.",18.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
25114,Mauritson 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A lovely Zinfandel, classic and balanced, with an elegant tannin-acid structure. Shows typical Dry Creek Valley spices and briar, in addition to ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper cola and tobacco flavors.",27.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
25165,Matthews 2007 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vineyard-designated Sauv Blanc is half fermented in stainless steel, 40% in concrete eggs and the rest in French oak. It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya. There's plenty of stuffing and spice, and a perfect mix of the grape's innate herbaceous and grassy qualities, ramped up with riper, sweeter fruit.",30.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
25175,Jana 2007 Old Vine Riesling (Napa Valley),"You could classify this as an off-dry wine, but it's just sweet and honeyed enough to be a dessert wine. With pleasant acidity providing balance, it shows flavors of ripe peaches, diesel, nectarines, apples, vanilla and buttercup flowers.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
25181,Snoqualmie 2007 Naked Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Naked Riesling is organically farmed and produced. This new vintage already seems a bit tired and has an unusually deep (oxidized?) golden color. It's drinking well enough, like a somewhat aged apple cider, but does not have the sort of freshness that one would hope for in a just-released 2007 wine.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
25314,Daedalus Cellars 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Delicate and poised, this unusual Pinot Gris was fermented half in stainless and half in neutral oak, then kept on the lees for an extended period before bottling. The wine reveals itself gracefully with mixed green apple and white peach; hints of baking spice and a wash of vanilla wafer appear right at the finish line.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25315,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"This wine offers citrus—orange, grapefruit—and spice on the nose. On the palate, a sweeter array of apricot, tropical fruit and some lemon is buoyed by its minerality. A lusher style of Gewürtz that will pair well with spicy cuisine—think Indian curries.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25321,Sunstone 2007 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley),"Drier and more streamlined than many Viogniers out there, with a crisp spine of minerals that undergirds the variety's traditional exotic flavors. Beneath the chalk you'll find savory tastes of apricot jam, blood oranges, mint and vanilla.",29.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25325,RoxyAnn 2007 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"Like biting right into a crisp Asian pear, this clean and brightly fruity wine accents the fresh flavors with just a hint of nutmeg and sweet spice.",17.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
25495,Elizabeth Rose 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Too powerful in feline and gooseberry aromas and flavors, this dry, tart in-your-face Sauvignon Blanc just isn't ripe enough to recommend.",18.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
25496,Greenwood Ridge 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Greenwood Ridge often does a good job at Sauvignon Blanc, but not this year. The wine is irritating in unripe feline flavors and it's also off-dry, with 1.9% residual sugar.",18.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
25497,Ironstone 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc is really powerful in feline characteristics. Too powerful. Unless you like that peculiar smell and taste, it will turn you off.",10.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
25513,Smoking Loon 2007 Zinfandel (California),"Smells like tobacco and pepper, and then turns tannic and dry in the mouth, with blackberry flavors emerging after it warms up. A decent everyday Zin.",9.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
25518,Firestone 2007 Discoveries Merlot (California),"A bit heavy and soft, although it's nicely dry, with good tannins. The cherry flavors are mixed with herbs, with a touch of smoky oak.",10.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
25562,Castle Rock 2007 Merlot (Mendocino County),"A low-price, high-production Merlot from Mendocino County grapes that smells musky and tastes a bit bland.",10.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
25603,Navarro 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino),"ots of briary, brambly wild berry and cherry fruit in this robust Zin. Also lots of mouthwatering spices. It's basically dry, but jammy sweet also, suggesting pairing with barbecue sauces made with sugar.",19.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
25911,Sparkling Pointe 2007 Topaz Imperial Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties. While intensely aromatic of ripe red berries and plums, it maintains an elegant dryness throughout. Rich on the palate with a soft, delicate mousse, it lingers long on an earthy, mushroom-scented finish.",33.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
25919,Pellegrini Vineyards 2007 Petit Verdot (North Fork of Long Island),"Full bodied with a generously ripe black cherry and crème de cassis profile, this Petit Verdot (with just a hint of Merlot and Cab thrown in) is beautifully structured with a sturdy frame of tannins and minerality with shining tones of graphite and pencil lead.",22.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
25955,a-non-ah-mus 2007 Alisos Vineyard Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"This is a feminine wine, soft, generous and fruity. The raspberry and cherry flavors are jammy. There's some heat on the finish from high alcohol. Drink now.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
26795,Insatiable 2007 Merlot (California),"A sound, everyday Merlot. It has ripe blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, and feels smooth and rich in the mouth. Great job at this price.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
26796,Jacuzzi 2007 Barbera (Mendocino County),"Bring on the burgers and veal parmesan for this dry, exuberant table wine. It's tannic, with earthy flavors of cherries, currants, tobacco and oodles of peppery spice.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
26951,Sparkling Pointe 2007 Brut Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Scents of freshly cut herbs add a verdant quality to the yellow plum and white flower notes on this brisk, minerally blend comprised of the traditional Champagne grape varieties. Dry and tonic in style, it finishes clean and crisp, with just a hint of sugar-cookie-crumb sweetness.",29.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
27031,Prager 2007 Royal Escort Paladini Vineyard Port (Napa Valley),"This 100% Petite Sirah is very, very sweet. When the palate experiences this much concentrated brown sugar and caramel, it exults. The problem is that sweetness is pretty much all there is. You'll find blackberry jam and chocolate.",72.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
27050,Pomar Junction 2007 Syrah (Monterey County),"This wine comes from the San Lucas area of the southern Salinas Valley, on the way toward Paso Robles. It's a peppery wine, rustic, hot and dry, with strong jammy flavors of cherries and blackberries, and a long, spicy finish. Drink now.",42.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
27383,Hendry 2007 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A soft, hot, funky wine. Despite a wealth of berry, chocolate and spice flavors, high alcohol gives it a chile pepper burn.",35.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
27387,Franciscan 2007 Magnificat Meritage (Napa Valley),"Basically good, with jammy berry flavors, but ultimately clumsy, especially for the price. Shows overripe fruit and green tannins. Feels sharp toward the finish. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",50.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
27401,Kana 2007 Old Vines Red Red (Yakima Valley),"This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
27483,Sonoma Smith 2007 Goldensong White (Sonoma County),"A savory wine made in a slightly sweet style that has flavors of pineapples, peaches, and vanilla oak. Acidity is all-important for balance.The blend is 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% Sémillon.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
27879,Chateau St. Jean 2007 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Run, don't walk, to find this rich Merlot. It shows vast berry, currant, mocha, licorice and cola flavors, wrapped into superfine tannins and balanced with fine acidity. Easy to find, with 7,600 cases produced.",25.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
27967,Lost Canyon 2007 Stage Gulch Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"This is a dark, glyceriney, full-bodied Syrah that should have been held back a little longer before release, but you can make up for that with cellaring. It's tannic and raw now, but packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and pepper flavors that are totally dry, and firmed up with crisp acids. Best for a few years after 2009.",38.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
27974,Beresan 2007 Sémillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Always estate grown and 100% varietal, Beresan makes one of the best Sémillons in the state. Exceptionally dry and crisp, this again suggests sweet grain, citrus and light tropical fruits. Notes of lemon oil and even a hint of diesel come in as subtleties. Though not as full-bodied and rich as the 2006, it's an excellent, well-made bottle, more in the style of a Bordeaux blanc.",18.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
27981,Rendition 2007 Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley),"Great price for a big, powerful red like this. Tough in tannins now, it shows classic flavors of currants, mocha, anise and pepper, and will develop over time. Classy and impressive.",9.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
28018,Tulpen 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Rhône blend that will, in future vintages, not be varietally named, this is far from a standard Washington Syrah. It's threaded beautifully with nuances of fruit and spice from the Viognier coferment, Grenache and Mourvèdre that are included. Aromatic, spicy and weaving together chocolate, licorice, granite, roasted meat and berry flavors, it is both substantial and forward.",20.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
28168,Guenoc 2007 Victorian Claret Red (Lake County),"Distinctly sugary, which gives the blackberries and cherries a jammy sweetness. But it's clean and crisp. For those who like this style, it's pretty good.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
28332,Cosentino 2007 The Zin Zinfandel (Lodi),"Lusty and strong, this is Lodi Zinfandel at its most classic. It's a big, thick, softly ripe wine that floods the mouth with exuberant flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants and peppery spices. Easy to like. Drink now.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
28348,HammerSky 2007 Party of Four Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles),"This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012.",59.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
28349,Murphy-Goode 2007 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Here's a good, robust red wine. It's not particularly Merlot-like, with its pepper, herb, cherry, red currant and cola flavors, wrapped into sticky tannins. But it's very dry and elegantly structured, and the alcohol is moderate. Fine with a nice steak or chop.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
28501,Concannon 2007 Heritage Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"Age has been kind to this Petite, one of Concannon's smalller bottlings. The wine is noticeably easygoing with mellowed plum and blackberry fruit and tamed tannins.",60.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
28509,Due Vigne 2007 Musso Family Vineyard Nebbiolo (El Dorado County),"Due Vigne's mountain-grown Sierra Nebbiolo is savory, embellished with olive tapenade, sour cherry, cranberry and caramel, its tannins sufficiently managed to make this wine a rich, robust red with finesse. Small percentages of Barbera and Dolcetto are blended in.",26.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
28568,Den Hoed 2007 Marie's View Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"It's a difficult challenge to blend six different grapes into a wine without sacrificing focus, but winemaker Rob Newsom has done a splendid job with this new vintage of Marie's View. Roughly a third Cabernet and a third Syrah, which provide a potent core of deep red and black fruits, the wine is nuanced with layers of spice, leaf, toasted grain, loam and coffee grounds. Fine acids promise a long life.",80.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
28608,Blackbird Vineyards 2007 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least.",90.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
28904,Guardian 2007 Conner Lee Vineyard Gun Metal Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit is ripe and the tannins firm; winemaker Jerry Reiner is able to craft very ripe fruit while keeping the varietal character of the Cabs—earth and herb, with a touch of stem. Deep and substantial, this should age well for a decade or more.",37.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
28905,JM Cellars 2007 Merlot (Red Mountain),"This is pure Washington Merlot, sourced from Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval and the original 1976 planting at Kiona. Initially stiff and herbal, it opens grudgingly, streaked with black olive, black cherry, earth and dark chocolate. The muscularity is a fine demonstration of why and how Washington Merlot is ageworthy; a showcase of tight black raspberry and cassis, with a core of iron.",38.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
29087,Matchbook 2007 Tempranillo (Dunnigan Hills),"Shows the many difficulties of getting this finicky variety right. The wine is tough and gritty in tannins and scoury acids, with some unripe cherry, mint and sage flavors. But it's very dry and the alcohol is moderate.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
29167,Sunstone 2007 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"This is a fine, dry, crisp sipper with rewarding flavors of citrus fruits, figs, wildflowers, honey, thyme and pepper. With its crisp acidity and oak-tinged creamy texture, its spectrum falls between Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29193,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Coure di Vigne Red (Paso Robles),"Here's a soft, lushly delicious wine to drink now with steak, veal, pork, chicken or just about anything that wants a dry, medium-bodied red wine. It's rich in berry, currant, tobacco, spice and cedar flavors, and possesses that hard to define quality of finesse.",35.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29195,Mosby 2007 Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"This Sangiovese wants decanting for a few hours to let it breathe and open up. Right out of the bottle, it's acidic and tannic, with lots of astringency covering the cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors. Drink now, with rich, oily fare.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29197,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Ame de la Vigne Red (Paso Robles),"This is a very good blend from Paso Robles, showing the region's ability to ripen red grapes. It's a little on the soft side, but robust tannins provide good structure to the cherry, berry, beef jerky and pepper flavors. Drink now for freshness.",35.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29200,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 156 Syrah (Mendocino County),"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29203,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins. It seems more honest and direct, without the wash of vanilla and jam, and more food-friendly as well, with the stuffing to take on a flank or hanger steak.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29210,Spring Valley Vineyard 2007 Frederick Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Spring Valley wines have never been shy and retiring, but here the alcohol – 15.2% – seems to quickly mute the textural subtleties. Though it suggests a panoply of red and black fruits in the nose, the palate is a wash of coffee, toast, tannin and alcohol. The flavors get muddy and the alcohol strips the wine of its terroir.",50.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29226,OnThEdge 2007 Frediani Vineyard Charbono (Napa Valley),"An engaging wine from an old variety, hardly grown anymore in California. It's soft and dense in tannins, with spicy flavors of cherries and a bitter, earthy taste that brings to mind carob. Try as an interesting alternative to Zinfandel.",40.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29427,Abacela 2007 Albariño (Southern Oregon),"Abacela's dedication to Iberian varieties extends to this bright and peppery take on Albariño. Fresh, bracing and bone dry, it evokes the wines of Rías Baixas without losing its New World flesh and ripeness. Delicious already, it seems likely to improve for at least another two or three years.",23.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
29434,Shannon Ridge 2007 Roussanne (Lake County),"Tastes like a cross between a flowery, fruity Pinot Gris and a ripe, oaky Sauvignon Blanc. The flavors are enormously rich, spanning the gamut from pears and tangerines to green melons, white peaches, pineapples and honeysuckles. Best in its youthful exuberance.",30.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
29455,Hahn 2007 Syrah (Central Coast),"Peppery! Mounds of freshly crushed black peppercorns erupt from the glass, giving the blackberries and currants a spicy finish. Shows real class and elegance for the price.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29531,Tarara 2007 Meritage Red (Virginia),"This earthy Meritage is a standout of the Virginia wine scene. The nose is suave and subtle, dominated by notes of forest floor, strawberry and espresso. Gripping tannins frame the palate which is packed with fresh black cherry fruit. Finishes dense and black. Give it a few years in the cellar.",40.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29533,J. Lohr 2007 Tower Road Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Shows a huge, welcome improvement over the '06. It's soft and melted, in the way of Paso reds, but very rich and tasty, with black cherry, chocolate, red currant and pepper flavors that finish fruity-sweet, although the wine itself is dry.",35.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
29791,Hauck 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A bit on the sugary side, making it not truly dry, but adequate acidity provides balance to the very rich pineapple, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. Great with Vietnamese or Chinese fare.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
29806,Bink 2007 Melange Red (Yorkville Highlands),"It's a Cabernet-Merlot blend from this highland appellation, inland from Anderson Valley in Mendocino County. The big drawback is excessive acidity. It's harsh and cutting, and interferes with what seem like pleasant blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
30000,Tamarack Cellars 2007 Sagemoor Vineyards Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This very limited reserve mixes old-vine fruit from the Bacchus and Weinbau vineyards (all under the Sagemoor umbrella). Berries, cherries and cassis draw you into a dusty, detailed wine with nuances of herb and earth. A lick of rich dark chocolate ends it with a flourish.",50.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
30039,Heron Hill 2007 Ingle Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Ripe, juicy blackberries burst from the nose and palate of this deliciously fruit-forward Cab Franc. Sweet, exotic violets, herbs and earthy bramble notes add complexity to the fruit, along with balanced oak and a cheery, sour cherry acidity.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
30040,Fleming Jenkins 2007 Choreography Red (Napa Valley),"Front-loaded with ripe, juicy blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a nice wine to drink now. It's flashy and flamboyant, if a bit direct.",50.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
30127,Chiarito 2007 Estate Bottled Nero d'Avola (Mendocino),"John Chiarito is the first American to petition for the right to label his wine Nero d'Avola, a variety he grows just outside of the town of Ukiah in eastern Mendocino and a nod to his family's Southern Italian heritage (the grape is native to Sicily). Here he's made an outstandingly intriguing, rustic, big fruit, high-acid red that'll surprise you as it opens, very Old World and definitely worth a try if you can find it. Only 60 cases produced.",36.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30130,Tranche 2007 Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Emblematic of the new direction for Tranche, this pure varietal has power and presence. It gracefully captures the herbaceous aspect of the grape, without sacrificing the deep purple fruit. Fragrant on entry, though the tannins are still a little hard and chewy. Balanced and complex.",25.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30133,Brian Carter Cellars 2007 Le Coursier Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential. The acids and tannins are in good proportion, and the fruit is not overtaken with new oak, but there is enough (40%) to frame it with some sweet spices.",30.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30249,Ventosa 2007 Sangiovese (Finger Lakes),"Tar, tobacco and smoke can't mask the green tomato leaf characteristics on this ruby red Sangiovese. There are some interesting spice notes, but not a lot of ripeness or concentration in the fruit.",29.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
30473,Merriam 2007 Windacre Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),"Tough, dry and gritty, with astringent tannins framing black cherry and oak flavors. Finishes hot, with a scour of alcohol. Lacks elegance and breed. Drink up.",40.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
30538,Meadowcroft 2007 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A soft, rather sweet Zinfandel, with granola health bar flavors of raspberries, cocoa, crunchy toasted almonds and cinnamon spice.",21.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
30554,Wilson 2007 Sawyer Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Heavy and dense, with a soft texture and melted, thick tannins. Lacks structure and vitality, although the blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors are very good.",32.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
30742,Krupp Brothers 2007 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky.",60.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
30746,Lachini 2007 La Contrada Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A classic from the first sniff to the last swallow, this Bordeaux blend, made for Lachini by winemaker Jamie Brown, offers tangy red fruits, pepper, toast and earth highlights, with a base of green olive and brown spices. All in all, a fascinating wine with subtle variations on the Bordeaux theme.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30752,Exuberance 2007 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Berries are the name of the game in this rich, forward Syrah. Cherries, raspberries, mulberries and spicier, gamier kinds of wild berries mark the flavors, which are lifted by sweet, smoky oak. The mouthfeel is pure and velvety, courtesy of ripely soft tannins. A fashionable wine to drink now, especially with lamb.",49.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30756,Tulpen 2007 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A juicy, delicious Sangio, whose bright acidity underscores a lush mix of raspberries, blackberries, boysenberries and plum. The alcohol is a substantial 14.8%. The wine benefits from an extra year of bottle age, and is now beginning to hint at grace notes of leaf and tobacco.",20.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30761,Stonestreet 2007 Legacy Red (Alexander Valley),"Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.",85.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
30800,Maison Bleue 2007 Notre Vie Viognier (Yakima Valley),"The blend is 85% Viognier and 15% Roussanne, and finishes off-dry with 1.5% residual sugar. A slight blush color and mixed fruit flavors of melon and pear carry the wine, which has a definite sugary sweetness in the mouth. There is also an impression of celery, believe it or not, making for an unusual mix that will intrigue some tasters, and confuse others.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
30801,Maryhill 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"After its rather sugary 2006 version of this wine, Maryhill has returned to a more authentic, grassy style in 2007, with the alcohol back up over 14%. It's a big improvement, showing varietal character and ripe flavors of melon and grapefruit.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
30805,Vin du Lac 2007 LEHM Michaela's Vineyard Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Juicy and tart, this estate-grown Sauvignon Blanc has a pleasing mix of light melon, lime, white peach and grapefruit flavors. Hints of sweet grass and a suggestion of sweetness, like lemonade, fill out the finish.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
30818,Vin du Lac 2007 LEHM Dry Riesling (Chelan County),"Fresh, lightly pétillant, and scented with hints of clover and spice, this elegant dry Riesling offers light fruit flavors of pear, citrus, stone and herb. It loses momentum and fades rather quickly in the mouth.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
30850,Fenestra 2007 Silvaspoons Vineyards Touriga Nacional (Lodi),"A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.",23.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
30894,Keenan 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms.",36.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
30901,Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2007 Sparkling (Sonoma Coast),"Excellent price for a coastal sparkling wine made from the superior grape varieties of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Rich and ripe in strawberries, limes and vanilla, it has a doughy yeastiness, with crisp acidity and a dry finish.",25.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
31171,RoxyAnn 2007 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"Like biting right into a crisp Asian pear, this clean and brightly fruity wine accents the fresh flavors with just a hint of nutmeg and sweet spice.",17.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
31181,Mahoney 2007 Las Brisas Vineyard Riesling (Carneros),"Here's a pretty Riesling. It shows the high acidity you want in the variety, and is dry, with savory flavors of citrus, flowers, minerals, spices and petrol. Should hold for a number of years.",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
31301,Krupp Brothers 2007 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak.

31315,Guenoc 2007 Meritage (Lake County),"From Guenoc a blend of Bordeaux varieties (43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Petite Verdot, 20% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc) that veers into the overly tannic side of Cab without quite the right balance of fruit. Not much on the nose or finish.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
31397,Duarte Georgetown 2007 Georgetown Divide Petit Verdot (El Dorado),"This Petit Verdot grown on the hillsides of El Dorado County in California Gold Country is all dark berry and strawberry jam, still tight and grippy with room to develop added complexity over time.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
31481,Château Potelle 2007 Explorer The Illegitimate VGS Red (Napa Valley),"A tough, gritty wine, with overripe, pruny flavors. It's quite dry and tannic, and will not age. Basically a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Syrah.",29.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
32110,Rocky Hill 2007 Richard Dinner Vineyards Red (Sonoma Mountain),"An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy.",36.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
32219,Cor Cellars 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This off-dry (11.5% alcohol) Riesling is a fruit-driven wine, with a tangy sweet/tart mouthfeel reminiscent of Vouvray. Meyer lemon, apricot, lime and candied pineapple flavors pile on. There's plenty of natural acid to cut through the sweetness.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
32371,Wine Guerrilla 2007 Goat Trek Vineyard Block 6 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows lots of flashy, ripe Zin character, with a blast of wild berry, tobacco, currant, nettle and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rough-edged, calling for big, rich fare, like barbecue.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
32451,Gianelli 2007 Vermentino (Tuolumne County),"Vermentino is a Mediterranean variety rarely found in California. Gianelli has done a good job. The wine is crisp, with zesty flavors of limes, oranges, vanilla and honeysuckle flowers.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
32506,Carr 2007 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way.",50.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
32598,Illumination 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a new wine from Agustin Huneeus, of Quintessa. It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter Sémillon. Oak does not play a significant role, although the lees do. The wine itself is absolutely dry, crisp and minerally. It has palate-stimulating citrus flavors and is extraordinarily refined. Its only peer in Napa Valley is Mondavi's Tokalon Fumé Blanc.",40.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
32908,Lamoreaux Landing 2007 76 West Red (Finger Lakes),"Sweet with the aroma of ripe, red plum preserves and a touch of green herbs, this is a lovely blend of Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with hints of toasted oak. Soft and lush with a cherry pie filling palate, it's an easygoing, medium-bodied wine with a pleasant, fruit-forward profile.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
32911,Pomum 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A serviceable Syrah, with somewhat muted blueberry and huckleberry fruit, pepper and herb. Medium concentration, with more of the herbal and stem flavors coming through in the tannins.",32.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
32917,Clautiere 2007 BDX Red (Paso Robles),"Lots of ripe, sweet blackberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors in this soft, tannic Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dry, but high alcohol glycerine, combined with the fruity extract, make it taste almost like Port. Drink now.",36.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
33260,Kuyam 2007 Cuvée Nolan Santa Barbara Highlands Red (Santa Barbara County),"Named after winemaker David Corey's son, this 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot begins with nose-tickling scents of berry syrup and smoked cigars. The maduro cigar flavor consumes the palate, with black cherry fruit and smooth tannins. It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb.",42.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
33333,Bonterra 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County-Mendocino County),"Good price for a dry, crisp wine of this quality. Shows zesty gooseberry, citrus, green apple and honeysuckle flavors and a brisk, clean mouthfeel.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
33379,Prospect 772 2007 The Brat Red (Sierra Foothills),"Softly tannic, sexy and delicious, with waves of berry-cherry pie filling and mocha for richness, and drier, tarter notes of currants, leather, rhubarb and pomegranates, accentuated with smoky wood. A blend of Grenache and Syrah, it's sophisticated and nuanced. Try as an interesting, more food-friendly alternative to Cabernet Sauvignon.",36.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
33388,Betz Family 2007 La Serenne Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.",55.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
33750,Robert Mondavi 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
33754,Jorian Hill 2007 Beespoke Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes. Yet it lacks the vital structure a good Rhône blend wants in order to house all this richness. Drink now. Grenache-Syrah.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
33755,Jorian Hill 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34097,Breaux 2007 Meritage Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Malbec-Petit Verdot-Cabernet Franc Red (Virginia),"This smells dark and bold, offering Port-like aromas of chocolate ganache, buttercream frosting, brown spice and sun-baked fruit. Hearty and toasty, the palate packs plenty of muscle in the form of strapping tannins and supporting acids. Pair this with seared flank steak with a coffee-soy rub to accent the wine's decadence.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34463,Hosmer 2007 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"The complex, seductive nose promises a bit more than the palate delivers. Nonetheless, there is good complexity and a moderately long, if somewhat watery, finish. The slight residual sugar will make this a good choice with drier Asian dishes. Drink now.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34480,Tempus Cellars 2007 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"A chewy, high-acid take on Merlot, with a strong herbal note to the tannins. It might almost pass for Carmenère. The fruit flavors are subdued but ripe enough, and the alcohol touches 14.7%. This is the sort of muscular Merlot that can take the place of Cabernet alongside a grilled steak.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
34493,Paoletti 2007 Non Plus Ultra Red (Napa Valley),"This is a very big, extractedly fruity Bordeaux blend. Right now, it's tannic and sharp and dry, but it has explosive blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Rather too angular and awkward for complete enjoyment, but cellar for 4–6 years and try again.",65.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
34497,St. Francis 2007 Anthem Meritage (Sonoma Valley),"Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.",60.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
34498,Velocity 2007 Velo Red Red (Rogue Valley),"An affordable blend that is almost 60% Malbec, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc and Syrah. It drinks well, smooth and polished, and the rough tannins that can often overtake the fruit in this region have been nicely managed here, pulling the wine into balance. Strawberry and light black cherry, some herb and tar, and good grip for an everyday red.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
34583,Midnight 2007 Zenith Red (Paso Robles),"Overripe and raisiny, with sweet, shriveled blackberry and oak flavors, leading to a hot finish. Drink now.",65.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
34591,Eagle Castle 2007 Trinity Red (Paso Robles),"Harsh and rustic, with jellied berry and red pepper flavors. Feels soft, simple and sweet. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.",25.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
34730,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate. Pretty, balanced and lingering in the finish. A great food wine.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34735,Terry Hoage 2007 5 Blocks Red (Paso Robles),"Extremely high alcohol shows up as heat throughout, especially in the finish. That aside, this Rhône red blend has lots to like. It's dry and full-bodied and soft, with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate, leather, anise, black pepper and sandalwood. Drink now with rich meats and cheeses.",48.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34736,Veramar 2007 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"This seductive Cabernet Franc opens up with aromas of cherry, vanilla and spice leading into layers of blackberry, plum, cinnamon and cedar on the palate. Fruit and spice are balanced here, and medium tannins means the wine can age. Paired with roasted duck or beef, the wine is a sure hit.",21.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
34742,Scheid Vineyards 2007 Grenache (Monterey),"Here's a dry, elegant Grenache for drinking now. It has a silky texture, with slightly rough tannins and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mocha, pepper and herbs.",21.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
35250,Hall 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A rich, dense, vital Merlot, one of the best of the vintage. Offers loads of cherry, green olive, roasted meat and pepper flavors, wrapped into firm tannins leading to a distinguished finish. Dry and elegant, it's a beautiful wine to decant and drink soon with steak, chops, lamb.",30.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
35304,Mount Baker 2007 Proprietor's Limited Release Petit Verdot (Yakima Valley),"Petit Verdot is not an easy grape; here it turns volatile, the grapes pruney, and the finish tannic and short.",20.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
35546,Elsom Cellars 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Peppery and bright, this carries tart flavors of wild berries and mountain herbs. The penetrating peppery character is its most defining attribute.",36.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
35645,Ash Hollow 2007 Nine Mile Red Table Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A Bordeaux-style blend that spent three years in barrel, this is showing a dried blood/brick edge and has lost its primary fruit flavors. Plum and prune fruit, somewhat dried out, finishes with stiff tannins.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
35664,Gianelli 2007 Nino Red (Tuolumne County),"Young, fresh and jammy, this blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah, Dolcetto and Sangiovese has flavors of cherries, leather, anise and cedar. It's an easy, rustic wine to drink with BBQ.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35665,Vino Valpredo 2007 Squeezebox Red Red (Sonoma County),"Soft and easy in texture, with a silky mouthfeel framing flavors of cherries, herbs and herbs. There's some bitterness throughout. Try with rich meats or hard cheeses.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35674,Rivka Simone 2007 Viognier (Russian River Valley),"There's good, mouthwatering acidity in this Viognier, but it's not enough to balance out the sweet directness of the fruit. Tastes like apricot, peach and pineapple jam, almost a dessert wine.",28.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35714,Jana 2007 Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),"Floral, spicy and sweet on the nose, and with a straightforward, refreshing blend of typical Riesling flavors, this wine is dependable and pretty, and will pair well with spicy Asian and Indian cuisine. A touch sweet but clean.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35718,Morgan 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"With just a touch of oak, this is a pretty good Sauvignon Blanc. It's a little sweet in fig, citrus, passionfruit and melon flavors, but those Monterey acids are brisk and provide a clean balance.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35728,Chaddsford 2007 Spring Wine White (Pennsylvania),"Lemon citrus, toast, white flowers—the lead on this wine is feminine and light and, as the name suggests, feels like a warm weather match. Flavors of like style are sweet and simple but balanced by some crispness and finesse. It's a pretty wine that offers simple, easy drinking enjoyment.",13.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35735,Frog's Leap 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"This unoaked Sauvignon Blanc is crisply acidic, with honey-infused lemon, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. It has an edge of acrid gooseberries that some people will find troublesome, while others will compare it favorably to New Zealand wines.",18.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35799,Robert Mondavi 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
35891,Beresan 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tight, sharp, and toasty, this thick and compact wine shows plenty of cherry fruit wrapped in chocolaty oak. It hints at toast and cracker, but never quite breaks through into the complexity that is promised by the first whiff or two.",25.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
35922,Locati Cellars 2007 Innovation Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Roughly half of this is Barbera, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The Cab firms up the tannins, but the fruit lacks substance and depth, and the chocolaty oak does not add much interest.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35927,Calcareous 2007 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Tastes like it has residual sugar. Either that, or the enormously high alcohol is giving it a glyceriney taste. Maybe both. Whatever the cause, this Syrah is uncomfortably sweet through the finish, giving the blackberry and cherry flavors a candied quality. Ready now.",34.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
35931,Maryhill 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pinot Gris can often show a little bit of a tawny blush, as it's a fairly dark-skinned white grape, but this is downright coppery, like a French Rosé. It's closer to an Oregon style than to other Washington Pinot Gris, with fleshy pear-flavored fruit and light hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Gets off to a good start, then falls away quite rapidly into a quick, generic finish.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
35934,Nola 2007 Galleron Road Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Aggressive in grass, hay, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, this wine's dry, slightly vegetal quality is enriched with sweeter notes of lemon sorbet and vanilla. Notable for the acidity, which makes it exceptionally crisp and clean.",20.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
36123,Jonata 2007 Todos Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from mostly Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a compelling wine to drink now. It exudes concentrated flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste like they have been baked in pie crust and sprinkled with baking spice. Notes of bacon, licorice and sandalwood add further complexity. The structure is superb, with citrusy acids and supple tannins. All profits from the sale of this wine go to Jonata's vineyard crew.",50.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
36139,Fiesta del Pomar Junction 2007 Red (Central Coast),"This blend of Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is soft and slightly sweet, like a dessert. Tastes like a melted mélange of blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate granola and dusty spices. Drink now.",34.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
36324,Basel Cellars 2007 Pheasant Run Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake.

36333,Montemaggiore 2007 Nobile Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"There aren't many California Cab-Syrah blends this satisfying. Perhaps the main reason, aside from good viticulture and winemaking, is the source, Dry Creek Valley, where the grapes got sweet and ripe in blackberry, currant, bacon and spice flavors, yet maintained enough acidity for balance. The tannins are a bit tough and brambly, but this is a delicious wine to drink now with richly sauced beef dishes.",45.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
36366,El Roy 2007 Malbec (Alexander Valley),"A good everyday red wine, rich and sweet in dark berrry, chocolate and smoked meat flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. It's soft and ready for drinking now.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
36372,Bella Luna 2007 Estate Riserva Bellicaia Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Very ripe and fruity, in the Paso style, with tiers of sweet red and black cherry pie filling and spice flavors. The acidity, which must come from the Sangiovese, is quite high and a little invasive, but it's a charming wine.",45.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
36406,Ca' Momi 2007 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Simple and jammy, with sweet flavors of cherries, currants, licorice and spices.",15.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36407,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Sweaty and pruney in the nose, this hot and disjointed wine could be almost any red grape; there's no varietal character. It's volatile and thins out quickly, leaving green tannins in the back of the mouth.",32.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36411,Praxis 2007 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A tough, green wine, with minty sharp acidity and not much fruit, although you'll find some modest cherry flavor.",19.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36412,Gia Domella 2007 E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Burning hot in alcohol, this Zin is totally dry. It has peppery flavors of shriveled grapes and currants, with a bitter mouthfeel.",26.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36416,Venteux 2007 Grenache (Paso Robles),"Soft, sweet and Porty, with sugared flavors of red cherry jam and red currants. Feels hot and prickly in the mouth.",28.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36419,Carmel 2007 S&S; Syrah (Monterey County),"Vegetal, with a green bell pepper aroma and taste. What fruit there is veers toward currants, and the mouthfeel is soft.",35.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
36551,Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Strikes a nice balance of ripe berry and chocolate flavors, firmed with softly smooth tannins, and a deep earthy-spiciness suggesting sweet tobacco, anise and sage. Turns lush and intricate toward the finish. This is a really nice Zinfandel.",22.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
36808,D.H. Lescombes 2007 Limited Release Mourvèdre (New Mexico),"This New Mexico Mourvèdre has a deep, soulful profile with aromas of blackberry and spice and mouthfilling flavors of blackberry and vanilla toast. Soft but lingering, the wine is an elegant, food-friendly choice.",24.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
36809,Dancing Coyote 2007 Rhumba White (Clarksburg),"Sweet and fantastically fruity, this blend of Gewürz, Riesling, Orange Muscat and Chenin Blanc erupts in jammy orange, pineapple, green apple, peach, pear, honeysuckle and spice flavors.",11.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
36813,Penguin Bay 2007 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Crisp and fresh aromas of pineapple and melon lead on this pretty semi-sweet Riesling, and are followed by slightly sweet, floral flavors that are kept light with a citric, minerally backbone. Pair with chicken salad, Thai cuisine, even curry.",14.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
36821,D.H. Lescombes 2007 Limited Release Cabernet Franc (New Mexico),Sweet red wines are hard to come by but Lescombes in New Mexico offers up this passable Beaujolais-like example. Scents of cinnamon spice and blueberry flavors in the mouth complete the unique profile.,36.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
36877,San Antonio 2007 Cask 520 Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and creamy, like a chocolate and black raspberry drink, sprinkled with pepper and cinnamon. Almost like a Port in its sweetness.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
37181,Alexandria Nicole 2007 Tempranillo (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is the third vintage for this rare Washington Tempranillo from Alexandria Nicole. It's a crowd-pleaser, with deep fruit flavors of black cherry candy, wrapped in earthy, dusty tannins. As it breathes the aromas show vanilla, lanolin and spice, and the wine has excellent weight and concentration for such young vines.",55.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
37389,Macauley 2007 Special Selected Late Harvest Botrytis Sémillon (Alexander Valley),"This is one of the best dessert wines available from California. It's dazzlingly rich and sweet in orange jam, apricot, honey, buttered cinnamon toast and créme brûlée flavors. The intense sweetness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, and the wine despite its sweetness accomplishes the miracle of finishing dry and clean. The grapes are 100% Sémillon.",45.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
37392,Staglin 2007 INEO Red (Napa Valley),"Here's a young, strong, vigorous wine that needs cellar time. It's absolutely dry, and hits the palate with numbing tannins. But the blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are intense and concentrated. Earns its high score by the wonderful combination of elegance and potency. Hold until after 2015.",250.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
37494,Flora Springs 2007 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.",65.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
37628,Cupcake 2007 Petite Sirah (Central Coast),"Soft and sweetly jammy, with a thick mouthfeel and lush flavors of blackberry jam, melted chocolate and anise liqueur. Okay for BBQ.",14.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

37632,Malibu 2007 Meritage (California),"Good blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and properly dry, with a good background of smoky oak. But it's way too soft, causing structural collapse.",40.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
37640,Korbin Kameron 2007 Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend Red (Sonoma Valley),"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",55.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
37656,Cambiata 2007 Tannat (Monterey),"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time. Interesting as an alternative to a big Zinfandel or Petite Sirah.",28.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
37958,Osprey's Dominion 2007 Flight Meritage (North Fork of Long Island),"There's a musky leather note that adds intrigue to crisp black-plum notes in this mineral-intense Meritage. Moderately full in body, the palate is concentrated, with pristine fruit balanced by a kick of acidity and ripe tannins.",24.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131

38302,Napa Smith 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Marked by beautifully smooth, rounded tannins, this supple, polished Merlot offers very ripe flavors of cherries, red currants, violets, anise and sandalwood. If you like your wines when they're all primary fruit, drink it now. Otherwise, stash it away for three or four years.",39.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
38368,Greenwood Ridge 2007 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"A lovely wine whose most memorable and distinctive attributes are its dryness and high acidity, not to mention relatively low alcohol. These make it extremely food-friendly, and the citrus, wildflower and vanilla flavors will pair nicely with everything from pâté to a pear, and bitter green salad to pizza.",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
38499,Lapis Luna 2007 Zinfandel (Lodi),"As sweet as raspberry tea sweetened with a couple spoons of white sugar. Alcohol provides a pleasant burn. If this sweeter style of Zin is your thing, it's quite a nice wine.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
39266,Coeur d'Alene 2007 BDX Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"McKinley Springs vineyard sourced this outstanding blend of Cabernet Franc (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%) and Merlot (19%).

39267,Gloria Ferrer 2007 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Carneros),"A really nice sparkling wine from Gloria Ferrer.

Best over the next few years.",42.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
39346,Gundlach Bundschu 2007 Estate Vineyard Tempranillo (Sonoma Valley),"This is a soft, semi-sweet wine with rich flavors of cherry and raspberry jam, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's a little syrupy. Give it a chill in the fridge before drinking.",36.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
39355,Vivác Winery 2007 Merlot (New Mexico),"The nose is a pleasant harmony of dark, ripe fruit, espresso grinds and carefully charred French oak. Coffee and cigar box notes carry through the palate as well, marrying with fresher red-fruit flavors. There's quite a bit of tannin to grapple with still, but overall, it's a pleasant medium-bodied red.",17.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
39356,Watkins Family 2007 Zinfandel- Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"A robust blend of two popular varieties, this full-bodied red is basically dry and fairly tannic. It's enormously rich and extracted in blackberries and cherries, with notes of bacon, beef jerky, tobacco and scads of peppery spices. Drink now.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
39361,Long Island Merlot Alliance 2007 Merliance Merlot (Long Island),"Well integrated charred oak melds well with ripe blackberry and black plum aromas in this blend of Merlot from a cooperative of Long Island winemakers.

39421,Wine Guerrilla 2007 Coffaro Vineyards Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is Wine Guerilla's most costly Zin and also their best, most Zinny one. It's textbook Dry Creek Valley.

39430,Honker Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is one of the best values in Sauvignon Blanc, or any white wine, of this year. It's completely satisfying, giving Loire-like minerality and acidity with ripe Napa flavors of spearmint, lemons and limes, figs and spices that finish thoroughly dry. Restaurateurs, buy this by the case and serve it by the glass.",12.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
39437,Chaleur Estate 2007 Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux. The barrel influences are many and varied, layering in a mix of smoke, caramel and cracker; and the fruit is supple and beautifully blended. White raisins, Asian pears, pineapple and peaches blend together gracefully, and the alcohol remains at a moderate 13.8%.",35.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
39505,Super Sonoman 2007 Meritage (Sonoma County),"Dry, rich and intricate, this is clearly capable of aging. The tannins are still pretty fierce, and buried under them is a dense core of blackberry and currant fruit—a testament to the near-perfect vintage conditions. The Bordeaux-style blend is mainly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Give it until 2016.",75.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
39596,Dutton-Goldfield 2007 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Dramatic in depth and structure, a cool-climate Syrah that will benefit from some time in the cellar. Deeply saturated in color, bone dry and full bodied, it offers ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with plenty of black pepper and sweet, chewy leather. Now, with decanting, and through 2013.",35.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
39599,Demetria 2007 Cuvée Constantine Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Interesting flavors in this dry Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. They range from cherries, red currants and raspberries to teriaki beef, bacon, cola and buttered cinnamon toast, with all sorts of exotic Asian spices. It's quite a tannic wine, and very dry. Shows a certain nobility, but you'll want to decant it, even overnight, to let it breathe.",40.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
39899,Bolen 2007 Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"Delicious in flavor, with fresh, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak overlay adds richer layers of sweet caramel and buttered cinnamon toast.

40106,Whitman Cellars 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has been 10% barrel fermented and aged for about two months. There's a hint of barrel toast but it's very light; the varietal character is nicely displayed. Crisp acidity and a strong citrus mix of orange blossom and lemon rind flavors define the midpalate, leading into pineapple and grapefruit as it winds through the finish. Nice bottle!",19.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
40242,Ferrari-Carano 2007 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"By calling it Fumé, instead of Sauvignon, Blanc, the winery telegraphs that the wine was aged in barrels. The wood has given a subtle, rich texture of smoky cream, while the yeast adds doughy notes to the citrus, fig and spice flavors.",17.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
40243,Francis Coppola 2007 Sofia Pinot Noir Rosé (Sonoma Coast),"What's so refreshing about this blush wine is its crisp acidity and the slight bitterness that makes it almost like a digestif. It has a wealth of fresh, green herb flavors, like sage and thyme, along with red cherryskin and white pepper. Complex and full-bodied, it can replace a red Pinot on hot summer nights.",17.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
40251,Palaia Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Franc (New York),"Dark toast and char lend a spicy woodsiness to this bold, beefy Cabernet Franc. It's concentrated on the palate, with plush plum and blackberry flavors accented by savory tones of earth and animal. Finishes with a thick blanket of velvety tannins.",15.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
40276,Kontos 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A strong, spicy, sharp-edged take on Washington Merlot, sourced from a trio of excellent vineyards – StoneTree, Klipsun and Boushey. Dark and meaty, this brings bacon fat and black cherry, cassis and chocolate, in a full-bodied, forward style. Bring on the steak.",30.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
40279,Otis Kenyon 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Rapidly maturing, with some brick coloring and secondary fruit flavors of prune and raisin. Drinking nicely, and quite delicious. Along with the smooth fruit you get smoke, dust, cocoa and a hint of caramelized sugar.",30.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
40283,Dunham 2007 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the artist label Merlot; a firm, spicy expression of fruit from the Lewis vineyard. Threads of liquid smoke, spice and coffee are woven into the red fruits—a mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors. Still young and sharp, it has some heat in the finish. Additional bottle age recommended.",75.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
40297,Wilson 2007 Ellie's Old Vine Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Soft and fruity, a gently tannic, easy and slightly sweet Zinfandel to drink now with barbecue and beef tacos. It's filled with jammy blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and spices.",32.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
40299,Muirwood 2007 Merlot (Arroyo Seco),"Here's a good, dry, affordable Merlot that offers plenty of everyday pleasure. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with flavors of cherries and mocha that finish in a scour of tannins and spice.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
40331,Northwest Totem Cellars 2007 Low Man Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aggressively tannic, this is an earthy red wine with a lot of barrel influence. The fruit vanishes into a mélange of pepper, clove, coffee and tannin.",33.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
40348,Guenoc 2007 Meritage (Lake County),"From Guenoc a blend of Bordeaux varieties (43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Petite Verdot, 20% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc) that veers into the overly tannic side of Cab without quite the right balance of fruit. Not much on the nose or finish.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
40403,Field Stone 2007 Staten Family Reserve Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley),"Big, tough, gutsy, fruity, tannic. In other words, Petite Sirah, and classic at that. Shows very ripe, deep and long-lasting flavors of blackberries, blueberries, currants, chocolate, cedar and spices, in a bone-dry, full-bodied red wine. Good now, and should develop over a decade.",35.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
40405,Gustafson Family 2007 Dry Creek Mountain Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",28.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
40407,Zaca Mesa 2007 Roussanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bone dry, ultra-crisp in acidity, and lean in mineral flavors, this barrel-fermented, lees-aged Roussanne is the opposite of rich. But it's enormously elegant, and its leanness contains subtle hints of Meyer lemons, grapefruits, toast, yeast and cold, hard steel. A sommelier's dream for pairing with very complex dishes.",25.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
40423,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2007 Vixen Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
40735,Dunham 2007 Lewis Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dunham's Riesling, from the same vineyard that supplies grapes for the winery's best red wines, is a rich, luscious, off-dry wine, fresh and loaded with flavors of just-picked peaches.",26.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
40751,Ballentine 2007 Block 9 Reserve Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A beautiful Zin, dry and complex, showcasing perfectly ripe fruit and sweet Napa tannins.

40757,Bonterra 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"A little on the sweet extracted side, but balanced with rich, fine tannins and just-in-time acidity. The blackberry, currant, raspberry and cocoa flavors will play well against a grilled steak.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
40758,Cayuga Ridge Estate 2007 Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Aromas of honey and lemon lead into semi-dry flavors of tropical fruit and citrus on the palate, Refreshing in character with a spicy undertone, the wine still has a semi-sweet, fruity roundness that can handle richer dishes. Pair with lobster, shellfish.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
40759,Château Bianca 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Bright and tasting of ripe pear, this is a textural, tart, tangy wine nicely set up for pastas, light seafood and poultry. Despite the nominal residual sugar, it comes across as almost entirely dry, with just a hint of fruit sweetness.",12.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
40791,Belhurst 2007 Traditions Merlot (New York),"A winning combination of sweet and savory, Belhurst's Traditions smells deliciously of syrupy boysenberry jam amidst the backdrop of a rustic barnyard. On the palate, juicy, ripe black fruit flavors gain complexity from a rich, earthy mushroom notes in the midpalate. Luscious and smooth with medium body and soft acidity.",27.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
40903,Ravenswood 2007 Old Hill Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"You can quibble with the price, but there's no doubt about the quality of this Zin. It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years.",60.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
40948,Somerston 2007 Highflyer Centerline Red (Napa Valley),"Lots of ripe cherries, blackberries and dried herbs in this young, vigorous wine. Shows considerable power and authority, at the loss perhaps of some charm and elegance. Drink it over the next 6–8 years.",28.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
41305,Trinchero 2007 Central Park West Vineyard Petite Verdot (St. Helena),"The underlying wine is thin in fruit, so what stars is oak, with its toasty, caramelized aromas and flavors. It's also fiercely tannic. You'll find some briary blackberries and blueberries, but the wine illustrates why Petit Verdot is best used as a blender.",50.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
41308,Mounts 2007 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Heavy tannins, which accentuate the acids, lock this wine down now, making it astringently dry and tart. Underneath all that are deep, earthy flavors of blackberries, coffee and pepper. Doesn't seem to be ageworthy, so drink up.",32.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
41313,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Bordheauxd Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune.

41654,Snoqualmie 2007 Whistle Stop Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Herbal and dill infuse the light flavors, and the tannins feel as if they've been softened up in the winemaking process. The wine does a quick fade.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
41657,Banknote 2007 The Vault Red (Napa Valley),"Tastes new-oaky and a bit overextracted now, even overripe, with black and red currant, caramel and vanilla flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Doesn't seem like the ambiguities will age out, so drink now.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
41662,William Church 2007 2 Spires Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A sharp, herbal blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, showing hints of resin in its aromas. The pale red fruit flavors are tart, light, and simple.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
41666,Mercer 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blocky, toasty, chewy wine with a flavor mix of herb and earth and berries. The tannins are rough and leave a slightly bitter impression.",22.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
41755,Blackstone 2007 Sonoma Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"A nice, fleshy young Merlot, vibrant and elegantly constructed. It's ready to drink now for its silky mouthfeel and dry, complex flavors of cherries, red currants, tobacco, herbs and cedar.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
41762,Estancia 2007 Shiraz (Central Coast),"Dark, bone dry and tannic, a full-bodied wine whose tartness and astringency call for rich fare, like beef stew.

41812,Selene 2007 Frediani Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A delicious, complex Merlot, although all the parts haven't come together and it needs time in the cellar. It's extraordinarily rich in oak-inspired black cherries, red currants, violets, cocoa, spices and sweet sandalwood, and it should develop nuance and bottle bouquet after 2012.",35.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
41819,Tertulia 2007 Les Collines Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A real success, this intensely spicy Syrah loads in mouth-softening flavors of buttermilk, cocoa and cinnamon.

42177,Kana 2007 Katie Mae White Table Wine White (Yakima Valley),"This bottling changes dramatically from year to year; here it is 100% Riesling rather than a blended white. A little sweet and a little sweaty, it falls flat on the palate, leaving you wondering why a wine barely a year old is already entering old age. Drink up.",14.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
42180,Leaping Horse 2007 Merlot (California),"Tastes harsh and minty, like toothpaste, with some fruit flavors of cherries and blackberries. If you take the price into account, it's not bad.",6.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
42260,Schulz 2007 Lampyridae Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),"This is a very big Zinfandel, exuberant and lush in fruit.

42262,Spicerack 2007 Punchdown Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"A little on the soft side, which limits ageability, but an awfully good wine. It's rich and dense in ripe blackberries, currants, teriyaki beef, cola, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, wrapped into dense but fine tannins. Drink now.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131

42385,Dolce 2007 Late Harvest Wine Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% Sémillon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc.",85.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
42445,Turnbull 2007 Fortuna Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"One of the best Merlots of the vintage. Does what Merlot's supposed to do, flatter the palate with soft, voluptuous richness.

42787,Imagine Moore 2007 TRUTH Red Table Wine Red (Finger Lakes),"Notes of sweet vanilla and biscuit crumbs add a warm, sweet touch to the nose and palate of this elegant Bordeaux-style blend.

42835,Balboa 2007 Mith White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A rare gem, this Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
42842,Wellington 2007 Roussanne (Sonoma County),"As sweet as honey, with Lifesaver candy pineapple, golden apricot preserves, Meyer lemon custard pie and Asian spice flavors. Calls for very rich fare, such as scallops sautéed in butter, served with a creamy risotto.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
42854,Wente 2007 Sandstone Merlot (Arroyo Seco),"Totally delicious and so easy to like for its soft mouthfeel and luscious upfront fruit. Just wows with raspberries and cherries, with polished tannins, balancing acidity and a touch of smoky oak.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
42858,Tero Estates 2007 Tero Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This is a little rugged, a little more raw and less concentrated than the other releases from this new Walla Walla winery. The wood sticks out a bit, though it's a very tasty wine with supple red fruit, an soft earthiness, and light suggestions of sandalwood and spice.",24.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
42958,Olabisi 2007 King Vineyard Syrah (Suisun Valley),"Thick and meaty, this Syrah has an unusual-but-welcome aroma of marshmallow, surrounded by notes of dark plum, black currant and a streak of dark chocolate. With a long, lingering and rich finish, this will be great to drink in the winter months.",30.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
43072,Dutton Estate 2007 My Father's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"You want lush, plush and opulent in your California Syrah? Here you go.

43079,Mauritson 2007 Madrone Spring Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rockpile),"A fabulous Petite Sirah for serious fans of the variety. Shows typically big tannins and high alcohol, with full-bodied, concentrated mountain flavors of blackberries, currants, roasted meat and pepper. Best of all is the balance of its parts, resulting in elegance despite the power.",37.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
43080,Northstar 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From a superb year, this wine saw all French oak, but an ongoing reduction in exposure to new barrels brought the percentage down to 60%. Young and muscular, the blend of black fruits, sweet oak and toasty spice is focused and compelling. Pure fruit flavors include black cherry and plum, smooth and concentrated, with a smoky kick in the lingering finish.",40.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
43081,Sequel 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pungent and spicy, dark and brooding, this wine brings it with deep, sappy berry fruit and overtones of meat and garrigue, all with muscle and verve. Tannins are firm and hard, showing some ripe stem and earth flavors, and plenty of barrel toast. Muscular and warm, this Syrah walks the line perfectly between the Rhône and Barossa.",55.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
43155,Shooting Star 2007 Blue Franc Blaufränkisch (Washington),"This opens with lots of spice, tart and light red fruits and some strongly herbal tannins. There is a big wash of sweet baking spice, source unknown, that offsets the stemmy and herbal quality of the fruit.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
43157,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Rock Star Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short.",44.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
43159,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2007 Picazo Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley),"Too sharp and aggressive in tart acidity, which emphasizes the tannins, making it feel overly astringent.

43395,Doyenne 2007 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Lush, polished and detailed, this is as elegant as any Washington Syrah can be.

43498,Keenan 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms.",36.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
43535,Wellington 2007 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"This is a soft, rather one-dimensional Merlot. It's certainly flavorful in cherries, red currants, cola and cedar, but There's not a whole lot going on.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
43777,Concannon 2007 Nina's Cuvee Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),Smells and tastes over-oaked; a little too acidic and thin in flavor. The oak tannins are strongly astringent.,30.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
43786,Agate Ridge 2007 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley),"A grapey wine, forward with light, pretty cherry candy flavors. It starts out well, then doesn't build into anything, but rather fades quickly into a watery, generic red.",27.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131

43928,Mutt Lynch 2007 Canis Major Perotti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Basically a high-alcohol fruit bomb, with jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries. The heat from 15.5% alcohol gives it a chili pepper burn. Defines that style, for those who like it.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
43930,St. Francis 2007 Cuvée Lago Red (Russian River Valley),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this wine is soft and tannic, with a puckery mouthfeel. The cherry-berry flavors are jammy. Ready now.",40.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131

43934,Jekel 2007 Merlot (Arroyo Seco),"Firm, dry tannins mark this Merlot, and it has nice mouthwatering acidity. But it's a little unripe, with some green, herbaceous flavors accompanying the cherries and spicy plums.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
43941,Prager 2007 Sweet Claire Late Harvest Riesling (California),"Good for its apricot, vanilla and buttercream flavors, but really lacks the sweet richness that an expensive dessert wine needs. It falls apart mid-palate, and turns watery on the finish.",28.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
43945,Carr 2007 Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A hot, rather brutal wine. High alcohol combines with high, hard tannins to make for a real textural challenge, despite interesting cherry, licorice and Canadian bacon flavors. Drink now.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44060,Ottimino Vineyards 2007 Von Weidlich Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Shows a delicate texture, almost Pinot Noir-like in lightness, yet offers a blast of berry, spice, tobacco, cola and bacon flavors that are lusty and ripe. The grapes come from the Green Valley, and the alcohol is low while acidity is high. Beautiful and classy, a Zin to drink with everything from salmon and steak to tuna and short ribs.",36.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
44155,St. Francis 2007 Red Splash Red (Sonoma County),"Hearty and rustic, this is a blend of several varieties—including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah—it's an all-purpose, slightly sweet red wine for drinking with spaghetti and meatballs, burgers and chili.",10.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

44326,Crauford 2007 Highlander Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A beautiful wine that shows how Napa Valley is right up there with the best of California's Sauvignon Blancs. Dry and crisp, it was made in the interesting way of combining stainless steel and oak for textural complexity. The citrus, lemongrass, fig and pepper flavors have a touch of buttercream and smoke in the finish.",18.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
44360,A Donkey and Goat 2007 Fenaughty Vineyard Syrah (El Dorado),"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.",35.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
44361,Davis Family 2007 Guyzer Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"This is a big, strong, gutsy Syrah, a powerhouse of jammy blackberries, currants, bacon, pepper and sandalwood.

44484,Pey-Marin 2007 The Shell Mound Riesling (Marin County),"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.",24.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
44586,Scott Harvey 2007 Mountain Selection Barbera (Amador County),"This is a very, very dry, acidic, tannic wine. It's the opposite of lush. There's something old-fashionedly rustic about it, the kind of wine they drank 50 years ago. But it is firm and clean, with insistent flavors of cherries and coffee, and will pair well with tomato sauce dishes.",20.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
44614,Alexandria Nicole 2007 Mr. Big Petite Sirah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Big indeed, this is very dark and concentrated, with fruit-powered flavors wrapped in sweet baking spices. An impressive Petite Sirah that does not seem too tannic; the barrel flavors—vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar—more than compensate, and the fruit is round and ripe enough to hold the focus.",42.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
44635,William Church 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Citrus rind and grapefruit fruit flavors are set against more floral highlights. It's as refreshing as a gin and tonic, and even carries a hint of quinine flavor in the finish. The wine is sturdy and consistent through the middle and finishes with a gentle fade.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
44711,Saddleback Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is dry, medium bodied and extraordinarily rich, bearing flavors of baked black-cherry pie, mocha and grilled prosciutto, with a long, spicy finish. So what if it's too soft, or if there's a trace of overripeness? It's all part of the wine's personality.",36.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
44842,Municipal Winemakers 2007 Bright Red Red (Santa Barbara County),"This southern Rhône-style blend is very soft and as sweet as a fruit pastry. It has jammy or pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, red plums and cocoa, with a dusting of pepper and cinnamon.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44873,Kana 2007 Dark Star Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Syrah and Grenache, still hard and tannic. The flavors of earth, coffee and dark toast conceal whatever the fruit might have to say, leaving a trail of bitterness in the finish.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44877,RiverAerie 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sharply defined aromas, with a little funk at the base, lead into tart red fruits and flavors of slightly bitter herbs. The fruit fades quickly, leaving tart flavors of stem and leaf in its wake.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44890,Calcareous 2007 Reserve Estate Mourvèdre (Paso Robles),"Shows all the difficulties of succeeding with this quirky variety in California. The problem isn't ripeness, because this wine brims with cherries and chocolate. Its limitation is structure. Badly needs firmness, elegance, dryness, acidity, lower alcohol.",42.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44896,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Curry Creek Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"This wine offers lychee, apple and pear on the nose and palate and is both fresh and floral.

44897,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Citrus, apple, spice and flowers on the nose and palate give this pretty wine dimension. It's a simply good sip that will pair well with spicy cuisine and seafood.",36.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44899,Kokomo 2007 Timber Crest Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Very ripe, almost sweet, like raspberry, cherry and blackberry purée with a sprinkle of brown sugar, cinnamon and pepper.

44904,Terry Hoage 2007 Skins Grenache (Paso Robles),"A bit one-dimensional, with jammy red cherry pie filling flavors that taste sweet and glyceriney. Tasty, but cloys after a few sips. Ready now.",38.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
44908,Peachy Canyon 2007 Vortex Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Somewhat musty, with a sweaty sox smell that interferes with the fruit. The flavors are of sweet black currants, and acidity is quite soft. Drink now.",36.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
44913,Hudson-Chatham 2007 Empire Red (Hudson River Region),"Cherry, blueberry, tea…this combination of Cab Franc from the Finger Lakes, Merlot from Long Island, and Baco Noir from the Hudson Valley is aged 24 months in oak and offers ample spice because of it. The black fruit/red berry is balanced by a minerality and a clean finish.",22.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
45229,Spindrift Cellars 2007 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"Spindrift is the little winery that could, and makes excellent wines at consumer-friendly prices, from a variety of grapes that showcase all the strengths of Oregon. This lovely bottle is spicy and tart, yet full-flavored with a mix of lime, lemon, pineapple, pear and rind that gracefully runs into a midpalate that is full and spicy. The sharp acids keep it lively and refreshing, and the finish is nothing short of remarkable in a wine at this price.",16.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
45275,Lionheart 2007 McGinley Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara),"A bit green, with thin flavors of citrus and herbs. Although it's dry and crisp, this Roussanne lacks richness.",30.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
45277,Leaping Horse 2007 Shiraz (California),"Pretty basic red wine, with a tough, tannic mouthfeel and not much fruit, but dry and balanced, with lots of pepper. Sipped from a plastic cup at a big party with pizza and Buffalo wings, it's fine.",6.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

45641,Beckmen 2007 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"Deliciously drinkable, this is one of the best California Grenaches in recent memory. Complexity is not Grenache's strong point, but lusciousness is, when the wine is well made. The cherry pie filling, raspberry tart and cinnamon spice flavors, enriched with smoky sandalwood, are wrapped into pure, fine tannins. Drink now.",48.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
45717,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 135 Syrah (Central Coast),"Grapy and fruity, like it's fresh out of the fermenter. Also sweet and soft, with a melted jam consistency and taste. Drink this simple wine now.",12.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

45733,Fasi Crest 2007 Private Reserve Syrah (Madera),"A bit too sweet for comfort. The tannins are soft and refined, and the blackberry, cocoa and spice flavors are just fine. But that sugary finish makes it unbalanced.",24.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
45734,Hyatt 2007 Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills),"You may or may not fancy the blue bottle, but the juice inside is a good example of Yakima Valley Riesling. Tea, honey and lemon flavors are co-mingled; and the 5% residual sugar adds sweetness without becoming grainy or cloying.",9.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
45742,Merry Edwards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Here's a charming, friendly Sauvignon Blanc that will go well with a huge range of food.

45755,Three Rivers 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though not labeled as such, this 75% Sauvignon Blanc/25% Sémillon blend is moderately ripe, lightly toasty, and a well-balanced, all-purpose white wine for poultry and richer seafood.",19.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
45756,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2007 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Mendocino's Anderson Valley is one of the best sources of Gewürztraminer in California, and this polished bottling shows why. The wine is brisk and clean, with potent flavors of tropical citrus fruits, flowers and a wild array of Asian spices, all wrapped into a creamy texture. It's a little sweet on the finish.",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
45815,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen 2007 Eroica Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Riesling collaboration between Chateau Ste. Michelle and Ernst Loosen is no longer unique, but the wine has been fine-tuned over the years and sets a consistently high standard. This may be the most acidic ever made, but it is juicy rather than sour, and has a textural creaminess that adds both depth and length. The fruit flavors mix ripe apple and Mandarin orange, with hints of sweet lime and wet stone.",22.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
45820,L'Ecole No. 41 2007 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Sémillon is quite dry, with an unusual mouthfeel that is a bit like chewing on beeswax, honeycomb without the sweetness of honey. It's a beautifully scented wine with a beguiling mix of floral and spice, suggestions of cinnamon, baking spice and body powder. Following on the palate are firm yet supple flavors of melon, pear and hints of baked apple, gliding into a smooth and satisfying finish, which resonates with hints of buttered toast.",16.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
45990,àMaurice 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits. Sweet tobacco and baking spices lead into a lush, fruit-loaded core, ripe with berries and plums. The finish—thick and textural and darkly chocolaty—wraps around polished, elegant tannins.",35.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
46000,Kent Rasmussen 2007 Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rutherford),"Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many “Pets,” it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.",40.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
46138,White Oak 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"An ultra-dry, solid Merlot, filled with hard tannins and zingy acidity. Deep down under are some pretty good black cherry and cedar flavors. Your gamble is to cellar it, as it's just too tough to enjoy now.",26.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
46139,Acorn 2007 Alegria Vineyard Sangiovese (Russian River Valley),"Lots of sweet cherry fruit in this polished red wine, which also shows the char and cedary flavors of oak barrel aging. It's gentle in tannins and has enough acidity for balance. A nice, everyday wine that brings to mind well-sauced pasta dishes.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
46151,Chiarito 2007 Estate Bottled Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Juicy as a dark plum with a raspberry chaser, this 80-case Petite Sirah gets better and better as it opens, revealing itself to be mellow and rustic, yet big and broad-shouldered. It would make the perfect pairing with a plate of cheesy pasta, meat sauce and crusty garlic bread, or anything with pancetta.",30.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
46360,William Hill Estate 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Tannins and acids make for a hard, resistant mouthfeel on this three-year-old Merlot. But the flavors are very rich, suggesting black and red cherries, red currants, violets and milk chocolate. Drink it with a well-marbled steak to break through the astringency.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
46635,Divine Llama 2007 In a Heart Beat Red (Yadkin Valley),"Charred oak, green herbs and vanilla spice notes mix oddly. The palate is soft and plush, with notes of sweet mocha and chocolate, but also a bit tired and chalky with faint tannins in the background.",18.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
46636,Fiddlehead 2007 Happy Canyon Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A problematic wine, with unripe, green flavors. The citrus fruits are marred by the herbal taste of boiled vegetables.",25.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
46673,Bardessono 2007 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Harsh and tannic now, with a flood of primary fruit blackberries and dark chocolate washed with black pepper. Despite the scour, it's a well-structured, bone-dry wine, with noble Napa tannins. And it is Petite Sirah. Give it at least four years in the cellar.",37.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
46688,Derby 2007 Pinot Noir Sparkling (San Luis Obispo County),"Made 100% from Pinot Noir, this bubbly has an orange copper color, and is full-bodied and dry. The flavors are of raspberries, strawberries and yeast, and the all-important mousse is refined. A little eccentric, but try it with sushi.",54.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
46886,Willow Crest 2007 Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"There is plenty of green tea flavor running through the fruit and the tannins here, along with dark cherry and bitter chocolate. A rustic, rough, but perfectly enjoyable take on pure Cab Franc.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
46902,Yorba 2007 Tempranillo (Amador County),"An easy-drinking red wine. It's silky, fruity and dry. You could substitute it as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir. Shows cherry and tobacco flavors, with a brisk scour of acidity.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
46903,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Defines Paso Robles Petite Sirah with its soft, luxurious texture and wonderfully ripe fruit.

Drink now for sheer lusciousness.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
47261,Baer 2007 Ursa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A five-grape Bordeaux blend dominated by Merlot and Cab Franc, this is a deft mix of grapes nicely melded into a complete and satisfying wine. It's anchored by black cherry and cassis fruit, supple and focused. Surrounding that core fruit are layers of smoke, black olive, pencil lead and coffee grounds. It resonates gracefully through a long finish.",35.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
47291,Pianetta 2007 Estate Bottled Syrah (Monterey),"Lots of acidity and black pepper in this bone-dry wine, giving it a scoury mouthfeel. But you'll find very rich, elaborate blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and bacon flavors. Drink now.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
47293,Taj 2007 Syrah (Los Carneros),"A smooth, ripe Syrah, easy and soft in the mouth, with richly extracted berry, mocha, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. It's a dry, balanced wine showing some real elegance.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
47430,Clos du Bois 2007 Fleur Late Harvest Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Enormously sweet, this decadent dessert wine has rich flavors of apricot jam, mandarin orange cream custard, crème brûlée, sweet smoked butter, vanilla and cinnamon.

47696,Garfield Estates 2007 V° Viognier (Grand Valley),"The nose on this Viognier is a touch off and slightly green, and on the palate, thin flavors lack the curvy allure of the variety.

47709,Taylor 2007 Nouvelle Génération Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Unbalanced, with weedy, grassy flavors side by side with sweet spearmint chewing gum and pineapple LifeSaver candy. Crisp acidity gives it the sweet-sour taste of certain Chinese sauces.",24.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
47710,Husch 2007 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Simple and a little one-dimensional in fruit and spice flavors, this dessert wine's main feature is sweetness. It has a flavor like the syrup from canned peaches.",20.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131

47773,Dragonette 2007 MJM Red (California),"You might want to lay this Syrah-based Rhône wine down for a year or two. Tasted in the early fall of 2010, it's sharp and fresh-fruity, which gives the cherry, raspberry and cocoa a jammy taste. The grapes come from Paso Robles and Santa Barbara County.",50.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
47781,Lujon 2007 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Though the alcohol comes close to 15%, this is still relatively light compared with other Spofford vineyard Syrahs.

47856,Keller Estate 2007 La Cruz Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus.

48440,Anthony Road 2007 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"White flowers, honey and toasted spice lead on this Riesling from New York, and on the palate, a backbone of elegant fruit prevails.

48483,Big House 2007 The Slammer Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Very dry and rather sharp in acidity, this Syrah offers cherry-berry flavors with a hint of herbs and spices. It turns bitter on the finish. Good price, but could use greater richness.",12.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

48495,Adelaida 2007 Michael's Estate Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Too soft in acidity, so the blackberry, currant, cherry liqueur and spice flavors have a curious jamminess. The softness and high alcohol emphasize sweetness, affecting the finish.",28.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
48497,Eagle Castle 2007 Royal Red Red (Paso Robles),"Thin in berry fruit and tannic, this rustic wine shows its high alcohol with a chili pepper burn through the finish. The flavors aren't rich enough for balance.",26.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131

48581,Shoup 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.",95.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131

48966,Robert Craig 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A good Zinfandel, dry and rich in the thick tannins you'd expect off Howell Mountain. The blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are liberally spiced with pepper. Loses a few points for a certain green herbaceousness.",50.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131

49000,Summers 2007 Checkmate Red (Napa Valley),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a best-of-barrels selection from Summers' various Cabs throughout Napa Valley. It's unquestionably a big wine, densely packed with blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also very young. The tannins pack a real punch. New oak, to the tune of 100%, is apparent in the buttered toast richness. Don't drink it now, good as it is. Give it until 2014, and it will develop long beyond that.",100.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
49046,Messina Hof 2007 Double Barrel Cabernet Franc (Texas),"Serious and solid, this Cab Franc delivers the goods with a complex nose of vanilla, coconut and orange clove pomanders layered over coffee and bittersweet chocolate.

49053,Hogue 2007 Genesis Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Meritage wines must be Bordeaux blends; otherwise, they can be all over the map. This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.

49054,Jaffurs 2007 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a pleasant, easy to drink Grenache. It's dry and tannic and filled with cherry flavors, sweetened with toasty oak. Wisely avoids many of the pitfalls Grenache is subject to. Drink now.",34.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
49062,Hard Row To Hoe 2007 Shameless Hussy Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Good fruit from the Riverbend vineyard brings earthy complexity to the wine.

49092,Shannon Ridge 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"With a sweet finish, this wine is filled with polished flavors of pears, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, honey and dusty spices. Crisp acidity provides balance.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
49432,Valley View 2007 Anna Maria Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Soft and peachy, with good midpalate concentration. This is a simple but fruity and flavorful wine, with just the vaguest suggestion of Meyer lemon in the finish.",22.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
49748,C.G. di Arie 2007 Petite Sirah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Pretty soft and delicate for a Petite Sirah, with the silkiness almost of Pinot Noir, except for the dark black color and firm, dry tannins. The blackberry, currant and leather have a touch of smoky cedar. Drink this pleasant wine with Mexican food, spare ribs, lasagna.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
49844,Wood Family Vineyards 2007 Madden Ranch Syrah (Livermore Valley),"The grapes for this immense, rich blueberry jammy Syrah come from NFL's John Madden's ranch. It's as big and loud as he can be, with not quite enough fruit or acid to overcome the alcohol, which even gets in the way of the nose. With a small percentage of Grenache blended in and the whole aged in 100% American oak (1/3 new), this style may appeal to some;, but can be interpreted as overly voluptuous, even on a second tasting eight hours after the first. Decant or, preferably, give it another 3–5 years.",24.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
49856,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Shows good blackberry and currant flavors, but there's something off in the mouthfeel. It's a sharpness, a rugged, tart green chlorophyll feeling that suggests unripe tannins.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
49859,Stuart Cellars 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah (Temecula Valley),"A dry, tannicly dessicated wine largely lacking in fruit. Tastes of alcohol and pepper, with just a sprinkle of blackberry juice.",40.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
49861,Estraié 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"Dry, tart in acidity and vegetal, this Sauvignon Blanc isn't ripe. It tastes like green beans with just a hint of citrus.",18.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131

49863,Beaver Creek 2007 Zinfandel (Lake County),"Soft, simple and sweet, with jellied raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Tastes like an inferior dessert wine.",29.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
49873,Buttonwood Farm 2007 Estate Grown Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Nowhere near ripe, with asparagus and boiled green bean aromas and flavors. Simply lacks richness of fruit.",22.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131

49876,Agate Ridge 2007 Cascade Terrace Red Red (Rogue Valley),"A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.",17.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
50089,Syzygy 2007 Saros 154 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This tightly-wound effort is built from 40% Malbec, 40% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.

50469,Souverain 2007 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Here's a good, rugged but dry and fruity Merlot for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry, berry, cola, herb and pepper flavors. Production was 5,000 cases.",17.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
50485,Brazin Cellars 2007 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Peppery and hot, almost Porty, with rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate, bacon and sandalwood. With smooth tannins, it turns soft and spicy on the finish.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
50495,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2007 Redemption Zin Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry, minty and sharp, and very peppery, with tobacco, wintergreen, cherry and currant flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

50606,Stevenot 2007 Verdelho (California),"Stevenot has a good record at producing this stainless-steel-fermented wine. It's a savory, complex white, with high acidity framing honeyed flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, papayas, pine tar, slate and vanilla, with a hint of petrol. That sweet-tart tension makes the wine the perfect foil for Asian fusion fare.",14.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
50610,Londer 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Shows the crisp, dry Alsatian interpretation that Anderson Valley gives to Gewürz. The wine bursts with Asian spices that titillate the palate, alongside Mandarin orange, Asian pear, lychee, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors that are delicious. Drink now for its youthful vivacity.",26.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
50616,Erath 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Erath is now part of the Ste. Michelle Wine Estates portfolio. The white wines, which have long been a strength of the brand, remain fresh and lightly fruity. The flavors of this young Pinot Gris suggest pear skin, grapefruit and lime, and there are bracing acids providing some additional lift. The '07 seems to show a bit more textural density than the previous vintage.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
50827,RoxyAnn 2007 Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Nice mix of citrus and tropical fruits in the nose, with a spicy burst on the palate.

50834,Ledson 2007 Cabernet Franc (Dry Creek Valley),"The flavors of oak and cherries stand out in this fruity, softly appealing wine. It's almost like a pastry tart, with the smoky-sweet pie crust.

50850,Cadaretta 2007 Windthrow Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cadaretta's Windthrow is a limited-release southern Rhône blend of 37% Syrah, 27% Mourvèdre, 18% Counoise and 18% Grenache. The fruit is just ripe enough, clean and juicy, with a spicy and tart mouthfeel. What's most surprising is the length—the wine seems to gather itself and push on through a full-throttle finish, adding nougat and vanilla custard to the mix.",50.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
50999,The Grapes of Roth 2007 Merlot (Long Island),"Over the last few years, veteran winemaker Roman Roth's eponymous Merlot has proven to be a consistent winner. His 2007 vintage is no exception. While intensely ripe with a rich, almost raisined black-fruit character, it's balanced with hints of granite, smoke and brine that all lend a savory, earthy tone. Penetratingly tannic and robust in structure, it's a wine to decant now, or cellar through 2019–2021.",44.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
51149,Curtis 2007 Roussanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dryish and very fruity, this Roussanne has pleasant flavors of oranges, pineapples, orange honey, roasted hazelnuts and smoky oak. Crisp acidity makes it taste bright and clean.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131

51358,McGregor 2007 Rob Roy Red Red (Finger Lakes),"Hints of black coffee, dried lavender and herb add punch to the lean plum and cherry flavors of this medium-bodied Cabernet Franc blend.

51744,Chiarito 2007 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Mendocino),"John Chiarito is making Italian varieties like Nero d'Avola and Negro Amaro––as well as estate-grown Petite Sirah and Zinfandel––on the outskirts of Ukiah, from his basement winery. There he combines an Old-World sensibility with New World techniques. He's nailing it here with a rustic, tannic but intensely delicious Zin full of berry aromas and a spicy finish. Big and hearty, this wine has soul.",21.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
52114,Ardenvoir 2007 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Silky and luscious, this extraordinary Sémillon from the makers of the Chateau Rollat red wines sends up cascading scents of orange blossom, orange peel, citrus and light tropical, moving into the mouth with beautifully integrated fruits dappled with honey and tea. Elegant and impressively long, it concludes with a light kiss of toast.",22.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
52145,Pellegrini Vineyards 2007 Estate Grown Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"This medium-bodied Merlot boasts an abundance of ripe, juicy black-cherry and plum flavors, but with a shade of savory green herbs that persist on the palate.

52377,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown G-S-M (Suisun Valley),"A polished, friendly wine, soft and gentle in the mouth, and carrying ripe flavors of cherries, black raspberries, mocha, bacon and pepper. Nice now if you want a dry, medium-bodied red. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
52407,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"With its slightly sweet notes of pineapple pie, dates and vanilla, this zesty Sauvignon Blanc is nice to sip as a cocktail. It will also pair well with a smoky ham sandwich with Dijon mustard.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
52438,Cockerell 2007 Terroir Coquerel Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is a complex young wine, made in the white Bordeaux style. It has been barrel fermented and aged on the lees. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it shows a grassy, hay quality that dries out the citrus fruit and apple fruit, giving the wine a bone-dry feel. Very fine and near the top of Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs.",37.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
52520,Wellington 2007 Le Pique-Nique Rosé (Sonoma Valley),"This Syrah-Zin blend is forward in jammy raspberry, cherry, herb tea and spice flavors. It's simple, but crisp acidity gives it a firm, clean finish.",14.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
52672,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley),"Lots of peppery, gooseberry and citrus flavors in this dry, crisply acidic wine. It has the clean, zesty mouthfeel of almost all Edna Valley white wines, and satisfies for its depth and finish.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
52683,Tablas Creek 2007 Rosé (Paso Robles),"Tastes a bit on the sweet, sugary side, but with the crisp acidity, it's balanced and elegant. The cherry, raspberry, lemongrass, vanilla, peppery spice and smoky wood flavors will work well against Thai or Vietnamese fare.",27.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
52948,Arrow Creek 2007 Coastal Series Meritage (California),"A little bitter and raw, with irregular tannins and a green edge of mint to the cherries and blackberries. Drink this country-style wine with simple fare.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
52963,Covey Run 2007 Quail Series Fumé Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of this Sauvignon Blanc carry a lot of perfume, as if dusted with talcum powder. In the mouth it is soft and tastes lightly of melon and apple, again with a rather odd impression of sweet powder. Serve it well chilled.",9.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
53051,Dominican Oaks 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Minty and green, with pronounced gooseberry and feline scent aromas and flavors. This bone-dry, acidic wine needs rich food for balance, like goat cheese.",14.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
53063,Silverado 2007 Miller Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Yountville),"Starts out smelling sulfury, and slow to burn off. Then turns jammy sweet in the mouth, with sugary flavors of pineapples, green apples, honeysuckle and vanilla.",20.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
53113,Gorman 2007 The Albatross Red (Red Mountain),"One third Petit Verdot, which really shines here, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon. The PV brings intense floral aromas, dense but supple tannins, the deep color and the cassis-laden fruit. Tarry, tannic, grainy and powerful, this is a potent wine with particular appeal to lovers of the Petit Verdot grape.",80.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
53123,Guardian 2007 Stillwater Creek Vineyard The Wanted Red Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Strong, full-bodied, tannic and muscular, this 50-50 blend of Cab Sauvignon and Cab Franc seduces you with sweet berry fruit, backed with stiff tannins and well-modulated streaks of iron and earth. For Cab freaks this is a gold mine of flavor, but it will need decanting or cellaring. It should keep for a decade or more.",37.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
53303,Castello di Amorosa 2007 Il Barone Red (Napa Valley),"Doesn't say so on the label, but it's Cabernet Sauvignon. However it's utterly unlike most other Napa Cabs in the dryness and tartness. Almost like a Chianti, with bone-dry cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors, scoured with tannins, that finish with a cut of acidity.",75.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
53311,Trinchero 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A good wine, dry and tannic, but a little one-dimensional in richness. Shows pretty flavors of red and black cherries, with a hint of mint and cocoa. Could be lusher and offer more layers. Call it elegant rather than opulent. Drink now.",50.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
53493,Hogue 2007 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is off-dry, roughly 2% residual sugar, and it nicely balances the sugar and the acids, using the floral and spicy character of the grape to fill out the middle. It's a pretty wine, fruity with peach, melon and grapefruit.",10.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
53496,Chandler Reach 2007 Monte Dulce Sangiovese Rosé (Yakima Valley),"This is tasty, with strawberry and watermelon flavors, moderate sweetness and crisp acids. In short, an excellent summer sipping wine.",14.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
53509,Adler Fels 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A rich, polished Sauvignon Blanc that's dry and spicy, with long, deep flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, green apples and figs. Nice with charcuterie and onion rings.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
53630,Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2007 Occidental Road Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of complex flavors in this bone-dry wine, and they range well beyond berry-cherry fruit into more interesting realms of leather, coffee, unsweetened cocoa, bacon, pepper spice and minerals. The wine shows a brisk acidity, and the tannins are intricate. Feels a bit austere and aloof now, withholding its best. Should offer more in 3-5 years, but not much beyond that before the fruit collapses.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
53732,Côte Bonneville 2007 DuBrul Vineyard Carriage House Red (Yakima Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend includes 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot and 14% Cab Franc. It's a balanced and fine-tuned effort, with a lovely mix of tart, sleek, red and purple fruits. There's a nice underpinning of dried herb, ripe tannins, and a graceful, lingering finish. At almost six years of age, the wine remains fresh and lively.",50.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
54072,Swanson 2007 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley),"Swanson does a good job of crafting a dry, crisp, mouthwatering Pinot Grigio with little or no oak influence. The acidity is juicy, making the apple, citrus and wildflower flavors savory. Good white with today's wide range of ethnic fare.",21.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
54403,Cabot Vineyards 2007 Confluence Red (Humboldt County),"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah and 20% Merlot has a fruity nose, the Syrah's leathery-ness is quite strong, surrounded by raspberry sweetness and red cherry from the Cab and Merlot. Although it's been in bottle some time, the finish is grippy and strongly tobacco-infused.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
54501,McCrea Cellars 2007 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Round, ripe and quite pretty cherry fruit flavors, showing a hint of loam and a briny note.

54534,Ehlers Estate 2007 Merlot (St. Helena),"A spectacular Merlot that could help resurrect this variety's reputation. It's as complex as anything from Napa, but is softer and more accessible than a Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 8% of the blend. Shows ripe flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberries and cola, almost like a Pinot Noir, except for the black currants that must come from the Cab, and of course the tannins, which are rich and fine. Simply gorgeous and compelling. now–2013.",45.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
54547,Tor 2007 Cuvée Susan Red (Napa Valley),"The Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend is from Howell Mountain. The Syrah is from the Hudson Vineyard, in Carneros. The wine is very fine, offering complex tiers of blackberries, black currants, cherries, raspberries, bacon, sweet Provençal herbs, spices and toasty oak. Very fine, with a sharp bite of acidity that calls for a good steak. Now and through 2014, at the very least.",48.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
54551,Black Ridge 2007 San Andreas Red Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A beautiful wine, from a winery that's piling up an impressive track record. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this 07 shows the balance of the vintage, with gorgeous tannins and focused characteristic of a mountain vineyard. The blackberry and black currant flavors have a firm minerality. Best now for its soft lusciousness, and should hold in the bottle for a good six years.",49.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
54552,Lucas & Lewellen 2007 Chenin Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"The winemaker left in a little residual sugar, which gives this pleasant wine a pineapple jam, green apple pie, vanilla sorbet and honeysuckle taste. It's balanced with crisp acidity. From the Los Alamos region, which should have its own appellation status.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
54607,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Zeigler Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"The ripeness of the grapes ran away in this wine, so that despite high alcohol, it still retains what tastes like residual sugar. The result is an excessively sweet wine. It's almost like a minor Port.",28.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
54634,Prager 2007 Blonde Tawny Port (Napa Valley),"Dark golden-brown, this dessert offering has whiskey-like aromas, fierce and strong. Described on the bottle as a white dessert wine, there's nothing specific to suggest varietal. Toffee plays around with coffee on the persistent finish.",48.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
54658,Forgeron 2007 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tight and reductive when first opened, with a mix of strawberry and raspberry fruit, and a hint of rubber ball. Let this one breathe! It's well-built, the fruit nicely matched to the French oak (two thirds new), and still a baby.",30.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
54660,Robledo 2007 Los Braceros Red (Sonoma Valley),"A delicious, easy wine to drink now. It's soft and fruity, with lots of candied raspberries, blackberries, anise, cocoa and spices.

55025,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Indian Wells Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As with the Indian Wells Cabernet, winemaker Bob Bertheau is using a considerable amount of Syrah (19%) to beef up the flavors. The Merlot here seems a bit light, it fades out in midpalate. There is a chalkiness to the finish, and the tannins are just a little green.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
55027,Goose Watch 2007 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),"Exhibits a pretty, almost opaque ruby color. Underneath heavy notes of vanilla and mocha from new oak, there's some nice cherry fruit as well as some char and barnyard flavors. Lacks depth but finishes on a pleasant boysenberry note. Drink now.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
55031,Keuka Spring 2007 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),"Opens with horsey notes typical of Lemberger, followed by tones of cherry pie and preserved lemons. Crisp, almost tart on the tongue with a short-to-medium finish of singed cherries. Drink up.",19.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

55077,Titus 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc is simple and jammy, like a wine version of melted black cherry jelly enhanced with an infusion of sweet, smoky, vanilla oak. It sure is fruity, but not very interesting in terms of complexity.",36.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
55079,Ancient Peaks 2007 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soft and extractedly jammy in blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, this Syrah is simple. The absence of structure makes it taste sweeter than it technically is.",16.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131

55189,Terre Rouge 2007 Roussanne (Sierra Foothills),"If this wine were drier it would be really good, because it's crisp in clean acidity, and has excellently ripe, rich flavors of peaches, butter-sautéed pineapples and vanilla. But it's sugary and a bit cloying on the finish.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
55190,Keuka Spring 2007 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"An earthy nose of cherry and spice, followed by flavors of tart cherry, cedar and violet, give this wine a distinctive character. It's balanced and easygoing—a great go-to red for game, turkey and beef.",19.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131

55381,Magnificent Wine Company 2007 House Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An all-purpose red wine, blending seven different grapes into a fruit bowl of forward berry flavors. Nothing challenging here, but the fruit is tasty and it might be compared to a nice Beaujolais—chill it and drink it outdoors on a hot summer day.",13.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
55445,Comartin 2007 Watch Hill Vineyard Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Somewhat thin and acidic in cherry fruit, and also overoaked. It's as if they thought the aromas and flavors of smoky wood would compensate for a simple wine. Lacks richness.",30.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
55509,Trio Vintners 2007 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A very pretty effort, the wine's strawberry and rhubarb flavors are balanced against spring herbs and hints of leaf. The Morrison Lane Sangiovese is blended with 15% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
55511,Waters 2007 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is the first vintage made in the brand-new winery that was finished just in time for crush in 2007.

55521,Keller Estate 2007 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp in acidity and delicious, with honeyed flavors of pineapples, green apples, Meyer lemons, vanilla and peppery spices. Finishes a bit sugary sweet, which detracts from pure balance.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
55537,Cave B 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The highlight of a thin lineup, Cave B's Sauvignon Blanc brings tart fruit flavors of lemon and lime, grapefruit and melon.

55600,DeLille 2007 Harrison Hill Red (Snipes Mountain),"From a single vineyard on Snipes Mountain, this is a forceful, dark and liquorous version of Harrison Hill, which often carries more herbal accents. Here it's fruity and floral, with scents of rose petals and concentrated raspberry and cassis. Still young and showing its alcohol, it needs some hours of decanting.",75.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
55610,Saviah 2007 Une Vallée Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Firm and polished, this peppery wine is dark and delicious, its wild berry mountain-flavored fruit dappled with earthy green tea and forest floor notes.

55665,Elyse 2007 Morisoli Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Immature now, with sweet, jammy berry fruit, currants and hard tannins, and the oak overlay hasn't been integrated yet. But there's a lot going on in this spicy, bold Zin. Give it 3–4 years.",37.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
55671,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2007 Terzetto Red (Napa Valley),"Rough-hewn and tannic in youth, this blend of one-third each Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot isn't showing much accessibility.

55707,Gloria Ferrer 2007 Royal Cuvée Brut Late-Disgorged Sparkling (Carneros),"The later disgorging of this wine made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay has given it a complexity of texture and flavor that's compelling, an older golden-apple and dried apricot sensibility that's intriguing on the nose and palate. Sizzling acidity makes for a crisp, dry wine, with lengthy finish.",40.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
55794,Nelms Road 2007 Merlot (Washington),"A vivid, fresh and fragrant wine, this is alive with a luscious mix of flavors from the intriguing mix of grapes, including Syrah, Dolcetto and Barbera.

55958,Fortress 2007 Novateur Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Red Hills Lake County),"Fortress's Sauvignon Blanc, based on the Musque clone, is seriously good at a fair price, and now they've blended it with some Sémillon to produce this slightly sweet dessert wine.

56457,Dumas Station 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another.",26.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
56520,Treleaven 2007 Late Harvest Vignoles (Finger Lakes),"Impressive and elegant, with flowers and zippy citrus, pineapple and melon on the nose and refreshing waves of lemon, lime and a touch of tropical fruit to round it out on the palate.

Ripe to the point of overripe, it shows flavors of blackberries, currants, cassis and raisins, liberally dusted with crushed black pepper and unsweetened cocoa.

56532,Hermann J. Wiemer 2007 Reserve Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lively, enticing, this wine offers aromas and flavors of apples and pears and a smack of spice.

A lingering spicy finish seals the deal.",26.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
56557,La Sirena 2007 Barrett Vineyard Syrah (Calistoga),"This Syrah tries to strike a balance between rich opulence and controlled elegance, and it largely succeeds. It's has exquisite tannins and fine acidity, finishing bone dry. The flavors are complex, immediately suggesting ripe blackberries, with notes of beef tartare, grilled wild mushrooms splashed with tamari, black pepper and minerals. You can draw analogies to the northern Rhône if you want. Will it age? Hard to say, but it's a great wine now.",75.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
56830,Twomey 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured.",50.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
56832,Ash Hollow 2007 Headless Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 95% Cabernet Sauvignon from the estate vineyards. Quite sour with lip-puckering cherry fruit, it thins out and finishes with hard, slightly chalky tannins.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131

57173,Sheldon 2007 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"Light in color and body, with a silky texture and cherry, cola, bacon and peppery spice flavors, this Grenache could be easily mistaken for Pinot Noir. It's a very nice wine to drink with a steak, lamb chop or pork loin.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
57176,Fenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),"Soft, round and leathery tannins give way to plum, cherry, cranberry and sage in this subtly rendered Cab Franc out of one of the Livermore Valley's most vaulted vineyards, an approachable version of California Cab Franc that's moderate in price and alcohol (13.9%).",26.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131

57427,Matchbook 2007 Syrah (Dunnigan Hills),"A perfectly serviceable Syrah with 9% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, almost black in color with savory meat and red berries on the nose and palate and soft edges all around.

Phillips.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
57726,Columbia Winery 2007 Small Lot Series Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This is spicy and complex; wonderfully aromatic with a mix of Meyer lemon, pineapple and peach.

58013,Hestia Cellars 2007 Meritage Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Meritage red is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, and 15% Petit Verdot. There are noticeable high toned aromas hinting at nail polish. The fruit is bright cherry and darker black currant, with milk chocolate coating the finish.

58423,Millésimé 2007 Le Reflexion Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This 100% Syrah hasn't even begun shedding its hard, dry tannins at the age of nearly seven years, and it probably never will. It's also overripe, with a porty finish.",48.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131

59207,Cave B 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Stainless steel fermentation has yielded a yeasty, beery wine. There's plenty of fruit, a bit too reminiscent of canned peaches, and a finish that seems constricted and short. Residual sugar is right around 2%.",22.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

59982,Camaraderie 2007 Malbec (Yakima Valley),"Blueberry and red currant fruit flavors, augmented with streaks of gravel and pencil lead, give this Malbec a firm spine.

59984,Gifford Hirlinger 2007 Stateline Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak.

It has a bit more concentration than its budget-priced Washington competitors, and the vibrant, clean fruit flavors match well with a wide variety of summer dishes.",9.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60355,Jorian Hill 2007 Beespoke Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes. Yet it lacks the vital structure a good Rhône blend wants in order to house all this richness. Drink now. Grenache-Syrah.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60356,Jorian Hill 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60358,Fog Head 2007 Blow Sands Syrah (Monterey),"A little soft in texture, but interesting for its mosaic of blackberry, pepper, smoked meat, currant and balsam flavors, and the way the firm tannins provide structure. This bone-dry, big-boned Syrah was grown in the San Bernabe Vineyard of the southern Salinas Valley.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60362,William Harrison 2007 Rutherford Red Red (Rutherford),"Starts off with oaky, jammy aromas of cherries and raspberries, and tastes a little sweet in fruit pastry, with the baked crust. Seems a little one-dimensional, although that dimension is a very delicious one. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.",80.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60365,Petroni 2007 Rosso di Sonoma Red (Sonoma Valley),"Somewhat rugged, with edgy tannins, but very flavorful, a nice wine to have with Italian-inspired pasta dishes. Made from Syrah and Sangiovese, with a splash of Cabernet, it's dry and tart, and shows blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60367,Rangeland 2007 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Here's a soft, high alcohol, slightly hot Zin, lacking in acidity. What it lacks in structure, it more than makes up for in sheer, exuberant taste. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, dried fruits, dates, bacon, prosciutto, vanilla, smoky sandalwood and all sorts of other umami flavors.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
60417,Kenefick Ranch 2007 Caitlin's Select Cabernet Franc (Calistoga),"Almost too ripe and fruity, with jammy, pie-filling blackberry and cherry flavors. Lots of oak, too, giving the wine a caramelized sweetness. A bit heavy-handed, but tasty. Drink now.",52.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
60531,Le Vigne 2007 Kiara Private Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"This is a great buy. It's soft, rich and dry, with the velvety texture you want in a nice Syrah. Shows complex flavors of berries, cherries, cocoa, licorice and crushed pepper, and feels really stylish. Gets better as it warms in the glass.",18.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
60541,Columbia Crest 2007 Stone Tree Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Columbia Crest makes a limited number of single vineyard reserves. This Zinfandel comes from what is emerging as the best site for that grape in Washington. Bright, tart, and full of sappy raspberry and red fruits, this young, ageworthy Zin has great penetration and punch. In style, it is closest to classic Dry Creek Zins from such producers as A. Rafanelli and Doug Nalle. Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, it's actually the Wahluke Slope AVA.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
60544,Nine Hats 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Nine Hats is a recently-introduced second wine from Long Shadows. Clearly this is great juice, though it is, inevitably, a bit of a mishmash blend. Tannins are a little rough, but as a $25 red this has plenty of high-priced flavor.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
60549,Andrew Murray 2007 McGinley Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This 100% Syrah comes from a warmer part of the valley, and it's certainly ripe. Shows flashy blackberry, currant, teriyaki beef, olive tapenade, pepper, sweet caramelized oak and dusty spice flavors that are delicious and long-lasting. The tannins are soft but pronounced, suggesting the wine will develop over the next two to three years.",32.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
60715,Lemelson 2007 Tikka's Run Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"The winery calls the 2007 Tikka's “less exuberant” than previous vintages; that is not necessarily a bad thing. The fruit is crisp and powerfully focused; layered with flavors of melon, green apple, Asian pear and fresh peas. Whole cluster pressed and fermented in a combination of tank and neutral barrels, this textural wine finishes with crisp, mineral accents.",19.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
60749,Girard 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"An appealing Cab Franc, among the better versions of the variety. Shows the weight and structure of a fine Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, except the flavors veer toward red cherries and red cherry liqueur. Drink now, with honey-baked ham.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
60751,Helix by Reininger 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This captures the gamy, herbal, earthy complexity of Washington Syrah, but mutes it somewhat behind a wall of raspberry fruit. Not a bad combo by any means! This one carries some stemmy flavors into the finish. Just enough to put a hard edge on it.",27.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
60795,Wrath 2007 877/Noir Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a generous, likable Syrah for drinking soon. It's dark in color, full-bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, plums, cola, anise, sandalwood and peppery spices. The soft tannins help the wine finish rich and silky.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
60799,La Fenêtre 2007 Alisos Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"There's a wildness to this wine, with spicy, Provençal herbs and briary tannins that frame the blackberry, currant, licorice, balsam and cedar flavors. It's tightly wound and dense now, not showing much elegance. But it's interesting and different and could well be an ager. Try after 2011.",33.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
60855,Veritas 2007 Doug & Mary Wolf Special Edition Reserve Cabernet Franc (Monticello),"This special edition release is perfect for those drinkers who enjoy the herbal and savory side of aged Cab Franc. Dried tobacco, jalapeño and red currant reduction start on the nose and carry to the medium-bodied palate. Streaks of graphite offer a bit of life to a wine that should be enjoyed soon. With its sandy tannins and still lively acid, enjoy alongside a lamb shank.",35.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
60898,Schramsberg 2007 Crémant Demi-Sec Sparkling (North Coast),"This is a pleasantly sweet bubbly. There's a honeyed, sugary edge to the citrus, tropical fruit, spice, vanilla and toast flavors, and the bubbles are smooth and fine. The majority grape is Flora, a cross between Sémillon and Gewürztraminer.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
61314,Monte Volpe 2007 Primo Rosso Red (Mendocino County),"A liquid tribute to old Mendocino, this wine is a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, with smaller proportions of Sangiovese, Carignane, Negromaro, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Syrah. Medium bodied with spicy black pepper, leather and stewed plum flavors, it would go perfectly well with burgers or pizza.",9.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
61346,Mark Moretti 2007 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Earns high praise for its deep, complex flavors that suggest fully ripened grapes, well-treated by the winemaker. Waves of blackberries, cherries, herbs, violets, pepper and spices flood the palate, leading to a long, rich, tannic finish. Best opened soon for its freshness.",38.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
61348,Papapietro Perry 2007 Timbercrest Farms Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Zin doesn't get bigger or riper than this. Floods the mouth with flamboyant blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. It's tannic and dry, but so fruity it's almost sweet. High alcohol aids in the impression of sweetness. Oaky, too, in the way of a Cabernet. Delicious and classic Dry Creek.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
61351,75 Wine Co. 2007 The Sum Red (Napa Valley),"Rich and dramatic, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah offers smooth, unctuous flavors of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and pepper. It's a seductively appealing wine, with thick, refined tannins and a dry finish. Should gain in the bottle over the next 4–6 years. Great price for the quality.",20.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
61366,Longboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley),"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
61463,Arger-Martucci 2007 Estate Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"Arger-Martucci hits bigtime with this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend. It marches in a different direction from the soft cult style, showing brisk acidity, hard tannins and relatively moderate alcohol. Yet there's nothing light about the complex blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. Wonderful to drink now, and it will reward aging over the next 5–6 years.",50.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
61527,Clos du Bois 2007 Rosé (Sonoma County),"This Syrah-Merlot blush has a pretty color, but there's not much going on, flavor-wise. It tastes like alcohol and acidity, with a tiny splash of cherry flavoring.",12.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
61624,Sherwood House Vineyards 2007 Sherwood Manor Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Generous and sweet on the nose, this dry, light-bodied Bordeaux-style blend presents wafts of cherry pie fillings garnished with sprigs of fresh mint. By contrast, the palate is sheer with sprays of tart sour cherry fruit. It's a pleasant food wine but finishes with a touch of grape tannin bitterness.",55.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
61661,Tolosa 2007 Salaal Red (Edna Valley),"Based on Syrah, this is a distinguished, upscale blend. It's bone dry and quite tannic, with crisp Central Coast acidity, but most importantly it shows deep, intricate flavors of blackberries, currants, licorice, cola and sandalwood. A very fine release from Tolosa.",42.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
61662,Novy 2007 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Here's a bold, rich, powerful Syrah, marked by huge fruit. Sometimes with these fruity wines, the winemaker loses control and produces a bomb. Not here. Superb tannins corral the blackberries and cherries, and a tug of earthy leather and carob provides grounding. What a great value.",19.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
61814,Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Gewürztraminer (Seneca Lake),"Sweet and pretty with a bouquet of florals and confectionary sugar on the nose, this light-bodied wine a shower of lychee, fresh rose petals and sugared black tea. Off-dry and a bit lush on the palate, it's a juicy, refreshing, easy-sipping wine.",17.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
61920,Navarro 2007 Cluster Select Late Harvest Riesling (Anderson Valley),"This bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine.",29.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
61927,Fleming Jenkins 2007 Madden Ranch Syrah (Livermore Valley),"A massive Syrah that impresses for sheer volume. It's full-bodied and rich in blackberries, black currants, bacon, black pepper, anise and smoky oak, folded into thick, ripe tannins. Tastes juicy and fresh now, perfect for a grilled steak, and should develop for up to five years before losing its fruit.",40.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
61935,Longoria 2007 Clover Creek Vineyard Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley),"One of the best California Tempranillos of this or any vintage, Longoria's '07 establishes a new benchmark for the variety. Finally we have a dry, crisp and complex Tempranillo, filled with cherry, red currant, tobacco, spice, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into polished tannins. A delicious, medium-bodied red wine to enjoy with lamb chops, game, or even roast salmon.",36.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
61991,Morse 2007 Ensemble G-S-M (Sierra Foothills),"Stewy at first, this gets better after opening and catching some air, developing into a straightforward Rhône blend, with soft tannins and strips of cinnamon and vanilla.",24.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
62037,Glen Manor 2007 Hodder Hill Red (Virginia),"With an opaque brick color and notes of toasty French oak, this wine announces its lofty ambitions. The fruit is subsumed by the oak right now but there is enough stuffing here to warrant aging for several years to allow for more integration. Smooth tannins suggest a lighter meat dish such as shepherd's pie.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62041,Terre Rouge 2007 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"There's a touch of unripeness in this wine that shows up as a taste of green peppercorn, although it's very subtle, and the blackberry and black cherry fruit quickly washes it away. Other than that, the wine is dry and rich in tannins. Drink now.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62048,Vin du Lac 2007 Barrel Select Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended with 18% Merlot, this shows a mix of black cherry, fig and sweet prune fruit flavors. Some smoke from barrel aging comes in, and it's good right up to the finish, which has a gluey undertone.",35.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62052,Raymond Burr 2007 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),"Modest in alcohol, which is nice, but it comes at the price of richness. This is a lean, earthy wine whose acidity and tannins co-star with the cherries and tobacco. Drink now.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62055,Bella 2007 Big River Ranch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Every effort seems to have been made to extract the maximum amount of richness from this wine, but the result is simply heavy, not to mention oaky and drily tannic. The tastes of are ripe mashed blackberries, anise, pepper and dark, unsweetened cocoa.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62352,San Juan Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Light red fruits, perhaps just a little stewed and herbal, with a soft mouthfeel and mocha-streaked finish.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
62365,Tertulia 2007 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a bit sweaty in the nose, with a mousy undertaste that takes some time to blow off. Sour and unresolved; nothing really connects here. Very tart, with unripe citrus, pale red fruits, and a little toast and chocolate.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
62537,Rivino 2007 Sangiovese (Mendocino),"Shows the rugged, rustic nature of most California Sangioveses, but with additional notes of interest to raise the score a few points. Dry and crisply acidic, but light and elegant in body, it shows flavors of cherries, tobacco, sandalwood, black pepper and Asian spices. Drink now.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
62544,Valley of the Moon 2007 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A nice, smooth, rich Zinfandel that shows classic flavors at a fair price. It's fully dry, with rich, fine tannins and ripe flavors of berries, currants, dark chocolate, cola, cedar and lots of peppery spices. Good now with broiled steak, beef tacos, juicy burgers and Thai beef dishes.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
62593,DiStefano 2007 domenica Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Bordeaux blend with a Right Bank inclination, this offers forward fruit aromas and flavors of bright, candied cherry. A puckery, peppery finish comes up quickly. Some 2007 Washington reds seem to be entering a dumb phase; this may need some extra bottle age to open up again.",20.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
62617,C.G. di Arie 2007 Southern Exposure Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"The Southern Exposure wines come from the original Grandpere Vineyard planted well over a hundred years ago. In this expression the wine shows olive, tar brick and leather qualities and is juicy if not a touch disheveled, with a long spicy finish.",35.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
63014,Hendry 2007 Hendry Vineyard RED Red (Napa Valley),"Big, heavy, extracted, tannic and dry. That pretty much sums up this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, with Petit Verdot in the majority. It's potent in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an undertow of minerals. Should age well over the next eight years, without necessarily becoming more distinguished.",38.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63465,Basalt 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is tasty, forward, juicy fruit—a fresh berry mix of strawberry, blueberry and raspberry. There is firm acidity to balance the tannins, which bring just a hint of herb. Well done; it lacks only some depth in the finish to bring the score up.",24.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
63533,Gramercy 2007 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Originally intended as a blending grape for the Tempranillo, this is now being separately bottled. The Alder Ridge Grenache is blended with 20% Syrah. It's a ripe, almost liquorous wine, with some alcoholic heat. Nonetheless, the Gramercy style, with an emphasis on acidity and minerality, along with tart red fruit flavors, comes through.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63538,Madrigal 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A polished, softly delicious Merlot, at a good price for the quality. It's dry and richly tannic, with complex flavors of black cherries, red currants, red licorice, Indian spices and sandalwood. Ready now, but only 200 cases were produced.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63541,Waters 2007 Forgotten Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Clean and fresh strawberry fruit flavors rush from the glass; while in the mouth the wine also reveals an earthier side of the Syrah grape. The fruit and loam are further enhanced with streaks of raw meat and seaweed; complex and long-lasting.,40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63542,Arbor Crest 2007 Connor Lee Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Since 1993 Arbor Crest has done this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc. As with all these wines the aromas set up the palate—scents of berry, tobacco and fresh ground coffee. In the mouth it carries on with very clean and fresh fruit, ripe and chewy/herbal tannins, excellent acid balance and a light bitter coffee finish.",18.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63547,Gramercy 2007 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from Les Collines, this perfectly expresses the house style—scents of strawberry jam, hints of pepper, and flavors that seem to focus on rocky minerality. An austere yet thrilling wine, almost like a Chinon, though this is Syrah, and not Cabernet Franc.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
63570,Dry Creek Vineyard 2007 Fumé Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"A fine Sauvignon Blanc and, at this price, a good value, especially for sommeliers, who can recommend it with a wide array of foods. Slightly sweet in the finish, it's crisp in acids, with pineapple, spearmint, lemongrass and vanilla flavors.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
63582,Husch 2007 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Technically, this Gewürz has a residual sugar of 0.8%. Taste-wise, that gives it a round, honeyed softness that nicely balances the high acidity, and makes the pineapple, guava and lychee flavors taste like they're baked into a rich, savory pie. An enormous blast of Asian spices kicks in on the finish.",14.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
63658,Mattebella 2007 Old World Blend Red (North Fork of Long Island),"There's a core of preserved black fruit in this Merlot-dominant Bordeaux-style blend, but also notes of leafy dill and stem that add a vegetal quality. Elegant and a bit lean on the palate, it finishes with persistent, yet finely textured tannins.",40.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
63785,Obsidian Ridge 2007 Half Mile Red (Red Hills Lake County),"Made from unknown varieties, this is a big, sturdy, tannic and dry wine, made from a high mountain vineyard in this Lake County appellation. There's lots to like in the blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with their edge of dark chocolate and bacon. The wine is a bit sharp, but that could be a function of youth. Give it a few years in the cellar. A wine to watch.",60.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
63800,C Square 2007 Merlot (Bennett Valley),"Bennett Valley is a little appellation in Sonoma County and it's been known as a good source of nuanced Merlot since Matanzas Creek specialized in the variety. This new bottling recalls those glory days. It's a fine Merlot, dry and silky and elegant, with ripe flavors of black and red cherries, chocolate and herbs. Try as a softer, gentler version to Cabernet.",28.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
64185,St. Supéry 2007 Élu Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"There's a lot of complex, youthful charm in this Cabernet-based wine, which was grown in both of St. Supery's estate vineyards, Rutherford and Dollarhide. It's very rich and ripe in blackberries, cassis, blueberries and dark chocolate, with a savory spiciness. This really defines the Napa style, and demonstrates the great success of the 2007 vintage.",65.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
64299,Sheldrake Point 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Sheldrake's Riesling begins with nosings of pear, apple and spice, and on the palate, offers apple and citrus with a minerally edge. Friendly and crisp, it's a good summer sip or cohort to Thai cuisine or grilled seafood.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64303,Lakewood 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Those who buy Riesling for its intense aromas will be disappointed with the subdued nose on this example from the Finger Lakes. Nonetheless, the palate delivers attractive stone fruit flavors of peach and apricot and the truly crisp, dry finish makes for a refreshing package.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64305,Long Point 2007 Dry Riesling (New York),"Long Point's Riesling starts with a fresh, vibrant fruit nose edged with citrus, and the crispness continues on the palate. The floral fruit flavors are balanced with a citric, zingy zap. Overall, a fun wine that will pair well with spicy cuisine and seafood dishes.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64309,Bogle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Very pungent in gooseberry aromas, this ultra-dry wine is crisp in mouthwatering acidity. The flavors are of grapefruits, orange rind, vanilla and spice.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64324,Pacific Rim 2007 Solstice Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The wine is finished at 1.2% residual sugar, but tastes bone dry. It's succulent and juicy, with floral aromas, stone fruits and hints of honeysuckle. Concentrated and dense, it is both bracing and long. The bottle was re-tasted on the second and third days after being opened and retained its crispness and vitality beautifully.",32.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
64505,Kenwood 2007 Gewürztraminer (Sonoma County),"Gewürz fans, including sommeliers, should buy this by the case. It's classic California, rich and zesty in acidity, with spice-tinged citrus, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. With an off-dry finish, it's perfect for Asian fare.",11.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
64515,Del Rio 2007 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"Estate-grown from the southern Oregon AVA of Rogue Valley, this Pinot Gris is significantly warmer and more volatile than those from farther north. Soft and tasting of tropical/bubble gum fruits, it's a wine that should be served cold and drunk soon.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
64748,Stuart Cellars 2007 Lopez Ranch Vintners Special Select Reserve Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),"This is a very dry and rather bitter wine, with a raisinskin toughness. It's not very generous in fruit, but is nuanced in its own way. Needs rich barbecue to tease out the blackberries and chocolate.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64750,Cliff Creek 2007 Merlot (Southern Oregon),"Quite tannic and oaky, this rough and chewy Merlot is constructed around a thin layer of cassis fruit. But the big flavors are the dark, earthy ones—raw wood and thick tannin.",19.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
64910,Arbor Crest 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is very fresh and nicely detailed, with just 13% alcohol allowing some of the more subtle Sauvignon Blanc flavors to show. Some of the oldest vines in the state—more than 35 years old—are a prime component. Melon, green apple, lime and grapefruit flavors all mingle; acids are just right and the balance could not be better for lighter seafood and poultry.",9.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
64924,Washington Hills 2007 Summit Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With its 10% alcohol, bright fruit and lush, round mouthfeel, this is more mainstream (and main meal) than the late harvest label would suggest. The sweetness is perfectly balanced against firm acids, and the fruit flavors combine citrus and peach with light streaks of honey.",8.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
65534,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A simple, fruity wine, sharp in acidity, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors, elaborated with sweet oak.",32.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
65547,Castello di Borghese 2007 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"While soft on entry with slightly pulpy, sweet plum flavors, this Cab Franc gains intensity on the midpalate as spicy bramble notes and soft tannins accumulate. Approachable in style, it's a pleasant everyday red with just a hint of leafy green on the finish.",25.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
65654,Carol Shelton 2007 Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Marked by dryness and some heat from alcohol, this wine also has a rich core of ripe cherries. It's very strong and powerful, not a Zinfandel that's shy or apologizes for its brashness. But that's the essence of Rockpile. Drink this sturdy wine now, and the ideal food pairing is barbecue.",33.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
65972,Kamiak 2007 Rock Lake Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend has a big, dark, toasty edge to the tannins, and plenty of ripe fruit. Meaty and rich, the color of ink, it skirts a pruney border, tosses in some earth and leather and soy, and overall shows plenty of power. A great drink-it-now wine.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
65975,Mettler Family Vineyards 2007 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Some Zins handle high alcohol well, and so it is with this lusty, delicious example from Lodi. It's soft and easy to drink, with rich flavors of berries, cherries, currants, smoky oak and spices that turn chocolaty on the finish.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
66047,Snoqualmie 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lightly spritzy, grassy and crisp, with melon, pineapple and grapefruit. Is there just a hint of sweetness to cut the grassiness?",7.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
66130,:Nota Bene 2007 Conner Lee Vineyard Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The wine is easy-drinking, smooth and tasty, really needing no further aging to show its stuff. Polished tannins, round sweet fruit, plenty of baking spices and a chocolaty finish—what's not to like?",32.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
66370,Dry Creek Vineyard 2007 The Mariner Meritage (Dry Creek Valley),"Delicious, if a little soft and sweet, with melted jam flavors of raspberries and cherries. Oak adds more sweetness in the form of caramel. Not quite up there with previous bottlings of this wine, but a pretty one to drink tonight.",40.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
66442,Scheid Vineyards 2007 Grenache (Monterey),"Here's a dry, elegant Grenache for drinking now. It has a silky texture, with slightly rough tannins and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mocha, pepper and herbs.",21.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
66443,Summers 2007 Four-Acre Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Somewhat sharp and tartly aggressive now in jammy fruit, with raspberry, cherry, wintergreen mint and cola flavors, sweetened with smoky wood notes. Doe not seem like an ager, so drink now with very rich meats, oils and cheeses to soften the hardness.",34.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
66448,Mazzocco 2007 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style.",40.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
66719,Elk Cove 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a fruit-powered wine, loaded with fresh pear, melon and tropical flavors. It shows no sign of having suffered from the wet, cool weather that hit Oregon during the 2007 harvest. It seems riper than the perfectly balanced '06 bottling, with lower acids and a streak of vanilla and coconut wrapping up the finish.",19.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
66736,Tildio 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It's a pleasure to find a sipping wine that gracefully displays a mix of honeysuckle blossoms, light apple, pear and peach, and a gentle wrap of firming acids. Elegant right through the finish.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
66742,Substance 2007 Mb Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The six red wines of Substance are nicely differentiated, this being the most dry and tannic, with penetrating berry fruit flavors defining the core. There's a wonderful sense of depth and the wine lingers in the mouth; quite dry but flavorful. The tannins are polished and ripe; one sip leads right into the next.",18.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
66902,Napa Station 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A little rough and ready around the edges, but nice and dry, with firm tannins framing black cherry, cola and oak flavors.",19.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
66920,David Girard 2007 Syrah (El Dorado),"Overtly sweet in cola, chocolate, black cherry purée, glycerine and sandalwood flavors. The sweetness could also be from high alcohol, as the mouthfeel is hot. Drink now.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
66938,Hanna 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Some people are sensitive to the green, minty gooseberry aroma that strongly permeates this wine. If you can deal with that, the flavors veer toward slightly sweet pineapples, peaches, melons and vanilla.",17.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
67018,Schramsberg 2007 J. Schram Brut Rosé  (North Coast),"Elegant and almost ethereal, this wine is tantalizing and irresistible. It shows sophistication, from the mysterious, earthy bouquet to the complex, well-aged brioche and peach flavors, as well as the almost gentle texture and refined finish. While full bodied, the wine has great balance, as all the tasty components join together to weave their magic.",150.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
67441,Kokomo 2007 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"The Yiddish word “zaftig” perfectly describes this Petite Sirah. It's big, powerful and fleshy, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, dark chocolate, licorice, bacon and peppery spices, all wrapped into significant tannins. A very nice example of the variety, it's dry and balanced, and should age for years.",27.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
67442,Rusack 2007 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A beautiful Syrah, dry, full-bodied and tannic, that shows lots of class and elegance at this price. It has rich, complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and oak, with earthy, leathery, bacon and licorice notes. Needs a few years to come around due to the tannins, or give it a good decant.",25.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
67454,A Donkey and Goat 2007 Fenaughty Vineyard Syrah (El Dorado),"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.",35.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
67489,Trefethen 2007 Double T Red (Oak Knoll District),"Slightly unripe, with an herbaceousness that interferes with the blackberries and currants, making the oak stick out uncomfortably. Sharp, too. But it's good and richly tannic, and dry. Made from all five traditional Bordeaux varieties.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
67494,Goats Trail 2007 Zinfandel (California),"This is a good, everyday Zin with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry and tannic and full-bodied, the way you want Zin to be, with modest flavors of cherries, currants, mint, pepper and tobacco.",11.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
67495,Hahn Estates 2007 Meritage (Central Coast),"This is a very ripe wine stuffed with blackberries, cherries and cocoa, but it's also pretty tannic, although sweet oak softens the blow. Feels lush and good, but rustic around the edges. Drink now with beef dishes.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
67500,Line 39 2007 Petite Sirah (North Coast),"A little weedy and green, but dry and very elegantly constructed, with good balance. Shows pleasant flavors of herbs, cherries, licorice and pepper. Represents a very nice wine for ten bucks or less.",10.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
67514,Koehler 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit on the sweet side, with lemonade, pineapple juice and vanilla flavors, but it's clean and crisply acidic. For those who like their Sauvignon Blancs in this fruit-forward style.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
67516,Milbrandt 2007 Traditions Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This fresh, clean, subtle wine offers green apple, melon and light citrus fruit, snappy acids and mouth-refreshing texture, all in a very light and moderately low-alcohol style.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
67523,Sunbox Eleven 2007 The Nice Catie's Corner Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),"Shows the rich flamboyance you expect in a Viognier, with enormously ripe tropical fruit, apricot, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail wine with hors d'oeuvres, like tempura dipped into soy sauce.",33.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
67542,Iron Horse 2007 Wedding Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"A beautiful wine, in the Iron Horse style, with plenty of ripe fruit balanced with crisp acidity. The lime, strawberry and raspberry flavors have a pleasantly yeasty edge, with a slightly sweet finish.",38.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
67709,Cardinale 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"A darkly colored, tannic Cabernet whose dry astringency keeps it from being thoroughly enjoyable now. Despite the astringency, however, it showcases an immaculate core of blackberries and black currants. Elegant and classy, it should age well throughout the decade.",300.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
67784,Sweet Valley Wines 2007 Double Barrel Red Blend Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This has a pruney character in keeping with the high 15.4% alcohol. It's dark and liquorous, beyond ripe, and finishes hot, with chalky, earthy tannins.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
67788,Tres Hermanas 2007 Demetria Estate Roussanne (Santa Barbara County),"Fruity and simple, with pie-filling flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and honeysuckle. Shows good coastal acidity, but could use greater depth and complexity.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
67797,Guenoc 2007 Victorian Claret Red (Lake County),"Distinctly sugary, which gives the blackberries and cherries a jammy sweetness. But it's clean and crisp. For those who like this style, it's pretty good.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
67963,Corliss Estates 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This winery gives its wines extra years in bottle prior to release, and it pays off with powerful, muscular, densely structured that have been polished to a fine luster. This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa. It shows tremendous depth, and it could be cellared for another few years—but why wait?",55.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
68039,Sheldon 2007 Deviant Velocity Petite Sirah (Lodi),"A complex, dark-cherry-flavored Petite Sirah, this is marked by bright fruit and tame tannins, giving the wine a mouthwatering vibrancy. Intense but full of life, bottle aging has helped this wine, as it often does with a variety like Petite Sirah, which can be overwhelming when young. In this case, the years have opened it up, lending an elegance that makes the wine ideal for meaty foods.",28.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
68047,Adamant Cellars 2007 Bliss White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a juicy, fruity white blend, with more than a hint of honeyed sweetness. Ripe fruit captures flavors of peach flesh and skin, along with tropical suggestions of guava and papaya. In short, this is not your typical, grassy, herbaceous style of Sauv Blanc/Sémillon. I'd serve it as an aperitif, well-chilled.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
68053,Provenance Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Forward and savory, with crisp acidity giving a balancing bite to the green apple, pineapple, honey, fig, smoky vanilla and peppery spice flavors. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
68089,Beaulieu Vineyard 2007 Reserve Tapestry Red (Napa Valley),"Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this is a rich, softly tannic and delicious wine. It brims with jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and sweet cedar flavors, in a sweetly chewy texture that hints at further ageability. Drink now–2015.",50.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
68352,Millésimé 2007 Scoprire Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Firm tannins and ripe-to-overripe fruit marks this dry young wine. The blackberry, raisin, dark chocolate and anise flavors are strong. It's a Rhône-style blend, based on Syrah and containing Cabernet Sauvignon.",45.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
68440,Murrieta's Well 2007 Zarzuela Red (Livermore Valley),"A well-made blend of Spanish and Portuguese red varietals, with the majority Tempranillo, with bright red cherry and cranberry and high acidic tones that's also got a touch of lovely minerality, olive, toffee and vanilla. The 2007 is ready to drink now, a well-balanced easy drinker with great aromatics and not too much tannin.",29.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
68463,Villa Mt. Eden 2007 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Amador-Napa),"A bit too soft and sweet for Zinfandel, but it sure is delicious in berry fruit, chocolate, pepper and herb flavors. Drink now with barbecue.",12.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
68503,Velocity 2007 Red Wine Red (Rogue Valley),"With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending. But for those who want to glimpse the future of Malbec in southern Oregon, this is a touch point. Delicate, balanced, herbal, mixing a wash of light fruits with nuances of herb, this very drinkable wine has appealing delicacy and verve.",24.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
68899,Spann Vineyards 2007 Betsy's Backacher Bottle Blond Semillon-Chardonnay (Yorkville Highlands),"This is an interesting wine that shows the creamy pineapple and vanilla flavors of Chardonnay, yet with rich, more exotic notes of cashew nuts, yellow apricots and marzipan. It's full-bodied and almost sweet, yet complex enough for a fine dinner.",17.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
68909,Ironstone 2007 Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Lusty and ripe, this big, exuberant Zinfandel brims with black currant, red cherry, plum, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's an easy wine to drink, but also shows some real complexity.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
68910,Sineann 2007 Red Table Wine Red (Oregon),"Plump and loaded with sweet and tangy red and purple fruits, this lush table wine mixes flavors of raspberry, black cherry and plum hard candy with bracing acids. The juicy, forward fruit gives it a Beaujolais-like quality; nothing too substantial here, but quite delicious.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
68996,Summers 2007 Estate Villa Andriana Vineyard Charbono (Napa Valley),"Charbono is a variety that used to be more widely planted. It's always a rustic wine, but it ages forever, and can develop sweet complexities. In its youth, it's fruity, soft and tannic, with ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
69287,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Syrah-Cabernet Franc Red (Finger Lakes),"Aromas of tomato leaf and blackberry unfold into flavors of pepper and cherry cola. Vanilla aromas dominate the long, crisp finish, which shows nicely refined tannins.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
69292,Standing Stone 2007 Vidal Ice Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),"A beguiling nose of honey and lemon leads on this lovely ice wine from Seneca Lake. Lush and mouthfilling, the wine's sweet, floral character is balanced by a crisp acidity and delicious spice. Elegant but expressive.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
69470,Doyenne 2007 Métier White White (Red Mountain),"The latest Métier is 100% Viognier, all from Ciel du Cheval on Red Mountain. The lack of Roussanne in the blend takes away some subtle level of complexity, and this wine, though ripe and extracted and quite seductive, seems a bit one-dimensional. It's a really, really good dimension however, with lush peachy fruit and generous dollops of vanilla cracker and toast.",34.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
69489,Bonair 2007 Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The alcohol is under 11%, and there is a sweet, honeyed peach flavor underlying tart green apple fruit. It's like biting into an apple tart, with the same mix of fruit, cinnamon, honey caramel, and fresh-baked crust. A substantial 6.6% residual sugar.",13.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
69639,Page Mill Winery 2007 Tazetta Vineyard Syrah (Livermore Valley),"Dark purple red with a great fruity nose full of blackberry, tart cherry and dark plum, this tiny-production out of Livermore Valley is medium bodied with deep concentration and a nice finish cradled in cardamom and earthy bacon.",24.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
69884,Chaddsford 2007 Rosé Chambourcin (Pennsylvania),"A subtle nose of strawberry and honey, followed by elegant but cheerful fruit flavors, makes this a fun everyday rosé. Acidity and a clean finish give it food-friendly panache. Not complex, but easy to like.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
69890,Sylvester 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Semisweet and likeable for its crisp, clean mouthfeel, this wine has candied flavors of grapefruit juice and lemonade. Nice with curried fare or as a summertime sipper with fried chicken.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
69963,Jefferson Vineyards 2007 Meritage (Monticello),"Charred turmeric and cumin notes spice up this Bordeaux-style blend's core of dark cherry and mocha aromas. It's robed with tame acids and finessed tannins, finishing with a tangy sanguine-like note.",40.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
70049,Penguin Bay 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"The Finger Lakes has some excellent micro-climates for Gewürztraminer and Penguin Bay's 2007 is the proof. The nose is lovely, with intense notes of exotic Asian spices. The palate, while not particularly concentrated, is exquisitely balanced, leading to a fresh impression on the finish. This bottle just screams for some good Chinese food.",17.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
70120,Rutherford Grove 2007 Pestoni Family Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Crisp, bright and clean in lemony flavors, with notes of green grass, honey, vanilla and thyme. A zesty wine for goat cheese, figs and fresh fruit.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
70121,Schulz 2007 Samuel's Cuveé Red (Napa Valley),"Brawny, bone dry and peppery, a big, full-bodied blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that needs decanting or aging to make it drinkable. Hard tannins overwhelm the blackberries, mulberries and cedar. Try late 2010.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
70182,Yorba 2007 Shake Ridge Vineyards Tempranillo (Amador County),"Yorba's Tempranillo is very masculine, briary and tannic, packed with earthy baked plum, raspberry and dark chocolate mocha, with a slight trace of black licorice. Concentrated and lush, it would stand its own against many a big slab of meat.",38.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
70183,Yorba 2007 Shake Ridge Vineyards Zinfandel (Amador County),"Yorba is doing the world of Zin lovers a huge favor by holding its wines in bottle for longer than most producers, and what you get for all that waiting is a wine ready to drink that's still got plenty of structure and ageability. This Zin shows great depth, with subdued fruit and darker flavors of plum and coffee allowed to shine, rounded out by an intensity of spice.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
70229,Girard 2007 Artistry Red (Napa Valley),"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",40.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
70231,Viansa 2007 Vittoria Pinot Grigio (Sonoma Valley),"Lush and luscious, this Pinot Grigio brims with rich flavors of pineapples, wildflowers and tangy orange zest, with highlights of dusty spices and spearmint. It has the weight of a Chardonnay.",55.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
70561,Pacific Rim 2007 Wallula Vineyard Biodynamic Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic, one of just a handful in Washington to achieve that recognition. It's all natural, ripe and full-flavored, with a wonderful, mouthfilling intensity. The flavors are a lovely mix of stone, yeast, flower and a jumble of citrus and apple fruits.",32.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
70597,Cana 2007 Red (Contra Costa County),"Tough and gritty but dry, with overripe flavors of raisins and pepper.",29.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
70598,Cana 2007 Ryland Malbec (Contra Costa County),"Tough in tannins and soft in acids, this Malbec has a syrupy texture. The flavors of blackberries and currants have a raisiny, Porty edge.",24.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
70604,Ortman Family 2007 Cuvée Eddy Red (San Luis Obispo County),"This Rhône blend is a disappointment. It smells minty and green, and tastes sharp and harsh, with unripe flavors that veer into red currants.",24.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
70607,Bloomer Creek 2007 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"This wine starts with a spicy nose of black cherry, pepper, and a touch of green pepper. The palate offers lean and spicy flavors of green pepper, herbs and cherry. The wine is a touch angular, but paired with a richer dish, will balance out.",24.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
70610,Brutocao 2007 Feliz Vineyard Dolcetto (Mendocino),"Soft in the mouth, but quite tannic, this Dolcetto has flavors of cherries. The alcohol is nice and low, but the wine tastes a little sweet, like melted jam.",18.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
70611,Peirano 2007 The Other White (Lodi),"Overtly sweet, like a sugary donut with pineapple cream and vanilla filling. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier.",12.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
70781,Cabot Vineyards 2007 Merlot (Humboldt County),"This is a confounding wine in many ways, one that could have easily scored higher, or scored lower. It starts with an almost alarming taste of vanilla and cherry coke and a slight bite of alcohol, but over time, got much more interesting. Finally, it turned earthy with pleasant hits of olive and caramel competing for dominance.",22.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
71134,Doyenne 2007 Aix Red (Red Mountain),"This is locked up tight upon opening; plan on giving it a good couple of hours in the decanter. Peppery and firm, the compact berry, cherry and plum fruit shows a touch of leather in the nose. The addition of Cabernet seems to mute the brightness of the Syrah.",34.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
71152,Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
71160,Cadaretta 2007 Highclimber Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A one-of-a-kind 100% Sangiovese from Cadaretta, this pure and expressive wine shows concentrated strawberry fruit presented in a balanced style with acids and tannins in perfect proportion. There is no hint of new oak, just a softening from barrel aging, and a lovely presentation of the pretty young fruit.",50.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
71265,Villa Mari 2007 Row 7 Red Red (Old Mission Peninsula),"This is a medium-bodied wine with notes of dried rose, spiced pastry dough and sour cherry. It finishes short and dry, with faint flavors overlaying the firm, tannic framework.",50.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
71307,Walter Dacon 2007 Sangiovese (Red Mountain),"Winemaker Lloyd Anderson is consistent and stylish in his winemaking, and his wines show well across the board. This captures the house style—extracted, dark, fruity and full-bodied, with the higher acidity and precision sculpturing of the Sangiovese grape. Lovely spice adds more highlights to the finish.",31.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
71446,Star Angel by Montes 2007 Aurelio's Selection Red (Paso Robles),"A Rhône-style blend that's rich in cola, blackberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The tannins are fine and ripe, while acidity is on the soft side, giving the wine a certain directness. Yet it's nicely dry and clean. Drink now.",60.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
71627,Ingleside 2007 Merlot (Virginia),"Surprisingly, in the blind lineup, Ingleside's regular bottling of Merlot fared slightly better than its Reserve bottling of the same vintage. Overall, this is a supple wine, with flavors of chocolate-covered cherry and clove as well as a note of pear drop that cuts through the core.",18.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
71756,Three Rivers 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 23% Sauvignon Blanc, an unusual choice in light of the sweetness (3.1% residual sugar) of the finished wine. It's hard to tell what the winemaker was thinking here, but the result is a bit diffuse, both sugary and lightly lemony without coming together harmoniously.",19.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
71757,Venge 2007 Bianco Spettro White (Napa Valley),"Fruity and a little one-dimensional, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier has citrus, apple, floral, spice and honey flavors that are balanced with good acidity.",26.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
71836,Dashe Cellars 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A first-rate Zin that shows the variety's briary power, unleashing a tidal wave of wild forest berry, plum, licorice, leather, chocolate and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Lip-smackingly good.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
72006,Trios 2007 Red (Sonoma Valley),"A rich, complex, spicy wine whose raspberry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors are forward and flamboyant. It's a little sweet, and probably at its best now, but flashy.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
72009,Raymond 2007 R Collection Lot No 3 Merlot (California),"Good for the price. It's rich and oaky, with lots of jammy fruit, cassis, vanilla, toast and spice flavors. With production of more than 14,000 cases, it's easy to find.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
72216,Doyenne 2007 Roussanne (Red Mountain),"Roussanne, with barely seven years history in Washington, is making good headway, thanks to efforts such as this. It seems to capture the floral and citrus complexity of the best Viogniers, while adding in richer layers of fruit through a pleasingly honeyed middle. Lively and lingering, it has the balance and depth to improve in bottle over the next four or five years.",34.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
72225,Wine Guerrilla 2007 Forchini Vineyards Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This seriously good Zin shows off its ancient vineyard's terroir as well as Dry Creek's amenability for Zinfandel. Rich and complex, the wine is very spicy, flooding the mouth with creamy flavors of grilled red cherries, red currants, Fig Newton cookies, mocha and even a hint of sweet, char-broiled beefsteak. Now through 2012.",30.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
72230,Ardenvoir 2007 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As one might expect, this is Washington rosé with a French touch, courtesy of consulting winemaker Christian LeSommer. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc, given a four-hour soak and then fermented in neutral oak, it is exceptional in every way. Silky and flavorful with a mix of peach and strawberry, vanilla cookie and amazing length.",16.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
72326,Leonesse Cellars 2007 Signature Selection Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.",70.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
72602,Abacela 2007 Viognier (Southern Oregon),"Stainless-steel fermentation and picking the grapes at a relatively low brix (24.2) yields a crisp wine with lime skin, grapefruit and hints of quinine. The opening flavors extend into a mid-palate cut with tart acids and adding white peach, melon and nectarine to the fruit. It finishes bone dry, like a twist of lemon.",21.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
72603,Apolloni 2007 Pinot Grigio (Willamette Valley),"Apolloni seems to be the first Oregon winery to take advantage of a change in the state's labeling laws allowing Pinot Grigio to be used; previously Pinot Gris was required. This is in fact much like a classic Italian Pinot Grigio, crisp and acidic, with sharply-defined citrus, melon and green apple fruit. Clean and refreshing, it carries a lovely floral note through the persistent finish.",17.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
72695,Petroni 2007 Estate Grown Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Too sweet and soft, like a confection in a glass. Tastes like a raspberry and cherry tart, spiced with cinnamon and dusted with cocoa, and turns hot and Porty-like on the finish.",40.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
72808,Domaine Alfred 2007 Chamisal Vineyards Pinot Gris (Edna Valley),"What a great Pinot Gris. Barrel-fermented, it shows a toasty, creamy smokiness to the citrus, nectarine, fig and vanilla flavors, with that Edna Valley acidity that's so clean and refreshing. Absolutely delicious, it's rich and substantial enough to stand in as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.",24.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
72911,Cadaretta 2007 sbs Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It's about 75% Sauv Blanc, 25% Sémillon. Lush with bright, fresh flavors of pineapple and grapefruit, it also has good acids with nuances of tangerine, orange and lemon peel. It's refreshing and textural, the sort of white wine that demands shellfish and seafood. Especially good on the finish, which adds a bit of cinnamon.",22.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73226,Otis Kenyon 2007 Carmenère (Horse Heaven Hills),"This almost pure Carmenère (there is a little Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend also) sneaks up on you. At first herbal and green, it fills in with a few hours of breathing time, lengthens and shows unsuspected complexity. Cranberry, a whiff of smoke, a bite of pepper, and fresh, not dried herbs, nicely blended into a seamless, satisfying whole.",36.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73229,Ravenswood 2007 Teldeschi Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and rugged in tannins, this Zin displays a complex array of wild berry, tobacco, cocoa and dusty Asian spice flavors. It's a little heavy in liqueur-type softness. Calls for barbecue, grilled beef, or even dark chocolate.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73230,Sapolil Cellars 2007 Patina Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The Patina vineyard has some of the oldest Syrah plantings in the Walla Walla valley, and this designate is a fine effort. The dry-farmed grapes yield mixed flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and cherry, with hints of tobacco leaf. Licorice streaks through the finish, which lingers with excellent concentration.",35.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73304,Marimar Estate 2007 Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempranillo (Russian River Valley),"This is a good wine, dry and balanced, with a rich tannic structure. It's also very strongly flavored. The fruit detonates in the mouth, offering a flood of blackberries, black cherries, black raspberries and currants, with complex notes of unsweetened baker's chocolate and peppery Provençal herbs and lavender. May calm down with a few years in the bottle.",45.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73308,Columbia Crest 2007 H3 Les Chevaux Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Les Chevaux blends 48% Merlot, 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, yielding a wine that is smooth, supple, and complete. It has both roundness and depth, and a lovely melding of cherry, chocolate and tobacco.",15.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73310,Old Ghost 2007 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Very high in alcohol but wears it well, showing a soft, lush texture and lots of fruit flavors.

73313,Saintsbury 2007 Sawi Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Saintsbury brings a Pinot Noir-like touch to this Syrah. It's silky and transparent, with an elegant mouthfeel, but shows Syrah's weight and depth, with blackberry, blueberry, leather and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
73352,Buty 2007 Columbia Rediviva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"From the winery's Phinny Hill vineyard, the Columbia Rediviva is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 52% Syrah. Complex and satiny, it's a riveting wine, inky and bursting with a sensuous mix of berry, cassis, mocha, loam, cinnamon and spice. Tremendous density and depth; despite its youth the wine curls around the tongue like thick smoke, showing more and more detail.",48.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
73366,Tulpen 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Once again the Merlot is the best of a very fine flight of Tulpen wines. More muscular than the Cabernet, it includes 10% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot in the mix, resulting in a dense, dark wine loaded with black fruits. Polished tannins are lightly layered in streaks of leaf, herb and earth. The alcohol tops 15%, but there is not a hint of heat in the finish.",28.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
73838,The Federalist 2007 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A very fruity Zinfandel, rewarding in blackberry, blueberry tart and currant flavors, accented with dark chocolate, anise and pepper. Too soft, and would benefit from greater crispness, but it's a nice Zin now.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
73846,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Merlot (Paso Robles),"Good, deeply extracted flavors in this darkly soft wine, with blackberries, plums and spicy, chocolaty chai tea. It's nicely dry. The tannins are a little off, with some ragged, green edges that won't age away, so drink now.",24.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
73878,Yates Family Vineyard 2007 Alden Perry Reserve Red (Mount Veeder),"Impressive from start to the very long finish, and even better than the splendid '06. Rich and full-bodied, this Bordeaux blend is marked by soft, sweet tannins and concentrated, oak-infused flavors of blackberries, black currants and chocolate, with complexing notes of olives and smoked meats. Should develop for up to a decade.",55.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
73882,Swanson 2007 Merlot (Oakville),"One of the best Merlots of the vintage, at a good price for the quality. Shows a structural quality and ripeness that are pure Oakville, with ultra-refined tannins, good acidity and plush, complex flavors of black cherries, red currants and licorice that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. New oak comprises 40% of the barrels, and adds beautiful notes of toast and warmth.",36.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
74056,Zerba Cellars 2007 Wild Z Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Zerba's crowd-pleasing Wild Z blends Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah about equally, with a splash of Cabernet Franc to finish it off. It's a ripe, full, forward, chocolaty mouthful. It keeps the red fruit tart and tantalizing, while loading in the barrel flavors (French and American) to round off the finish. A fine follow-up to the excellent 2006.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
74059,Perry Creek 2007 Zinman Zinfandel (El Dorado),"A lovely Zinfandel, soft and dry, with luscious cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors, dusted with pepper and cocoa. Easy to drink and versatile with everything from pizza to a grilled steak.",14.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
74118,Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",140.0,97,1,0.9791730291902131
74244,Cottonwood Winery of Oregon 2007 Raya Jade Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Sourced from the Crawford vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley, this inexpensive Syrah seems a bit stripped. There is some good material here, but a whiff of volatility and a deadness in the mouth robs it of vitality. Light cherry and plum, with a dash of coffee, is what's left.",15.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74670,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2007 Keuka Lec Reserve Gently Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Pretty orange blossom and yellow peach aromas against a backdrop of petrol make this “gently dry,” light-bodied Riesling a classic expression of the grape. Lots of ripe stonefruit and florals shower the palate, leading to a persistent finish marked with vibrant acidity and a bright lime skin finish.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
74687,Bell 2007 Talianna Red (Napa Valley),"Here's a soft, fruity and sweet Cabernet, rich and spicy in raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. Lots of new oak adds smoky vanilla and caramel notes. It's delicious, but pretty direct, lacking some complexity and structure.",70.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
74768,Coeur d'Alene 2007 Syrah (Washington),"It's a fine effort, with classic Washington Syrah character. Berry, funk, mushroom, and spicy herb dominate, with plenty of juicy acidity and the structure to unwind as it cellars. Still tight and tannic, this is a wine to decant or, better yet, wait a few years before opening.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
74775,Anthony Road 2007 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Definitely sweet, but with enough fresh acidity to carry the intense, apricot-infused palate and finish up with lingering notes of quince, lime and peach. Perfect for Pad Thai.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
74937,Muscardini 2007 Pauli Ranch Sangiovese (Mendocino County),"A good, somewhat common wine that displays lots of rich fruit, but also the fundamental weaknesses that Sangiovese displays in California. The wine is dry and medium-bodied, with cherry, black raspberry, coffee and leather flavors. But it's a bit sharp in acidity and rugged in the mouth.",42.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
74939,Chaddsford 2007 Merlot (Pennsylvania),"A good honest Merlot, with vanilla, spice cake and woodsy scents followed by cherry pie flavors and a medium finish of ash and green pepper. This is a subtle and restrained wine that should appeal to fans of Bordeaux. Drink now.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74943,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast),"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74949,Hard Row To Hoe 2007 Shameless Hussy Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Barbera is very pruney in the nose, with scents of smoked meat under the fruit. Despite the suggestion that the grapes got a little baked, there is plenty of acid, perhaps an indication that this varietal is difficult to get right in Washington State vineyards. Drink this one soon.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74952,Chaddsford 2007 Syrah (Pennsylvania),"There's ample varietal typicity here, with black and white pepper and meat notes on top of layers of green herbs, and licorice. Structurally, however, the wine has a few sharp elbows, with dry tannins and a disjointed oak note. All this is topped off by a pleasant, Fernet Branca-spiked finish. Drink now.",19.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74954,Snake River 2007 Arena Valley Vineyard Grenache,"Really charming, with sweetish brambly fruit and smooth plum nuances. Fairly concentrated, with a juicy, date and cranberry finish. Try with barbecue. Drink now to 2011.",19.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74956,Three Fox 2007 Il Signor Reserve Sangiovese (Virginia),"All cherry and sawdust upfront, backed up by a bed of velvety tannins. Vanilla and char notes dominate the palate while some berry-intense flavor comes through on the crisp finish. A year in the cellar would allow for some needed integration.",29.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
74957,Vin du Lac 2007 Barrel Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sweet, grapey, raspberry fruit is smothered in sweet spices, with flavors of spun sugar candy.",28.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

75135,Minassian-Young 2007 GMSV Red (Paso Robles),"A basic red Rhône blend, with a dash of Viognier for acidic brightness. Shows simple, thin flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a dash of sweet oak.",22.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75141,Robert Pepi 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"Bone dry and nicely crisp, and the price is right, but the wine itself has some problems. The fruits tend toward lean, tart grapefruits, lemons and limes, with a touch of vegetable.",11.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75143,Glen Ellen 2007 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Weedy and vegetal despite some decent raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Okay for a big party where nobody's fussy.",10.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131

75148,Thacher 2007 Controlled Chaos Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and slightly sweet, this wine tastes like raspberry and cherry syrup with a dash of melted milk chocolate. It's also hot, with 15.7% of alcohol. Zinfandel, Mourvèdre and Grenache.",33.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75149,Thacher 2007 Triumverate Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Good berry, cherry, chocolate, tobacco and spice flavors in this Zinfandel, but it's too soft and flat in structure. It's also frankly hot, with 15.7% alcohol, and has a Porty finish.",36.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75150,Minassian-Young 2007 Grenache (Paso Robles),"A simple wine, with cola, herb and raspberry tea flavors that are dry, but have a sharp mouthfeel. Seems unevenly ripened, with awkward tannins.",22.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75151,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Tart in acidity, with simple cherry flavors that taste baked into a pie. But the finish is fully dry. Tannic, too, with the result that the mouthfeel is hard as nails.",24.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75154,Buttonwood Farm 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Not a bad wine, but green and minty-sweet, like a raspberry sour candy lozenge. The grapes and tannins just didn't get ripe enough.",22.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75157,Minassian-Young 2007 Black St. Peter Red (Paso Robles),"Soft and melted in fruit, with high alcohol that gives it a burn, this Zinfandel and Mourvèdre-based blend has raspberry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now with spicy burgers, ribs, roast pork.",23.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
75260,Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Malbec (Santa Barbara County),"Very dry and tannic, a somewhat austere wine. But it has a deep core of blackberries and black currants along with a meatiness, like charred beef off the grill. Interesting and complex, for slow sipping with complex beef, pork and lamb dishes.",30.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
75270,Clos du Val 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.",26.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
75279,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Roundly fruity, loaded with bright berries, and nicely spiced with herbal (tobacco) highlights.  Immediately approachable and nicely structured, this open and generous effort glides into a smooth and chocolaty finish.

75280,Tempus Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
75281,Three Rivers 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 90% Malbec and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon; it's dark, toasty, smoky, earthy and dappled with ground coffee flavors. The fruit holds its own—it's tight and tart and firm, with plenty of blackberry flavor. This wine keeps resonating through the palate into a solid, textural finish.",29.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
75305,Sherwood House Vineyards 2007 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Smoke and dark chocolate notes abound on this elegant Long Island Merlot (made with 10% Petit Verdot).

75825,Ca' del Solo 2007 Ca' del Solo Vineyard Muscat (Monterey County),"This is just the kind of white wine California needs more of. It's crisp in acidity, with a brilliant, unoaky focus of fruit. Best of all, the alcohol is a low 12.5%. There may be some residual sugar, but the tangerine flavors are so crisp, the wine feels dry. What a great sommelier wine.",17.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131

76314,Mazzocco 2007 West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady.",32.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
76316,Wilson 2007 Diane's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A big, soft, ultrarich style of Zinfandel. It has very high alcohol, with flamboyant flavors of milk chocolate, oozingly ripe blackberries and blueberries, anise liqueur and black pepper. The finish is totally dry. Lusty and heady.",60.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
76430,Zaca Mesa 2007 Black Bear Block Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from 100% Syrah, this wine shows Zaca Mesa's house style of exceptionally ripe, heady fruit flavors tucked into a balanced, dry wine. It's as lush as velvet in the mouth, with complex flavors of blackberries, anise, cocoa and black pepper. Feels soft and light and yet powerful and insistent at the same time. Drink now–2013.",60.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
76434,Terlato 2007 Pinot Grigio (Russian River Valley),"Break out the hors d'oeuvres for this tart young Pinot Grigio. It needs food to balance it out. The acid-backed flavors are savory, and include Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass and sweet butter. Try with delicious little fish and pork appetizers baked in phyllo.",26.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
76448,Lost Canyon 2007 Alegria Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"A good, complex, full-bodied Syrah, with some toughness in the texture and a minty note that's less than ripe. Bigtime tannins and extreme dryness call for well-marbled beef to coax out its best.",38.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
76765,Occidental Road Cellars 2007 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"This Syrah was grown and produced by the winery owners, and held back almost five years before release. That's an impressive act of courage, but it has benefited the consumer. The wine, while still somewhat tannic, feels mellow, with a complex array of black fruits and berries, grilled bacon, sweet tobacco, dark chocolate and, above all, freshly crushed black pepper. An impressive Syrah that should change in interesting ways over the next six years.",38.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
76889,:Nota Bene 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"Lovely delineation here, the berry/cherry fruit framed with coffee and chocolate from a 50/50 mix of French and American oak barrels. The surprise is the addition (via co-fermentation) of 6% Viognier, which stabilizes color and gives a pleasing, floral/citrus lift to the scents and flavors. Good balance and follow through.",35.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
76892,William Church 2007 Sur La Mer Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Bordeaux blend of five grapes, this melds blackberry and black cherry fruit with plenty of toasty oak and ground coffee. It's a nice mix of fruit and barrel, dark and smoky, but not too heavy at 14.2% alcohol.",28.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
76893,Beresan 2007 The Buzz Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"There should be plenty of buzz about The Buzz. Dense and dark, loaded with black fruits, coffee grounds and ground pepper, this high-alcohol, slightly volatile wine is not unlike some cult wines selling for four times the price.",19.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
76894,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Canoe Ridge Estate Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"A fine effort in this classic vintage, the Merlot is firm, almost muscular, and dappled with fresh herbs—cilantro and basil. The brambly blackberry fruit has the power to more than hold its own after 18 months in two-thirds new French oak.",22.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
76928,Dusted Valley 2007 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Grenache is not an easy grape to ripen in Washington, but this is just about perfect—juicy with fresh berry and rhubarb fruit, and added notes of marjoram, rosemary and cracked pepper. Full-bodied and pushing close to 15% alcohol, this is fine pizza wine.",28.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
76939,Damiani 2007 Barrel Select Merlot (Finger Lakes),"The inky purple color announces the very serious intention of this robust, fruit-focused Merlot. Liquor-like intensity and gripping tannins command your attention while mocha, vanilla, cassis and raspberry flavors keep your palate entertained. The plum-infused finish is long and flavorful. Better after 2010.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
77179,Arcadian 2007 Stolpman Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is a current release from Joe Davis, who holds his wines back until their prime. Hailing from Ballard Canyon, it shows black plum, pressed purple flowers, tanned leather and balsamic notes on the nose. There's a pleasantly yet softly structured texture to the palate, where dried blackberry, roast beef, lilac and Concord grape flavors arise.",45.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131

77287,Fritz 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Pretty thin, with very high acidity and just a trace of lemon, grapefruit and pepper flavors. The dryness and tartness are really clean and bracing, but if you're looking for richness, this will disappoint.",18.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
77297,Perbacco Cellars 2007 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"A little on the sweet side, with Lifesaver candy lemon, lime and pineapple flavors, this unoaked PG is clean and balanced with crisp acidity.",14.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
77400,Wilson 2007 Ellie's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Few wines are as ripe and fruity as this. It's explosive in raspberry jam and cherry pie flavors, with scads of dusty pie spices, and the smooth tannins make it silky in the mouth. The problem is excessive sweetness. If you like a sugary, glyceriney edge to your red wines, it's for you.",35.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
77487,Mount Baker 2007 Barrel Select Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This “Barrel Select” Syrah has been ripened to pruneyness, yet remains short, hot and simple. It could be any red grape left to hang late and fermented at (perhaps) high temperatures.",14.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
77719,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Merlot (Paso Robles),"Good, deeply extracted flavors in this darkly soft wine, with blackberries, plums and spicy, chocolaty chai tea. It's nicely dry. The tannins are a little off, with some ragged, green edges that won't age away, so drink now.",24.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
77726,Amalie Robert 2007 Syrah (Willamette Valley),"This is cool-climate fruit, from a vintage the winery describes as “the coolest year we have ever seen.” Nonetheless they have made a good wine, with balanced scents and flavors. It's definitely herbal, but also brings some cured meat and tart, wild cherry flavors into play.",35.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
77734,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2007 DeMayo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
77868,Geyser Peak 2007 Block Colection Russian River Ranches Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A really nice, versatile white wine to have with everything from salad Nicoise to roast chicken and pork enchiladas. Crisply acidic and bone dry, it shows tasty lemon and lime flavors, lots of pepper and a hint of gooseberry.",20.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
78017,Castello di Borghese 2007 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"While soft on entry with slightly pulpy, sweet plum flavors, this Cab Franc gains intensity on the midpalate as spicy bramble notes and soft tannins accumulate. Approachable in style, it's a pleasant everyday red with just a hint of leafy green on the finish.",25.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
78099,Jalama 2007 Giallo White (Santa Barbara County),"Made from Pinot Gris, this dry white wine tastes too oaky in buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel. It finishes with raw acidity.",20.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
78101,Clayhouse 2007 Adobe Red Red (Central Coast),"A rugged wine, with harsh tannins and a green, unripe taste to the cherry-berry flavors.",15.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
78110,Cinnabar 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Ultraripe, simple and almost as sweet as jelly, with flavors of cherries, raspberries and vanilla. The alcohol is 15.9%.",21.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
78143,Terlato 2007 Episode Red (Napa Valley),"This is Terlato's ambitious entry into the cult Cabernet lottery. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it's an elaborate wine, deep and long in blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are impressive, yet young, giving a tough, astringent mouthfeel. But ageability is brought into question by some superripeness, in the form of raisins.",175.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
78206,Clos du Val 2007 Three Graces Blend Red (Napa Valley),"Clos du Val has always made wines with long-term cellaring in mind. This blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is dry and tannic, with spicy, toasty oak dominating. Beneath that are rich, compelling notes of cassis and dark chocolate. The alcohol is refeshingly low, below 14%. This dramatic wine needs a minimum of six years, and should develop for at least ten.",65.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
78464,Caraccioli 2007 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This sparkling wine, a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, is dry, creamy and rich in flavors of citrus, yeast and vanilla. It feels refined and silky on the palate, with a honeyed finish.",52.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
78678,Jacob Franklin 2007 #50 Mon Chou Red (Napa Valley),"Marked by enormously ripe, powerful fruit flavors, this wine explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries and red plums. Oak adds even richer notes of toast and sweet caramel. Drink this deliciously soft wine now.",55.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
78708,Veritas 2007 Doug & Mary Wolf Special Edition Reserve Cabernet Franc (Monticello),"This special edition release is perfect for those drinkers who enjoy the herbal and savory side of aged Cab Franc. Dried tobacco, jalapeño and red currant reduction start on the nose and carry to the medium-bodied palate. Streaks of graphite offer a bit of life to a wine that should be enjoyed soon. With its sandy tannins and still lively acid, enjoy alongside a lamb shank.",35.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
78969,Kiona 2007 Reserve Estate Dry White Riesling (Red Mountain),"Spritzy, with light stone fruit flavors suggesting peach and pear. Hints of residual sugar, some good texture in the mouth, and a lactic, slightly buttery finish.",13.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
79065,Ehret 2007 Syrah (Knights Valley),"Quite a good Syrah, although it's a little too soft, so open it now because it won't hold for too long. It's dry and silky smooth in the mouth, with rich, ripe blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
79067,Zerba Cellars 2007 Wild Z Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Zerba's crowd-pleasing Wild Z blends Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah about equally, with a splash of Cabernet Franc to finish it off. It's a ripe, full, forward, chocolaty mouthful. It keeps the red fruit tart and tantalizing, while loading in the barrel flavors (French and American) to round off the finish. A fine follow-up to the excellent 2006.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
79068,Abacela 2007 Malbec (Umpqua Valley),"Exotic scents immediately characterize this wine as fascinating; weaving together incense, smoke, wild berry, baking spices and plum jam. Yet the wine retains a delicacy, lightness, its flavors based upon juicy acids rather than new oak. It showcases the fruit, and does so with grace and panache.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
79167,O•S Winery 2007 Champoux Vineyard Riesling (Horse Heaven Hills),"Intense, spicy and loaded with grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, this has a unique intensity and power. If you distill Washington Riesling down to its essential fruit/sugar/acid components, this expresses it beautifully. At just 9.8% alcohol, it's a definite Kabinett style, with so much acid that the 2% sugar does not signify.",22.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
79277,Terra d'Oro 2007 Home Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"A little too sweet, with a candied taste of sugared cherries, blackberries and cola, and a dash of caramel. Other than that the tannins are very fine.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
79278,Terra d'Oro 2007 Sangiovese (Amador County),"A tough, gritty wine not offering much richness. It's very dry and quite acidic, and the modest cherry flavors veer into tobacco, white pepper and sage.",18.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
79281,Harmony Cellars 2007 Diamond Reserve Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"There are some tough, astringent tannins in this wine that make it harsh on the palate and bitter on the finish. The actual flavors are of cola, raisins and black currants. Doesn't seem like an ager.",37.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
79506,Concannon 2007 Nina's Cuvee Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"From one of Livermore's oldest producers, a small-production Petite Sirah, one of their specialties, all from an estate vineyard planted 40 years ago, this wine is super dark purple in color, very earthy, with nice chocolate and delicate fruit interspersed among the dusty tannins. Pretty and interesting.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
79516,Macari 2007 Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),"Strawberry cream on the nose and a subtle touch of lemon blended in with strawberry flavors gives this rosé a pretty balance of sweet and crisp. Fun, but with substance, it could be paired with everything from a light seafood salad to a heartier poultry dish.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
79540,Ironstone 2007 Obsession Symphony (California),"Ironstone's track record for this pretty dessert wine continues with the '07. It's off-dry, with residual sugar just under 2%, and polished flavors of pineapples, oranges, marzipan, honey and vanilla. High acidity adds the perfect touch of crispness.",8.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
79572,Starry Night 2007 The Caboose Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Heavy in alcohol and overripe, but entirely dry, and the black currant, chocolate and pepper flavors will play well against richly sauced barbecue.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
79584,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Refreshing, lively, this Pinot Gris starts with aromas of grapefruit and lemon and leads into zesty flavors of white pepper, lemon and grapefruit. A touch acidic, the wine could use more fruit balance, but overall an enjoyable dry white choice.",17.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
79625,Chaddsford 2007 Portfolio Collection Due Rossi Barbera-Sangiovese Red (Pennsylvania),"Fresh and appealing, this unusual blend of 80% Barbera and 20% Sangiovese really works. It's crisp and delicate, with obvious vanilla and mocha notes from 10 months aging in oak barrels and a medium, very berry finish. Try with grilled meat.",25.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
79848,Kokomo 2007 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A lovely Zinfandel, soft and delicious. It has very ripe flavors of red cherries, red currants, raspberries, cocoa, anise and peppery spices, wrapped into rich, finely ground tannins. Drink now.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
79852,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2007 Artz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),"A compelling mix, with bright, vivacious fruit flavors running from apple to pear, peach to papaya. The influence of barrels is felt more than tasted, but it does add a whisper of toast to the finish. Lively and fresh, this is a great wine for richer seafood.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
79857,Bergevin Lane 2007 Calico White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An excellent version of this wine, mixing together 39% Chardonnay, 31% Roussanne and 30% Viognier. It was half stainless and half barrel fermented, combined to deliver crisp, racy flavors of lemon cucumber, pineapple, citrus rind and a hint of pepper. Overall this is a very bright and nicely defined wine.",16.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
79910,Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect. But the fruit is there in support—black cherries and blackberries—and the hint of toast and mocha in the finish provides exactly the right send-off into the next sip.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
79982,Elyse 2007 Korte Ranch Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"From old, head-trained vines near St. Helena comes this dense, intense young wine. It's all Napa in the claret-like structure that's built upon firm, refined tannins. Shows waves of blackberries, black  currants, dark chocolate and peppery spices.",37.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
79989,Hahn 2007 SLH Estate Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A dark, rich, ripe Syrah that defines the California style, and preserves the fine structure that this cool-climate region lends to red wines. The wine is dry and tannic, and the flavors, of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, are just delicious. Now and for a few years.",27.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
80016,Shooting Star 2007 Aligoté (Washington),"This unique wine, made in California by Jed Steele, is sourced from Washington's only planting of Aligoté. Bright and spicy, it's anchored with solid apple/pear fruit flavors and zippy acidity.",13.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
80023,Abacela 2007 Merlot (Southern Oregon),"A mix of estate-grown and sourced (from the Rogue valley) grapes, this Oregon Merlot has black cherry and chocolate at its core, but quickly thins out, with very tart acidity. It's got its own style, with stiff tannins, the leaf and stem notes subdued, and a fine balance. But it will show best with food, especially steak.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
80027,Castello di Amorosa 2007 La Castellana Red (Napa Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese is much drier, more acidic and earthier than many other Napa reds. Therein lies its strengh and its weakness. It's a firm wine with suggestions of cherries and tobacco that will satisfy folks who complain about fruit bombs. But it's also pretty tart. Drink now with rich Italian-inspired fare.",65.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
80040,Trinchero 2007 Central Park West Vineyard Petite Verdot (St. Helena),"The underlying wine is thin in fruit, so what stars is oak, with its toasty, caramelized aromas and flavors. It's also fiercely tannic. You'll find some briary blackberries and blueberries, but the wine illustrates why Petit Verdot is best used as a blender.",50.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
80051,Elsom Cellars 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Peppery and bright, this carries tart flavors of wild berries and mountain herbs. The penetrating peppery character is its most defining attribute.",36.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
80067,August Ridge 2007 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"High alcohol marks this wine, giving it a burn, especially after you swallow. Other than that, it's soft in acids and tannins, with cherry and currant flavors. At nearly six years old, it's giving its best now.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
80120,Titus 2007 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices. The tannins are rich and strong. Will age for a long time, gradually losing density and becoming softer and sweeter.",27.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
80253,Barlow 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A decent Merlot that shows berry and cola fruit flavors, with a touch of oak and beautiful tannins. It's a little hot and funky. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",35.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
80456,Basel Cellars 2007 The Earth Series - Volume 1 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The flavors are herbal, the tannins a little green, but no rough edges have been left. Could be a good burger bottle.",22.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
80471,Patit Creek Cellars 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It's a rustic, slightly raisiny Bordeaux blend (with a little Syrah also), sourced from excellent vineyards, but a bit overripe. Soft, forward and a little leathery, it's ready to drink up.",16.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
80686,Navarro 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino),"Sometimes a Sauvignon Blanc this dry, acidic and low in alcohol can be unbalanced, but this one hits it out of the park. With tastes of citrus zest, white peach, green apple and spice, it's just a beautiful apèritif wine, and also is ideal supporting roast chicken, bruschetta with chèvre, and grilled veggies.",17.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
80693,Spindrift Cellars 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This excellent Pinot Gris brings crisp, enticing flavors that perfectly mix pear skin, citrus and spice with a finish that somehow evokes coffee grounds and caramel. Huh? Don't know how that happens, but what a riot of flavor in such a simple wine. Better yet, the alcohol rests at an unbelievable 12.5%—unheard of in the last two decades. Tart and juicy, this is as European as it gets in Oregon.",14.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
80724,Powers 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Solid and varietal, this puts the fruit up front, a substantial, mouthfilling plum and black cherry combo. Streaks of licorice, coffee, chocolate and smoke can be found, though exposure was minimal and the barrels were used. Well done, quite clean and a fine value.",14.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
80728,Damiani 2007 Meritage (Finger Lakes),"True to the ambitious Damiani style, this wine has tightly packed fruit tones with a generous overlay of vanilla and mocha from toasty new oak. Intoxicating flavors of caramelized pineapple and boysenberry frame the dense palate while refined tannins provide a counterbalance to the dense fruit. The finish is moderately long and slightly drying, winding up with a chocolate note. Best 2011–2013.",27.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
80732,Hard Row To Hoe 2007 Shameless Hussy Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Riverbend vineyard—the estate vineyard for Fielding Hills—is the fruit source. Also in the blend are Cabernet Sauvignon (12%) and Cabernet Franc (10%). Berries, cassis, coffee liqueur, vanilla and coconut flavors combine in a tasty and substantial take on Merlot. This is especially rich in barrel flavors for this price.",20.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
80743,Bella 2007 Two Patch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.",38.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
80751,Gifford Hirlinger 2007 Stateline Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Dark, plush, well-ripened fruit is the focus of a wine still a bit stiff and steely. It's classic in the way a Bordeaux is classic, firm and confidently blended.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
80863,Pomum 2007 Shya Red Red (Yakima Valley),"A five-grape Bordeaux blend, with somewhat generic fruit flavors that show a mix of leaf and raisin characteristics. It's smooth and supple, drinking at its best right now, with finishing highlights of peppery herb.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
80866,Baer 2007 Arctos Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Arctos is more Cab-centric than its sibling Ursa, but in 2007 it must take second place. The blend is about two thirds Cab Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes also represented. It has scents and flavors of fruit that seems just on the verge of spoilage—both leafy and fat, and there is a bitterness to the finish that overtakes the ripe, raisiny berry fruit.",41.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
81083,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An interesting, fecund nose carries aromas of wet hay along with cherries and plums. Well-balanced and high-toned flavors are bright and set the fruit against firm tannins and a layer of loam and graphite.

81085,Guglielmo 2007 Private Reserve Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Santa Clara Valley),"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925. With lots of bittersweet chocolate, white pepper and well-integrated oak, this Petite is subtle, its alcohol relatively low and its tannins quite refined, a Petite for French palates.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131

81321,Easton 2007 Old Vine Zinfandel (Fiddletown),"The texture stands out on this dry, balanced wine. It's all velvet and silk in the mouth, almost like Pinot Noir, but everything else screams Zinfandel. The flavors are wild and exuberant, of innumerable wild berries, pepper, licorice and sweet, smoky bacon. Should develop over the next four years.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
81466,Roederer Estate 2007 Brut L'Ermitage Estate Bottled Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity.

81496,Poet's Leap 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Loaded with honeysuckle, melon, pear, peach and hints of sweet grapefruit, this juicy wine perfectly captures the intensity of Washington Riesling and the complexity of German wines. Buoyant and precise, with notes of chalk and limestone in the finish, this is a stunning achievement in a challenging vintage.",20.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
81515,Fielding Hills 2007 RiverBend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"The Fielding Hills Syrah remains one of my favorites in a state loaded with great Syrahs, fruit-powered with spicy purple fruits, annotated with scents of game, anise, smoke and moist earth. The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus.",40.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
81517,Gorman 2007 The Evil Twin Syrah-Cabernet (Red Mountain),"Extremely dark, inky, black, impenetrable; dense in every way, this highly extracted wine is a real tongue-stainer. The fruit is blueberry compote; the tannins grippy and strong, but polished and ripe; the acids and minerality keep the power under a firm leash.",60.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
81522,Olson Ogden 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. But it's also fairly tannic. Very fine now, with a brief decant, and through 2013.",52.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131

Best now.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
81607,Apolloni 2007 Conti di Val Seriana Soleggio Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is an Oregon winery's take on a super Tuscan red. Aromas are volatile and those high tones carry into the flavors. Light raspberry fruit, high acidity, and a sharp astringency characterize the wine.",27.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
81612,Christian Lazo 2007 Barbera (Paso Robles),"Dry, acidic and tannic, in the way of a young Barbera. Shows flavors of baked cherries, red currants, anise and tobacco, with a long, spicy finish. Will live on for many years without outgrowing its rusticity.",25.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131

81903,Toulouse 2007 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Very pale in color, this '07 Gewurz, tasted just 6 months after harvest, was a bit muted. Airing brings out rich, spicy aromas and flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to dates, vanilla, wildflowers and dusty spices. The wine was barrel-fermented.",22.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
82259,Ventana 2007 Gewürztraminer (Arroyo Seco),"There's no oak on this crisp, young wine, so all you taste is the pure fruit. It's a little sweet, with residual sugar of 1.9% that gives it a honeyed edge, but the acidity is quite high and balancing. Flavorwise, it's all about wildflowers, pears, passionfruit, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",16.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131

82392,Avery Lane 2007 Merlot (Washington),"Broad, sturdy and herbal, this everyday Merlot is a fine choice for simple grilled fare. It's actually a rather interesting blend, with a mix of Cabernet Franc, Lemberger, Syrah and Sangiovese adding to the Merlot base.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
82394,Villa San Juliette 2007 Chorum Syrah-Cabernet (Paso Robles),"Tough in tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel, although it's also soft and jammy sweet. A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this rustic wine is a little hot in alcohol. Drink now.",18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131

82897,Bouké 2007 Red Table Wine Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah blend starts with a sultry wave of juicy plum, smoke, pepper and cherry.

82899,Peachy Canyon 2007 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Spicy and dry, this Zin offers flavors of currants, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. The tannins are thick, but acidity is low, giving it a soft mouthfeel. Could be more concentrated, but it's an elegant wine.",36.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
82902,Cuvaison 2007 Syrah (Carneros),"Rather heavy and super-fruity now, with fruitstand flavors of blackberries, cherries and plums. It's a ripely delicious wine, but a bit one-dimensional, not showing much elegance or subtlety. Could develop bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83021,Dalton 2007 Dalton Vineyard Marsanne-Roussanne White (Calaveras County),"An interesting, exotic wine, full-bodied and rich.

83024,Benton-Lane 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Benton Lane's reliable, stainless-steel fermented Pinot Gris does not go through malolactic fermentation.

83038,Morgan 2007 R&D; Franscioni Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Morgan's been on a roll the last couple of years, now that they've figured out how to make this wine from fruit grown in a cool part of the Highlands. Aged in older oak barrels, the wine shows no wood at all, but has a creamy softness that modifies the crisp lemon, lime, grapefruit, pear and wildflower flavors. This is one of the best Pinot Gris in California.",17.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
83321,Brian Carter Cellars 2007 Byzance Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Southern Rhône-influenced blend of 51% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre, with a splash each of Counoise and Cinsault. Slightly high-toned, bright cherry flavors, pencil lead, earth, asphalt and grippy tannins. This will need decanting in order to open it up from its tightly wound entrance.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83349,JM Cellars 2007 Tre Fanciulli Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The best blend from JM Cellars is Tre Fanciulli, here composed of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, and 14% Syrah. You'll find pleasing strawberry and Bing cherry fruit, along with claret-like structure and nicely applied cinnamon and baking spice accents. It could almost fool you into thinking you were drinking an excellent Dry Creek Zinfandel.",42.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
83779,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tart, juic, and peppery, with blackberry and boysenberry fruit. Though rather herbal and tannic, it displays good balance and moderate concentration.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83784,Ravenswood 2007 Icon Mixed Blacks Red (Sonoma County),"This is one of those old-fashioned field blends of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and who knows what else.

Drink now, with barbecue.",75.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83788,Snoqualmie 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a steely, herbal, high-acid Merlot, with pale red fruit flavors of cranberry and currant. Accents of clove and iron are wrapped into stiff, but ripe tannins. Nice structure, ready for steak.",10.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83789,Snoqualmie 2007 Naked Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Made with organically grown grapes, and harvested rather late (end of October) from vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills, this is a surprisingly substantial, earthy offering. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are laced with graphite and iron ore, and some black olive herbal character adds interest to the finish.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
83854,Heintz 2007 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",48.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
83856,PharaohMoans 2007 Westside Red (Paso Robles),"This Rhône blend from the fashionable west side of Paso Robles is made in the modern cult style. It's very dark in color, full-bodied and glyceriney in the mouth, and delivers a thermonuclear blast of fruit and oak. Among the flavors are roasted blackberries, cassis, melted milk chocolate, anise, cotton candy, vanilla custard, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice. Not exactly your classically dry table wine. Drink now.",95.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
83870,Pride Mountain 2007 Viognier (Sonoma County),"Viognier is nothing if it's not rich, and who knows richness better than Bob Foley?

83934,Duckhorn 2007 The Discussion Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),"Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s.",115.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
83958,Bargetto 2007 Gewürztraminer (Monterey County),"This is a very nice Gewürz at a fair price. It's crisp in citrusy acidity, giving a cutting edge to the slightly sweet flavors of papaya, litchi, white peach, green apple, vanilla and Asian spice.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131

84131,Columbia Crest 2007 Two Vines Vineyard 10 Red Wine Red (Washington),"The red wine companion to the excellent Two Vines Vineyard 10 White has got some stuffing, tannins and chewy, herbal flavors, but the fruit holds its own with flavors of wild plum and rhubarb.",8.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
84135,Efeste 2007 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain),"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Red Mountain Syrah remains a bit tight and tannic, with hints of green tea in the finish. The fruit is tart and compact, with a nose of blueberry and brown sugar. Tannins are quite hard and slightly bitter; this will require some further cellaring.",34.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
84144,Lang & Reed 2007 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A very rich, soft, complex wine, twice the size of L&R;'s regular 07 Cab Franc.

84293,Big Guy 2007 Big Guy Red (California),"Just shows you don't need a super high score to have a super drinkable wine with steak, pork, veal, chicken, or just a simple burger.

84490,Pheasant Valley Winery 2007 Chukar Ridge Syrah (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This is already drying out, its fruit fading and its mouthfeel turning a bit woody. There's a trace of of tart berry fruit, with plenty of drying tannins. Drink now.",21.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
84552,Campus Oaks 2007 Viognier (Mokelumne River),"Nicely dry and tart, with mouthwatering acidity. The flavors are of citrus fruits, with a vegetal undertow of green beans that is not necessarily unpleasant. Clean and vibrant, it's a good cocktail wine.",10.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
84926,Eola Hills 2007 Syrah (Oregon),"Thick and syrupy, this Syrah is not for everyone, but it will certainly stand apart from the crowd. Flavors of black cherry compote and maple syrup soak into the earthy, tannic base, with just a hint of volatility.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
84937,McCrea 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Viognier (Red Mountain),"Sharp, spicy and crisply defined with citrus fruits and skins. The skin flavors really punch through and add power to the midpalate. May have some Picpoul in the blend (to cut the alcohol?).",25.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
84942,Barnard Griffin 2007 Fumé Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An iconic wine for Barnard Griffin, this is blended with 16% Sémillon.

84959,Bunnell 2007 Talcott Vineyard Viognier (Wahluke Slope),"From a hot, sandy site in the heart of the Wahluke Slope, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. The aromas are an inviting mélange of spice, clove, lime and light tropical fruits, and the wine has natural poise and balance. Green apple, lime and peach come into play, along with streaks of butterscotch.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
85165,Hedges Family Estate 2007 Red Mountain Red Red (Red Mountain),"Formerly the popular Three Vineyards bottling, this has been re-named, but remains the same friendly Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend, with just a bit of Syrah adding spice. Smooth and silky in the mouth, it mixes red and blue fruits, with a ripe, round midpalate and light chocolate and toasted nuts to finish.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
85170,Thurston Wolfe 2007 Howling Wolfe Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills),"Thurston Wolfe pioneered Zinfandel in Washington. This is the seventh vintage from the Zephyr Ridge vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, vinified to California-style alcohol levels of 15.5%.

85173,Fortress 2007 Finale Sémillon (Red Hills Lake County),"Honeyed richness gives this wine its allure. It's fabulously sweet and unctuous, with apricot-and peach-infused flavors enriched with vanilla and crème brûlée. Could be crisper in defining acidity, but it sure is decadent.",30.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
85448,Tarara 2007 Syrah (Virginia),"Initially, sweet, feminine violet notes and juicy, ripe blueberries on the nose and palate make this seem innocent and coquettish. But full body, big, chunky tannins and a vibrant acidity against a backdrop of smoke and char make this wine a compelling pick, and potentially one that could benefit from a few years in the cellar.",50.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
85592,Balboa 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Supple and balanced, this 100% Merlot brings ripe berries and cherries  matched to moderate acids and silky tannins.

85710,Pride Mountain 2007 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"One of the best Sangiovese out there, mainly due to the ripe balance.

85719,Terre Rouge 2007 Sentinel Oak Vineyard Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"The new oak sticks out on this Syrah, with caramel, buttered toast and vanilla dominating the underlying blackberry and cherry fruit. However, the wine is young, and its intensity is obvious. Sometimes these reds don't show well in youth but develop dramatically in the bottle. Give it until 2011, and try through 2013.",40.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
85722,Pedroncelli 2007 Bushnell Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Smoky caramelized oak now dominates this wine, but the underlying flavors are very strong, and everything should come together by mid-2010.

86069,Graziano 2007 Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"A fine Mendocino Petite Sirah that's mouth filling with blueberry and licorice and plenty structured to age longer than it already has.

86282,Côte Bonneville 2007 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),"Côte Bonneville releases this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend quite late, so it's well into the maturing process. Pretty aromas of smoke, tea and mint accompany secondary fruit flavors. The vintage produced well-balanced wines, but many have slipped into a bit of a dumb phase at the moment, so try in 2015.",120.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
86614,Lakewood 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Aromas of white fruit and citrus lead, followed by semi-sweet tropical fruit and citrus flavors with a touch of acidity. Fresh-tasting and friendly, this makes for a great summer sip. Serve with Asian cuisine, grilled foods.",13.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
86893,WillaKenzie Estate 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A little dull and disappointing given this winery's excellent track record with Pinot Gris, this wine may reflect the difficult, wet 2007 vintage. It's crisp and balanced, but does not show the ripe fruit flavors of previous vintages. Tart green berries, green apple and grapefruit flavors dominate, bone dry and high acid. A slightly metallic note creeps into the finish.",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
86945,Sheldrake Point 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Beautifully perfumed with ripe pommelo, orange blossoms and a spray of fresh lemon zest. A rich, luscious mouthfeel on the palate is balanced with bright grapefruit acidity and a refreshing minerality. Finishes dry with a zesty lemon rind astringency.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
86958,Murrieta's Well 2007 Red Meritage Meritage (Livermore Valley),"A bit of a muted nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (24%), Petit Verdot (22%), Cab Franc (11%) and Malbec (1%) out of the Livermore Valley. A good balance of fruit and tannic power here, but not a ton of depth. The finish drops off a bit, too.",35.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
87046,Cycles Gladiator 2007 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),"Simple and candied, with flavors of pineapple juice and not enough acidity for balance.",10.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
87047,Grayson 2007 Merlot (California),"Simple, with blackberry, cherry, carob and herb flavors wrapped into a jagged texture.",10.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
87054,Hunter III 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Unbalanced, with citrus fruit flavors that taste distinctly sugary mixed with sharp, green mintiness.",24.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
87137,Rochioli 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Rochioli's Sauvignon Blanc declined in quality in the 2006 vintage, and 2007 continues that downward trend. It may be the chilly vintage, but this release is thin and minty, with green, gooseberry flavors that barely manage to veer into citrus fruits.",35.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
87300,Saggi 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.   Saggi is the Long Shadows collaboration with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. the blend in 2007 is 43% Sangiovese, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Syrah. With each new vintage, the percentage of Sangiovese climbs, putting more Tuscany in this new world super-Tuscan wine. Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
87302,Dusted Valley 2007 BFM Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy and precise, this is a Bordeaux mix, with sharp-edged cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit, encased in a strong, fortress-like, oak stockade. Clearly a wine to decant, it's got plenty of power and 15.3% alcohol, yet retains a supple mouthfeel and sense of proportion.",45.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
87338,Jamesport 2007 Mélange de Trois Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Subtle hints of toast, vanilla and spice add warmth to succulent black-cherry and blackberry flavors in this crowd-pleasing Bordeaux-style blend. It's boldly structured and textured on the palate, but balanced by brisk acidity and a veil of soft, finely-grained tannins.",24.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
87343,Jamesport 2007 Jubilant Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Hints of spice and leather add a savory tone to red cherry and plum flavors in this bold but elegantly structured red wine. The palate is juicy with fruit, but accented with a spray of green herbs and brisk acidity that lend freshness.",45.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
87370,PasoPort 2007 Portray Ruby California-Style Dessert Wine Port (Paso Robles),"Very sweet in honey and bubbling brown sugar, with a nice fruity core of blackberries and mocha. Could be a little more concentrated and focused, with a simple finish, but it gets the job done with admirable dessert wine hedonism.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
87464,Brian Carter Cellars 2007 Corrida Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This inaugural release of Brian Carter's “Spanish Style Blend” is 70% Stone Tree vineyard Tempranillo. Carter is a supremely skillful and thoughtful blender, and the result is a luscious, mouthwatering bottle of wine that opens with a perfect mix of berries and light chocolate; scents of spice and mint; and a palate-pleasing streak of bacon fat that lingers happily in the mouth.",35.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
87468,Envy 2007 Nord Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Shows real elegance and finesse in a variety that can sometimes get a little out of control. With smoothly polished tannins giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel, this single-vineyard wine has rich blackberry, black currant and pepper flavors. Fine now, and should develop for many years.",45.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
87562,Kunde 2007 Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"These old vines are famous for concentration, and this Zin surely is one of the most intense wines of the vintage. It's huge in wild berry, currant, licorice, dark chocolate, bacon and exotic spice flavors that go on and on. For all the richness, it's wonderfully balanced, with fine tannins and a crisp backbone of acidity. Drink now.",30.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
87566,Nobility 2007 Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Napa County-Sonoma County),"Extra-ordinarily sweet, with fantastic honey, apricot, pineapple, orange marmalade, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Could be more complex, but dazzles for sheer decadence.",75.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
88490,Lone Canary 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"100% varietal, this is impressively deep in color, yet trips lightly across the palate. It tastes of pretty strawberries, with hints of creamy chocolate.",22.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
88494,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2007 Wetzel Family Estate Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A lovely Merlot, soft and supple. Shows a fine balance of cherry fruit, herbs and sweet oak, with modest alcohol and dusty tannins. Very nice and elegant.",20.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
88577,Wesley Ashley 2007 Intelligent Design Cuvée Red (Central Coast),"Carignan, Grenache, Cinsault, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Pinot Noir make up this mongrel blend. The wine is dry and quite complex in berry, leather, cola, currant, spice and cedar flavors, although it's very soft. Not going anywhere, so drink now.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
88586,Fidelitas 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure varietal, with ripe fruit hinting at an encroaching pruney flavor, this is wrapped in the big flavors of barrel toast, smoke and coffee. Quite consistent with the overall style of winemaker Charlie Hoppes, this is one of those wines that will engender heated discussions between admirers and critics.",35.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
88661,Fortino 2007 Charbono (Santa Clara Valley),"A grippy, ink-staining, concentrated Charbono from the Santa Clara Valley, made from 90% estate-grown Charbono (the vineyard is in San Martin) and 10% Syrah. Two years spent in French oak might explain its minty, cedar highlights, rounded out by black cherry and plum.",34.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
88675,Brazin 2007 Sommer Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Big in berry and currant fruit, high in alcohol, hard in astringent tannins. Brazen indeed. But you know what? This Zin pulls off its balancing act. It's a spicy, briary, lusty wine that will pair well with slow-cooked, braised meat dishes, like lamb shanks.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
89009,Coturri Winery 2007 Testa Vineyards Charbono (Mendocino County),"Sonoma County's Coturri, an early advocate of organic farming and old-fashioned winemaking, has made a tiny amount of Charbono, a hybrid of Nebbiolo and Grenache. Grown at Testa in Mendocino, a great source of many heritage varieties, including Zinfandel and Carignane, this Charbono is grapey and rustic with a fair amount of acidity throughout.",30.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
89020,Suncé Vineyard & Winery 2007 Meritage Quintessential Meritage (North Coast),"This blend of all five Bordeaux varieties has cranberry, plum, sage and herb throughout and is good, with a medium-body and tart finish. Aged almost two years in nearly all new French oak it's fairly light on its feet. Much of the blend (27%) is Alexander Valley Cabernet, the Merlot is from Sonoma Valley and the Cab Franc from Dry Creek. The Malbec and Petit Verdot, earthy and leathery both, come from Clear Lake.",48.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
89047,Curtis 2007 Ambassador's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A simple but satisfying Syrah, sweet and jammy in raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit flavors, with lots of black pepper. Earns extra points for good tannins and balancing acidity.",22.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
89058,Lullaby 2007 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bottled in a lovely 500 ml bottle, with a label of cut paper with butterflies, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. It's a beautiful color, a coppery salmon, much like rosé de Provence (where winemaker Virginie Bourgue is from). It's dry and fruity, but more complex than most newly released rosés, with light berry fruits, a lovely texture, and a finish that suggests malted milk chocolate candy.",16.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
89059,Mannina Cellars 2007 Seven Hills Vineyard Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Mannina gets some nice accolades for its Sangiovese, and is planting its new vineyard with several different Italian varieties. This new release shows Chianti-like structure, color and texture. It's ripened to pretty strawberry fruit flavors, with suggestions of tobacco leaf and plenty of acid. Neutral barrels were used, allowing the fruit to remain in focus.",22.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
89178,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2007 Artz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),"A compelling mix, with bright, vivacious fruit flavors running from apple to pear, peach to papaya. The influence of barrels is felt more than tasted, but it does add a whisper of toast to the finish. Lively and fresh, this is a great wine for richer seafood.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
89219,:Nota Bene 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Much more accessible than the winery's 2006 Syrah, this mixes muscle and meat, highlights from smaller component parts (Mourvèdre and Grenache) and overall clever blending. While bringing in the tart red fruit, the composted leaves, the moist loam and light funk of Washington Syrah, it also shows some pretty baking spices and a tight, precise finish.",25.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
89257,Streamside 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Dry and crisp, with gooseberry and lemongrass flavors accompanied by tart, citrusy acidity. Stops just short of annoying feline pyrazines. Nice with goat cheese.",17.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
89268,Righteous 2007 Red Wine Red (Wahluke Slope),"Righteous is a new budget label for Sweet Valley Winery. Mostly Merlot, this smooth, fruity red wine is ready to drink. It tastes like a latter-day version of the Hearty Burgundies of old, only with better fruit, and a hint of hazelnut in the finish.",12.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
89281,Trione 2007 River Road Ranch Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Here's a flashy Syrah for drinking now. It does what California does so well, showing rich, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit, chocolate and white pepper flavors, generously oaked, and housed in ripely soft, complex tannins.",32.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
89301,Robert Hall 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication.",15.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
89305,Ca' del Solo 2007 Ca' del Solo Vineyard Albariño (Monterey County),"A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.",20.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
89428,Brutocao 2007 Feliz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino),"Quite a fine Sauvignon Blanc, racy and delicately structured but rich, with mineral-laden citrus and lemongrass flavors. The acidity is the best part, tart and mouth-watering. This is Brutocao's best Sauvignon Blanc ever.",14.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
89441,Esterlina 2007 Riesling (Cole Ranch),"This is Esterlina's off-dry Riesling, and it's as good in its semi-sweet way as a dry bottling. Shows the same brilliant acidity and delicious citrus, peach, wildflower and vanilla flavors, with a complex, honeyed richness.",19.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
89479,Peju 2007 Persephone Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Wonderful flavors in this dry Syrah, ranging from blackberries and cherries through cola to dried herbs and anise. The tannins are gentle. The big problem is excessive softness, which mars the wine's structural integrity. Ready now.",32.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
89522,Minassian-Young 2007 Bailey Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, a wine with tastes of chocolate-covered cherries, raspberries and smoky sandalwood. Drink now.",23.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
89523,Ricardus Corculum 2007 ClandestZin Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Super-fruity and ultra-soft, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, bacon, cocoa, cola and lots of peppery spices. It's a nice Zin to drink with BBQ.",40.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
89526,Imagine Moore 2007 Love Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Apple and cinnamon aromas on the nose provide a warm welcome while the clove-flavored palate comes alive via mouthwatering acidity. While the finish is short, this wine shows much promise. Try with Thai dishes.",15.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
89531,Alchemy Wine Productions 2007 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"Fruity and ripe, almost overripe, with jammy, grilled cherry pie filling and red licorice flavors and a Porty sweetness. Drink now.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
89537,Pepperwood Grove 2007 Zinfandel (California),"A sound, useful Zin, good for casual purposes, at an everyday price. Dry and velvety, it shows flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha, leather, anise and pepper.",7.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
89747,Bray 2007 Verdelho (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This Portuguese variety, most often spelled “Verdejo,” isn't widely planted in California. But here, from Bray's estate vineyard, it has produced a lovely wine. Crisp and fine, with flavors of honeysuckle, lemongrass, peaches and candied ginger, it's the perfect accompaniment to Vietnamese or Burmese food.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
89947,Kimmel 2007 Merlot (Mendocino),"A terrific red wine. Stood out in a blind tasting among expensive Napa Valley Bordeaux-style reds. The grapes are from the winery's high-elevation ranch in Potter Valley. The wine shows firm tannins and a brisk backbone of acidity, with the cherry, red plum and currant flavors grounded with fresh herbs, mushrooms, grilled meat and a smack of tamari that suggests Chinese mushu pork. Really a dramatic wine that should hold over the next four years.",38.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
89953,Grand Rêve 2007 Collaboration Series II Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Ross Mickel (Ross Andrew Winery) made this Côtes du Rhône-style blend, a flashy riot of floral scents and earthy, funky fruit. Even with several hours breathing time it feels tight—decanting is mandatory. But give it a few years in the cellar and it will unpack even more layers of flavor. Dry and astringent in the mouth, it brings young flavors of cranberry juice and grape concentrate, plenty of acidity and minerality, and excellent depth.",45.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
89958,Jarvis 2007 Petite Verdot (Napa Valley),"Loads of plum, dark chocolate, blackberry and exotic spices in this big, dry wine. Oak, too, in the form of exquisite vanilla and caramel. It's absolutely delicious, but maybe a little one-dimensional, showing that Petit Verdot by itself needs some help from other varieties.",80.0,91,1,0.9791730291902131
90023,Treleaven 2007 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),Lime and slate notes make for a very nice opening but lead to a distractingly high level of spritz. The crisp palate is lacking in flavor and finishes on the watery side. Drink up.,15.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
90025,Montelle 2007 Chambourcin (Missouri),"The gorgeously opaque ruby color raises high hopes. However, the undistinguished, earthy nose fails to deliver. The lush palate is a step up, with red berry soup flavors interwoven with an odd ashy note. Long finish. Drink up.",10.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
90029,Castel Grisch 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Instantly appealing aromas of rose water and kiwi fruit make for a great opener but yield to a one-dimensional palate. The short, slightly flabby finish shows pleasant orange rind notes.",16.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
90034,Rooster Hill 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Orange rind and Chinese spices make for an intriguing opener but the palate falls flat, with little to offer but a few simple lemon and lime flavors. Short finish.",16.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
90038,Castel Grisch 2007 Chancellor (Finger Lakes),"Crisp and exceptionally low in tannin, the Chancellor grape is perhaps this continent's answer to the Gamay of Beaujolais. The brilliant garnet hue of this example will force you to pick up the glass. Unfotunately, what you find there won't hold your attention for very long. The aromas are pleasant but diffuse and lead to a one-dimensional palate with only a few faint notes of red fruits.",12.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
90078,Chandon 2007 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville),"Rich and smooth, this has complex flavors of raspberry, almond biscotti, lime and vanilla, with a smoky note. The texture shows real finesse. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's a first class bubbly.",45.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
90121,Clos du Bois 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"Acidity marks this mouth watering wine. It's crisp and tart, providing balance to the slightly sweet flavors of pineapple and apricot jam. Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this popular style.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
90122,Cosentino 2007 Pinot Grigio (Solano County),"An easy white wine that shows brisk acidity supporting well-ripened fruit flavors that are a little sweet. Pears, citrus fruits, green apples, figs, vanilla and white peppers flood the mouth, wrapped into a creamy, honeyed richness.",20.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
90180,Proulx 2007 Black Label Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A first-rate, delicious Zinfandel that shows Paso at its best. It offers a flood of blackberries and cherries that have a roasted edge, along with notes of cocoa, cassis, toasted almond, cinnamon and pepper. Very good now and for a few years.",33.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
90237,Carica 2007 Kick Ranch Syrah (Sonoma County),"The winery has a good track record with Sauvignon Blancs from this vineyard. Now, they've produced a very good Syrah. It's a big, thick, Aussie Shiraz-style wine, with firm tannins housing flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha, sweet oak and black pepper. Dramatic and delicious.",30.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
90238,Columbia Crest 2007 H3 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"There is plenty of color and extract in this tannic wine. Blackberry fruit is at the core, and though aged in one third new oak, it is not evident in the flavors. A balanced and beautifully proportioned wine, which accurately captures the AVA's strengths.",15.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
90554,JM Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Purple-black, with rich scents of bright boysenberry fruit, and an unusual earthy umami note that adds depth to the finish. Sharp, young, acidic and grapy, this drinks like a younger wine.",32.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
90557,Pirouette 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Supple and inviting, from the nose of flowers and dark fruits, to the chocolatey tannins that lick the back of the throat, this is a fully-realized, smooth and most accessible red wine.",55.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
90566,Darby 2007 The Dark Side Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Syrah is a core strength of Darby, and as with previous vintages, this is dense and aromatic, leading from floral scents into a dark, almost broodingly deep core of blackberries, cassis and pepper. Full-bodied and 14.4% alcohol, this captures the essential strengths of Washington Syrah, done as a fruit-driven, berry-laden style.",25.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
90661,Loredona 2007 Viognier (Lodi),"This is bottled in one of those tall, thin Alsace-type bottles, and while it's technically a dry table wine, it could almost be a dessert wine. There's a sugary edge to the peach, pineapple, honey and wildflower flavors. With crisp acidity, the wine is basically off-dry.",12.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
90666,Wellington 2007 Estate Vineyard Marsanne (Sonoma Valley),"A little too sweet for a dry table wine, with sugary flavors of tropical citrus fruits, coconut macaroon and vanilla sponge cake. Almost a dessert wine, but clean and vibrant on the finish, and quite delicious.",22.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
90978,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",64.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
90980,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",53.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
90981,Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",20.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
90986,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",53.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
90989,Buty 2007 Rediviva of the Stones Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",55.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
90995,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",46.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
90999,àMaurice 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scents of cinnamon, peppery herbs and Asian spices. Lovely, detailed and deep, this blends sharply etched red and purple fruits with seams of vanilla and cut tobacco. Flavors follow, with medium acidity and leafy tannins. Nicely balanced, spiced, varietal and persistent.",35.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
91002,J. Bookwalter 2007 Protagonist Red (Red Mountain),"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits. There are subtle suggestions of mint and some alcoholic heat, and an interesting orange peel scent carries into the mouth. The tannins are big and ripe and not at all bitter or too heavy.",50.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
91006,Quilceda Creek 2007 Palengat Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",85.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
91007,Seven Hills 2007 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Once again, here is a Seven Hills wine that opens with truly lovely aromatics. It's a clean varietal expression of Syrah, with medium weight, wild berries and finishing highlights of pepper, earth, sea salt, baking spices and cassis.",22.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
91100,Headbanger 2007 Rock n Red Red (Sonoma County),"An upscale hamburger wine, fruity and spicy. There's a bacony, smoked meat note to the raspberries and cherries that will play well against the char of grilled beef.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
91194,Clovis Point 2007 Archeology Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This has a pronounced nose, with aromas of black fruits swathed in savory dried herbs, mushrooms, game and smoke. The palate, by contrast, is juicy with tart black-cherry and berry flavors framed with ripe, but grippy, tannins. Pleasant now, but it could improve over the next 3–5 years.",60.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
91242,Gainey 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made with 15% Cabernet Franc, which adds a welcome cherry tart richness to the earthy blackberries and herbs, this Merlot is priced well for an elegant restaurant wine. It's dry and crisp and smooth, and so easy to drink with a fine steak.",19.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
91252,Olsen Estates 2007 Rouge des Coteaux Red (Yakima Valley),"An interesting Rhône blend (40% Grenache, 26% Cinsault, 23% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre) sappy and bright, with a generous mix of berries. Still tasting quite young and tight, this may benefit from additional cellar time.",18.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
91369,Airfield Estates 2007 Spitfire Dolcetto-Primitivo-Sangiovese Red (Yakima Valley),"Airfield reds are thoroughly saturated with color, and often quite tannic, to the detriment of the lighter, more subtle fruit. This wine loses its definition and turns from pretty to pretty harsh as a result.",24.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
91372,Hey Mambo 2007 Sultry Red Red (California),"Soft and fruity, with jammy flavors of cherries and currants edged with peppery spices. A nice, simple table wine based on Syrah and Barbera.",13.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
91391,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Jemrose Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Fruity enough, with powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, currant, chocolate and licorice flavors that go on and on through the long, spicy finish. Could show greater structure, though, as it's somewhat soft, sweet and unidimensional.",30.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
92584,Venteux 2007 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Too much unripeness in this wine, which shows aromas of asparagus and broccoli. Tastes somewhat better than it smells, with blackberry and black cherry notes.",46.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
92592,Mount Baker 2007 Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),"Sugary, with a chemical aroma and a sharp, volatile finish.",21.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
92597,Curtis 2007 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A difficult wine to like. It's not quite ripe, giving a vegetal edge to the modest cherry flavors, and is cuttingly sharp in acids.",25.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131

92642,Dynasty Cellars 2007 DC3 Meritage (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A chocolaty, fragrant wine —74% Merlot, 15% Cab Franc, 6% Malbec, 5% Petit Verdot—with interesting spice highlights throughout the nose and mouth. The fruit is a mix of Bing cherry and strawberry, washed in a lush barrel-induced mix of chocolate, mocha, espresso and clove. Finishes a little hot, with alcohol listed at 14.6%.",24.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
92727,Stonehedge 2007 Terroir Select Grenache (Mendocino County),"A delicious Grenache sourced from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Vineyards, a high-elevation, cool-climate site with a peppery opening note that extends itself through dense chewy tannins and the bright fruitiness and inviting aromatics we all love about Grenache. A very nice bottle of wine with great backbone and depth that should age another 5–10 years.",26.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
92736,Riverhaven 2007 Riverrock Vineyards Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Excellent varietal character, along with the lightly funky aromas associated with the vineyard's location in the Rocks (a sub-section of the Walla Walla Valley AVA), elevate this first release from Riverhaven Cellars. Along with blackberry fruit come cinnamon, mocha, coffee grounds and clean earth, well integrated into a rich and textural wine with good length and body.",28.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
92740,Domaine Carneros 2007 Brut Sparkling (Carneros),"This is a glamorous, fashionable wine that gives the pleasure you want in a bubbly.

93333,Lava Cap 2007 Merlot (El Dorado),"Simple and jammy, with sharp flavors of raspberries, cherries, gingersnap cookies and spices. Tasty and sweet, but lacking the structure to contain all that richness.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
93334,San Simeon 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Irregular tannins and acidity give this wine a harsh mouthfeel. On the plus side, it's fresh in berry fruit, even though it's more than four years of age. Drink up.",25.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
93840,Morse 2007 Jones Vineyard Syrah (El Dorado County),"This is a tight, monstrous Syrah, with a pocket of black fruit flavor and a dollop of earthiness. It veers into raisiny territory on the finish.",24.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
93955,Lionheart 2007 Saralee's Vineyard The Angel's Share Marsanne-Roussanne White (Russian River Valley),"A distinctive wine. The first impression is of acidic dryness, which stimulates the palate. Then the flavors kick in, and they're opulent in peaches, pineapples, golden apricots, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla custard and cinnamon.",33.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
94409,Clos du Bois 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"Acidity marks this mouth watering wine. It's crisp and tart, providing balance to the slightly sweet flavors of pineapple and apricot jam. Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this popular style.",12.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
94410,Cosentino 2007 Pinot Grigio (Solano County),"An easy white wine that shows brisk acidity supporting well-ripened fruit flavors that are a little sweet.

94425,Kiamie 2007 White Kuvée White (Paso Robles),"A successful blend of Roussanne and Viognier that impresses for its complex swirl of fruits and spices, and maintains a clean, healthy balance. The peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors are enlivened with very crisp acidity that makes the wine finish clean and savory.",24.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
94705,Krupp Brothers 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"The wine tastes and feels important. It has great weight and depth. The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet. And then there's the fruit, a detonation of blackberries, cherries, blueberries and cassis, not to mention the oak, which seems as fine as oak gets. This superb wine seems like an obvious cellar candidate. It should ride out the decade effortlessly.",70.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
94715,Tulpen 2007 Coalesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, yet deftly weaves in smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Fruit-driven and complex, it's a smooth ride through fresh fruit flavors of plum, blueberry and cherry, focusing into a finish with ripe, polished tannins.",26.0,92,1,0.9791730291902131
94922,Cooper Vineyards 2007 Norton (Virginia),"There are just enough plush, woody tannins here to balance the intense boysenberry fruit.

94927,Vivác Winery 2007 Tempranillo (New Mexico),"All vanilla and mocha on the nose followed by pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit on the palate. Smooth, short-to-medium finish with just a touch of spice. Try with grilled lamb.",20.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
94928,Spann Vineyards 2007 Chardonnay-Viognier (North Coast),"Ultraripe in pineapple, tropical fruit and oaky vanilla flavors, this white blend is almost as sweet as a dessert wine. It's fortunately balance with mouthwatering acidity.",22.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
94938,Sweet Valley 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Some wines can hit 15.4% alcohol, as this does, and make it work. But here the burn and scorch from the alcohol simply overwhelms some excellent fruit. Detail is lost, and what's left is a hot, jammy red.",25.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
94960,Benessere 2007 Hollystone-Collins Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Soft and candy sweet, with raspberry and cherry pie filling, raisin, vanilla, cocoa, brown sugar and cinnamon spice flavors. The tannins are lovely and the mouthfeel is bright. If you like your Zins on the sweet side, it's for you.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
94991,Wagner 2007 Meritage (Finger Lakes),"An impressive effort, with reticent black currant and cassis tones upfront followed by pomegranate in the mouth. There's good depth of flavor here though the marked acidity and broad tannins require pairing with hearty fare. Better after 2010.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
94992,Kirkland Signature 2007 Grandmère Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),"A bit overripe and hot in alcohol. That's the price of getting such rich fruit flavors. Dark chocolate, blackberry preserves, red currants, black raspberries and spicy satsuma flood the mouth, leading to a super-spicy finish.",12.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
94994,Lucas Vineyards 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah (Finger Lakes),The Lucas 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah shows the potential the Syrah grape has in upstate New York. Dense raspberry and strawberry fruit vie with aromas of barbecued meat on the nose while a thick layer of vanilla cushions the fine tannins and smokey notes in the mouth. The juicy finish throws up an enticing licorice note. Nicely done. Drink now to 2011.,25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
94999,Sobon Estate 2007 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Amador County),"Give this young, fruity wine a few years in the cellar. The flavors are all primary blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam. The tannins and a touch of espresso bitterness might easily help this Zin develop through 2012.",17.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95000,Stephen & Walker 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a robust, ripe and fruity Zinfandel that impresses for the sheer exuberance of its flavors. They range from black cherries and red currants to cola, chocolate, black pepper and the sweet, glyceriney taste of high alcohol.",39.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95001,Swedish Hill 2007 Optiumus Red (Finger Lakes),"Plum and cherry notes struggle to show themselves under a heavy layer of coconut and sawdust from new American oak. This wine is tightly wound and dense in the mouth, with refreshing acidity and a medium-to-long finish. A year or two in the cellar will allow for better integration.",23.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95002,Hogue 2007 Genesis Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Meritage wines must be Bordeaux blends; otherwise, they can be all over the map. This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Black cherry and olive, smoke and some noticeable alcohol (14.4% is credited) define a sturdy red in wide distribution.",16.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95004,Messina Hof 2007 Double Barrel Cabernet Franc (Texas),"Serious and solid, this Cab Franc delivers the goods with a complex nose of vanilla, coconut and orange clove pomanders layered over coffee and bittersweet chocolate. There's nice fruit in the mouth, with plum and blackberry shot through with notes of cinnamon. Medium, oaky finish. Serve with roast beef. Best 2011–2012.",14.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95005,Bella 2007 Barrel 32 Lily Hill Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.",48.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95011,Fritz 2007 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Very peppery and briary, with a slightly green, minty edge to the riper wild berries and tobacco. A good, gutsy Zinfandel of character and a sense of place.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95177,Olson Ogden 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. But it's also fairly tannic. Very fine now, with a brief decant, and through 2013.",52.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
95178,Olson Ogden 2007 Unti Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is the biggest, most tannic and closed of the winery's three new 2007 Syrahs, and also the one most likely to improve in the cellar. It's intense and concentrated in pure blackberry and black cherry fruit, with the pepper, bacon, earth and smoky oak notes you want in a good 100% Syrah. But then, there are those big tannins. Give it a good 4–6 years.",38.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
95183,Think Tank 2007 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A gorgeous Syrah, sumptuous and seductive, with a texture of sheer silk and satin. Beyond that, the flavors are rich and complex, offering satisfying waves of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, cassis, milk chocolate, anise, pepper and toast. Really fine, with a good backbone of tannins. Now–2011.",45.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
95185,Vina Robles 2007 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A tremendous Petite Sirah, among the finest from Paso Robles. It's a big wine, with massive flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, mocha and smoky oak, with an ultralong, spicy finish. Yet the wine is totally dry, with refined, silky tannins. Yes, the alcohol's high, but it's completely balanced. Best now and through the next decade.",26.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
95225,Muscardini 2007 Gracie Creek Vineyards Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now.",38.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95261,Thirteen Appellations 2007 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Very dark in color, dense and thick in the mouth, and tight in astringent tannins. Clearly an immature wine not showing well. The blackberry and cherry flavors are impressive, but the wine seems disjointed. Cellaring is a gamble.",80.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
95338,Corley 2007 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Makes for nice drinking right now, because of the abundance of forward, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit. On the other hand, the tannins are considerable, and the acidity is evident, so it could age over the next six years.",55.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131
95342,Bolen 2007 Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"Delicious in flavor, with fresh, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak overlay adds richer layers of sweet caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. A crisp spine of citrusy acidity adds brightness. An appealing Merlot for drinking now.",60.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
95420,Tarara 2007 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"Pretty black cherry, char and menthol aromas gently perfume Tarara's Cab Franc. On the palate, soft black fruit flavors are not deeply concentrated, but ripe with firm grape and wood tannins for balance. Bright acidity carries through on a tart, sour cherry finish.",30.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95425,Coquelicot 2007 Mon Amour Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Bordeaux blend is a little rough around the edges. It has a sharp, jammy feeling, and seems too sweet in raspberry- and cherry-pie filling. Will appeal to fans of an easy drinking, accessible style of a Cabernet-based wine.",59.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95432,Perception 2007 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Starts with a funky smell that doesn't go away despite lots of airing. Underneath that is a very dry, very tannic and deeply flavored Zinfandel, rich in berries, cola and spices. That barnyardy smell is troubling.",53.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95493,Riverbend 2007 Estate Bottled Syrah (Humboldt County),This older vintage Syrah still has some fruit but otherwise shows drying tannins and leathery smoke.,18.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95518,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Nolan Vineyards Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure.",27.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
95529,Casa Nuestra 2007 Home Vineyard Dry Rosado Rosé (Napa Valley),"St. Helena is the source of this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Entirely unoaked, it's a dry, crisp, rustic wine, and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy flavors of cherry pie filling.",23.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
95750,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2007 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc shows all the charms of the 2007 vintage. It's an opulent, delicious wine, immediately likeable now for its broad array of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, cassis and new oak flavors.

96404,Novelty Hill 2007 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has a little bit of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) and Merlot (2%), winemaker Mike Januik say it's there “to beef up the structure.” The Sangiovese brings the acid, and tart fruits with a hint of leaf and tomato. Still young vines, but showing great promise.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
96409,Autonom 2007 Red (California),"Rich, soft and fruity, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend is delightful to drink now. It's totally dry, with interesting berry, cherry, smoked meat, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that are deep and long-lasting.",28.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131

96424,Novelty Hill 2007 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is another outstanding Sauvignon Blanc from Novelty Hill—ripe and juicy, showing citrus, mango and pear, laced with cinnamon highlights.

96550,Keenan 2007 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"Just delicious, an important, elegant Merlot to drink with the finest steaks and chops. Even better than the fine 2006, with vast, deep flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cocoa, grilled meat and herbs, wrapped into rich, smooth tannins. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink over the next six years.",60.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
96591,Kunde 2007 Viognier (Sonoma Valley),"Kunde's been on a consistent roll for years in crafting rich, balanced Viogniers. Their 2007 is crisp and ripe, offering a blast of tropical fruit, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors that finish impressively long.

96603,Bergevin Lane 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lemon oil and candle wax add interesting nuances to the citrusy, barrel-fermented fruit. There was no malolactic fermentation; it's bone dry and the acids are all natural and smooth. Delicate hints of toast and honeyed almonds bring still more depth and flavor interest to the juicy citrusfruit.",25.0,90,1,0.9791730291902131

97149,Barboursville Vineyards 2007 Malvaxia Passito White (Virginia),"To make this luscious wine, Muscat Ottonel and the hybrid Vidal Blanc are air dried on open racks, causing the grapes to raisin, concentrating their sugars. The result is a decadent wine with expressive aromas of apricot purée, tea and baking spice, plus a drizzle of caramel. It feels opulent and weighty, with a wash of zesty acidity and a zing of tangerine on the finish.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131

97705,Snoqualmie 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Snoqualmie can legitimately lay claim to being Washington's most consistent and reliable producer of mass market, value-priced wines. This tart and racy Syrah is a fine example of the quality—no frills, but no fudging either. It tastes like fruit—blueberries and boysenberries, with some leafy, herbal tannins. In perfect balance, it's a fine every day wine with more flavor interest than most ten buck merlots and cabs.",10.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
97996,Renwood 2007 Red Label Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Low in price, high in quantity, low in quality. Dry and tannic with an off taste, the wine doesn't get better with time.",12.0,80,1,0.9791730291902131
98009,Bien Nacido 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"From the vineyard's choicest blocks. There's so much going on here, it's hard to know where to begin. Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins. Extraordinarily good now, and should develop in interesting ways. Certainly one of the best California Syrahs of the last few vintages.",52.0,96,1,0.9791730291902131
98191,Hovey 2007 Dalton Cuvée Petite Sirah Syrah (Calaveras County),"Sugary sweet, this blend has jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a sprinkling of chocolate.",20.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
98192,Stefania 2007 Haut Tubee Red (California),Here's an everyday wine to drink with burgers and such. Tastes like an inexpensive wine served in a fast-food restaurant.,20.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
98198,Mission Trail 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"Simple and slightly sweet, like the juice from canned peaches, pineapples and apricots, but with more acidity.",16.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
98204,Imagine Moore 2007 Joy Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"An unusual nose of cinnamon, lychee and Christmas spice holds promise. Unfortunately, the palate is one-dimensional and lacking in flavor intensity, though some pleasant banana flavors peak through briefly before dropping in to a short finish.",15.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
98303,Ferrari-Carano 2007 Prevail West Face Red (Alexander Valley),"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this interesting blend seems ready to drink now. It's soft and smooth in the mouth, with opulently ripe flavors of blackberries, chocolate, bacon, sweet oak, pepper and a touch of funk.",55.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
98370,:Nota Bene 2007 Miscela Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Bordeaux blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, the Miscela starts strong with a complex bouquet of black fruits, toast, smoke, coffee grounds and pencil shavings. The alcohol, listed at 15.4%, does not intrude, yet somehow it seems to mute the complexity. As a result, the finish turns astringent, drying, with a layer of ash drifting over the fruit.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
98726,Arbor Crest 2007 Wahluke Slope Vineyard Petite Sirah (Wahluke Slope),"This is a rather light, surprisingly delicate take on Petite Sirah, with pretty aromas of violets and spice. When first poured it seems shut down; it opens slowly but has a bit of a hole in the middle, before moving into a tannic finish with dark chocolate and licorice.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
98729,Calcareous 2007 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Throw some steaks on the barbie, or shrimp wrapped in bacon, or almost anything grillable, and then enjoy it with this soft, lush wine. Sure, it's high in alcohol, almost Porty, but that's the price of hitting the sweet spot of fruit and chocolate.",34.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99049,Lamoreaux Landing 2007 Estate Bottled Blanc de Blanc Sparkling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of earthy mushroom and brioche add depth and maturity to apple and orange-rind notes in this softly petillant sparkling. It's piercingly bright on the palate, with a high-toned lemon-lime acidity that lingers on the finish.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99119,:Nota Bene 2007 Conner Lee Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft, plump and fruity, this pleasing, pure Washington Merlot pushes black cherry, coffee and baking chocolate flavors into a roundly accessible wine with no rough edges at all. It's a quaffer with cojones.",32.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
99379,Cable Car 2007 Merlot (California),"A soft, simple, fruity Merlot. Tastes like a cherry, blackberry, roasted almond, cocoa and cinnamon granola bar, melted into wine.",10.0,83,1,0.9791730291902131
99475,Trefethen 2007 Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"Easily one of the best Napa Valley Merlots out there. The cool vintage and southerly valley origins have played a role in giving a firm, dry structure to the cherry, currant, olive, mushu plum sauce and herb flavors. A quality wine, distinctive and complex, and for the price, a relative value.",35.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
99477,Merryvale 2007 Oakville Grade Red (Napa Valley),"A beautiful, elegant and dramatic blend for drinking now and over the next 6–10 years. Based on Cabernet, and sourced from vineyards including Beckstoffer ToKalon and Showket, it's flashy in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with gorgeous, refined tannins. It's throwing some tannins, so you might want to give it a proper decant.",75.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
99555,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",46.0,94,1,0.9791730291902131
99568,Betz Family 2007 Clos de Betz Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bob Betz continues to refine his Bordeaux blends. This new Clos de Betz is much more forward than the monumental Père de Famille and sports ripe, dark, round, appealing fruit flavors of luscious raspberry and cassis, swathed in beaucoup de barrel. Toasty oak dissolves into polished tannins, finishing with black tea, licorice, smoke and charcoal.",45.0,93,1,0.9791730291902131
99712,Topel 2007 Cuvee Donnis Syrah (Mendocino),"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins. On the finish, it has a leathery tobacco note, with the richness of a cinnamon roll. Enjoy this with meaty dishes.",32.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
99752,Prager 2007 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Petite Sirah's big tannins are here, though the blackberry fruit notes are diluted. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",22.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
99769,Wagner 2007 Semi-Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"This sweet white starts with beguiling aromas of orange blossom, white flowers and spice. The flavors are mouthfilling and honeyed—a pretty balance of exotic fruits and crisp minerality. Pair with lighter cuisine or salads.",15.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
99778,Lakewood 2007 Gigliotti Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"The nose shows irresistable youthful notes of pear and apple while the palate is a bit simpler and fairly soft. Short, cherry-infused finish. Drink by the pool.",17.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
99783,Koehler 2007 Oak Savanna Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),"One of the better Sangioveses out there, because it avoids the pitfalls of unbalanced flavors and textures. It's a dry, crisply acidic wine that's ripe enough in cherries and cola to satisfy. Good job. The next step is to build in complexity.",35.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99787,St. Supéry 2007 Virtú White (Napa Valley),"Clean and crisp, this Sauvignon Blanc-Sémillon blend has flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and spices. It's technically dry, but finishes with honeysuckle sweetness.",25.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99789,Longoria 2007 Blues Cuvée Red (Santa Barbara County),"Fire up the grill, or pan fry a juicy steak to eat with this robust red wine, a Bordeaux blend with 24% Syrah. It's bone dry and tannic and juicy in berries, cherries, currants, leather and herbs, and while it's an easy sipper, the structure was harder to achieve than you might think.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99797,Dogwood 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino),"A lush, forward Zin whose fruity sweetness is accentuated by pairing with soft cheeses. Dry and soft, it offers flavors of briary forest berries, anise, black pepper and smoky sandalwood. A fine evocation of a cool-climate Zinfandel, although the alcohol is quite high. Drink now.",28.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99799,Erath 2007 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"Crisp and clean, this all-purpose white wine will please those who enjoy moderate (12.7% alcohol), stainless steel-fermented wines with clean fruit flavors. Apples and pears combine in the body of the wine, with a hint of cheese sticks in the finish.",15.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99802,Frick 2007 Owl Hill Vineyard Estate Bottled Counoise (Dry Creek Valley),"A bit sharp and weedy, and very dry, but it's a good, clean wine that trades structure for richness. Strong acids and tannins frame herb-infused flavors of cherries and red currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Drink now.",26.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
99815,D'Anbino 2007 Orchestration Red (Paso Robles),"Soft, sweet, hot and underripe, with vegetal flavors. Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",28.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
100126,Mojon's Bench 2007 Syncopation Red (Alexander Valley),"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah, this wine is very rich and extracted in pie-filling fruit flavors. The grapes certainly had no trouble getting ripe. It's a little heavy and soft in the mouth, and not likely to age, so drink now.",36.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100133,Terra d'Oro 2007 Zinfandel (Amador County),"A dry, tannic Zinfandel from Amador, fairly large production at 14,000 cases a year, with enough blueberry, sweet black olive and spice on the finish to make the whole package a nicely made bottling from a Sierra Foothills Zin specialist.",18.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100137,Taj 2007 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Nice blackberry, mocha, teriyaki beef and pepper flavors in this dry, smoothly tannic wine. It's too soft to show development in the bottle, but is pretty good for drinking now.",24.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100178,Fritz 2007 Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A little overripe, with a raisiny punch, but otherwise this is a nice, smooth and fruity wine. Show deep, chocolaty flavors of berries and pepper. Drink now.",40.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100180,Hard Row To Hoe 2007 Iron Bed Red Red (Wahluke Slope),"An easy-drinking red blend, made for near term enjoyment. The blend is 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Cab Franc, 10% Syrah and 10% Zinfandel. All quite ripe and wrapped in smoky chocolate. The finish gets a little chalky.",28.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100190,Terre Rouge 2007 DTR Ranch Syrah (Fiddletown),"This is a big, tannic and dry Syrah that seems built for the cellar, but an unripe note of green peppercorn verging on bell pepper rules that out. So drink now and appreciate the blackberries and oak.",38.0,86,1,0.9791730291902131
100194,Mission Hardware 2007 Winemaker's Select Old Sonoma Red (Sonoma Valley),"This Merlot-Zinfandel blend is very dry, full-bodied and rustic, with blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors that have bitter tobacco notes on the finish. Good with everyday fare.",14.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
100328,Sextant 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"High alcohol gives this wine a hot, glyceriney sweetness, and the blackberry fruit flavors veer into Porty raisins. Anyway you slice it, it's overripe.",33.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
100330,Vivác Winery 2007 Diavolo Red (New Mexico),"Stewed plums and black cherry preserve notes dusted with hints of chocolate and smoke are enjoyable, but there's a vein of leafy green and a touch of sourness that distracts from this wine's otherwise ample ripeness.",37.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
100637,Maddalena 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Still rather harsh, this is a rustic wine with cherry, cola and prune flavors. It's not for aging.",17.0,82,1,0.9791730291902131
100652,Paredon 2007 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This Syrah is overripe. It has a taste of raisins and prunes­—a baked, Porty quality—like the grapes had been grilled before being made into wine.",25.0,81,1,0.9791730291902131
100660,WillaKenzie Estate 2007 Gamay Noir (Willamette Valley),"A delightful bottle, this fruit-packed Gamay has more stuffing and sweetness than most of the Oregon Pinots from 2007. Plums, cherries and black currants ramble through the mouth, running into some fairly stiff, chewy tannins. This is a sturdy, immediately drinkable, thoroughly enjoyable quaffer.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
100662,Wilson 2007 Tori's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A big, heavy, full-bodied and ripe Zinfandel that needs rich, greasy meats and cheeses to tame it. The blackberry, currant and dry chocolate flavors are huge, and the tannins are even bigger, giving this extremely dry wine an astringent finish.",44.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
100671,Hawley 2007 Ponzo Vineyard Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"Brawny, briary, rustic, tannic, fruity, these are just a few words to describe this wine. It's a true barbecue companion, a big, powerful, full-bodied wine with blackberry and pepper flavors. Drink now and through 2012.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
100718,Clif Family 2007 Gary's Improv Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Intricate flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and honey-nut granola mark this deliciously dry wine, spiced with exotic cinnamon, star anise and pepper. It's very good, although it could have a firmer structure. Ready now.",35.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
100726,Nickel & Nickel 2007 Suscol Ranch Merlot (Napa Valley),"Made in the Nickel & Nickel style, which is very dry and considerably more tannic than its peers in Napa Valley, this Merlot needs some time in the cellar to shed its astringency and let the cherries blossom. The vineyard is in a cooler, southerly part of the valley.",55.0,89,1,0.9791730291902131
100859,Lucas & Lewellen 2007 Valley View Vineyard Petit Verdot (Santa Barbara County),"Even nearing the age of four, this wine can't quite overcome its rustic tannins and sharp finish, and never will. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors, it will wash down a nice steak.",32.0,85,1,0.9791730291902131
100871,Artezin 2007 Charbono (Napa Valley),"Some unripe notes of vegetables mar this otherwise likeable wine. It's very dry and soft, with firm tannins and cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors.",30.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
100885,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"A rich, broad nose of tropical fruit, citrus and flowers starts this full-bodied white. Round flavors of orange, melon and spice are delivered in a mouth-filling wave. Good for heavier dishes and poultry.",11.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
100888,Del Rio 2007 Viognier (Rogue Valley),"This smells— and remarkably it also tastes—like bubble gum, with some pineapple tossed in for good measure. Peaches and apricots? Not so much; this is definitely an atypical Viognier, but brings plenty of candied fruit to the table.",20.0,84,1,0.9791730291902131
100893,Martin Ray 2007 Synthesis Red (Napa Valley),"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years.",75.0,95,1,0.9791730291902131
100961,Fenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"A rich, full Petite Sirah with a taste of cola and spice followed by ripe raspberry and blackberry. A very yummy version of the variety from one of Livemore's most promising vineyards.",25.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
101067,St. Amant 2007 The Road Less Travelled Tempranillo (Amador County),"This 100% Tempranillo will linger with you for a while, a real thinking wine that takes time to reveal its power. Properly tannic—have a hearty meal at the ready—the St. Amant is structurally sound and yet concentrated with sweet notes of toffee, vanilla and brown sugar on the finish, its dark fruit both subtle and ripe. From the foothills of Amador County on a relatively cool site, the wine is aged in both French and American oak (35% new).",18.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
101068,Star Lane Vineyard 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dark, full-bodied and a little ponderous, showing firm tannins and blackberry, blueberry, plum, mocha and spice flavors that finish dry and spicy. Lacks some complexity, but overall a good red to wash down grilled meats.",32.0,87,1,0.9791730291902131
101282,Watermill 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The newest vintage ramps up the complexity of this wine, while keeping the fruit front and center. Good concentrated flavors run through all the citrus and into the stone fruits; there is just a hint of cardboard on the end. Light toast is there if you look for it.",15.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
101295,Pacific Rim 2007 Gewürztraminer (Washington),"This unusual blend of grapes from both Washington and Oregon shows that each state can profit from the other. The Oregon grapes give more structure, acid, and delicate spice notes; while the baseline Washington fruit—melon and passion fruit—is bright and tangy and annotated with citrus andtangerine.",11.0,88,1,0.9791730291902131
