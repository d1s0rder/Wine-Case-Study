45,Casa Silva 2008 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot (Colchagua Valley),"This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness.

236,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region),"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry.

246,Kaiken 2008 Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot Red (Mendoza),"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla.

284,Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor.

299,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",15.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477

871,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.

2071,Damalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro),"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate.

4436,Matsu 2008  Toro,"A big, burly wine that's loaded with power and fruit but is also tannic and drying. Tastes sort of raisiny and hot, with grating tannic scrub and fire in the hole.

The palate offers clean and spritzy character with a wave of rounding tropical fruit and a spin of spice. Pair with spicy food—think Indian or Thai.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
5798,Inniskillin 2008 Ice Wine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of freshly pressed apple, wildflower honey and tangerine peel, this is a richly textured, almost creamy, ice wine. Intense flavors of honey and fresh apple ripple on the palate, with striking lemon acidity that lends a squeaky clean finish.",80.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
6037,Emmerich Knoll 2008 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"The Knoll Grüner style is for a hint of steel, doses of minerality and not too much ornateness despite the wonderfully elaborate traditional bottle labels. The intense fruit, spice and peach character is balanced by acidity, a taut, nervy edge. It will certainly age for 5–6 years.",50.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
6214,Brampton 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"This is a structured, balanced white with aromas of gooseberry, flint and spice on the nose, and flavors of fresh citrus and fruit on the palate. Clean and crisp but offering complexity, this wine marries rich fruit and cracking acid very successfully. Pair with spicy Indian cuisine, grilled seafood.",11.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
6305,Markus Molitor 2008 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",30.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
6355,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2008 Los Vascos Rosé (Colchagua Valley),"Having liked the 2007 rosé from Los Vascos, this pickled, citric burner just doesn't cut it. It shows Sauvignon Blanc-like flavors and acidity, while the finish is sour and briney. Devoid of the charm and pleasantries that rosé should deliver.",12.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
6620,Clarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon),"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.",75.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
6765,Juan Gil 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla),"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
6783,Chrysorroyiatissa 2008 Ayios Andronicos White (Cyprus),"An alluring nose of apples, flowers and citrus lead this delicate white from Cyprus. Pretty, unfolding flavors of apple, flowers and citrus are backed by good acidity and a touch of spice.",17.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
6791,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Elements of this thick, ripe, almost late-harvest SB succeed. The palate is creamy and layered, and it works that angle to its advantage. By the same token, it's flat and won't last for much longer, and the finish is pithy and borderline cloying. Drink right away.",19.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
6795,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Amethystos Sauvignon Blanc (Drama),"This sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc sets itself apart with its rich nose of nuts, vanilla and flowers, followed by pretty flavors of spice and white flowers and fruit. Acidity balances the fruit. A fuller-bodied style that can handle richer seafood dishes.",22.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
6798,Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Dark and baked, with hickory, leather and prune/black plum aromas that are slightly herbal and roasted.

6801,Protopapas 2008 Traminer (Pageon),"This slightly sweet white starts with a lush nose of flowers, orange marmalade and spice, followed by floral flavors edged with spice and minerals.

7166,Dão Sul 2008 Quinta das Tecedeiras Flor de Tecedeiras Red (Douro),"This second wine from Dão Sul's Douro quinta shows the bright fruity side of the region. It's a lively, fresh, red fruit flavored wine, with soft tannins and a ready to drink feel.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
7259,Campolargo 2008 Vinha da Costa Red (Bairrada),"Merlot and Syrah join Tinta Roriz in this impressive wine. A fermentation in open lagars as well as time in oak give this blend richness and a deliciously juicy. Ripe and full bodied, it is ready to drink.",58.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
7350,Brancott 2008 B Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"One of Brancott's best Sauvignons in recent memory, the 2008 B is intensely herbal on the nose, featuring green tomatoes and bell pepper, but only mildly vegetal on the palate--well within the bounds of acceptable varietal character. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with a long, mouth-tingling finish. Try with sole Basquaise.",26.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
7377,Stratus 2008 Icewine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"This wine is the vinous equivalent of biting into a ripe, juicy mango that has been drizzled with honey. It's viscous and full in feel, loaded with tropical flavors that linger on the finish. Perhaps a bit one note but represents it well.",70.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
7417,Korta Katarina 2008 Posip (Korčula),"Waxy and floral on the nose with hints of zesty orange peel, this dry, full bodied white is richly concentrated with tangerine, lime and fresh apple flavors. It's bold at 13.6% abv, but maintains a crisp, citrus pith astringency and orange blossom elegance to the finish.",24.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
7571,Trapiche 2008 Gran Medalla Malbec (Mendoza),"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas.

7615,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2008 Quinta dos Loridos Branco Alvarinho (Lisboa),"Delicious fresh citrus flavored wine, bright as a button, lively and crisp. Made from Alvarinho, there is a creamy texture with a mineral element, finishing with green plums and banana flavors.",15.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
7811,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
8505,Gunter Triebaumer 2008 Trie Weiss White (Burgenland),"Relatively full, and perfumed with grapes from the Muscat family, this is a perfect apéritif wine. It has a texture of pear skins, with kiwi fruit and a final finishing softness, lifted by very fresh, dry acidity. Screwcap.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
8507,Zeal 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Crisp, citrusy and slightly herbal, this is a well made, mainstream Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc at a terrific price.",11.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
8519,Calcu 2008 Red Wine Red (Colchagua Valley),"Dark and minerally, with black fruits, char and power on the nose. The palate is fresh and grippy, with integrated cassis, berry and herb flavors.

8698,Emilio Moro 2008 Finca Resalso  (Ribera del Duero),"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
8703,Trapiche 2008 Broquel Malbec (Mendoza),"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",17.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8708,Bodegas del Muni 2008 Corpus del Muni Roble Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",20.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8710,Capa 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8712,J. & F. Lurton 2008 Barco Negro Red (Douro),"A lean style bringing out acidity from the juicy black currant fruits. It has definite tannins supporting the fruit, while it finishes with fresh, perhaps too fresh, acidity.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8714,O. Fournier 2008 Urban Ribera  (Ribera del Duero),"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8718,Bodegas Bleda 2008 Castillo de Jumilla Monastrell (Jumilla),"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
8760,San Pedro de Yacochuya 2008 Malbec (Cafayate),"Aromas of raisin and cooked black fruits are malty. This high-alcohol Malbec feels hard, tannic and collapsed. Stewy nutty flavors of blackberry and prune come with a dash of salt, while this shows raisiny flavors and dry tannins on a heavy finish.",58.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
8970,Nick Goldschmidt 2008 Boulder Bank Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt plies his trade mainly in California, but this effort from his native country is a winner, featuring a lush mix of nectarine, melon and tomato leaf that finishes long and harmoniously.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
8973,Arboleda 2008 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A strong, smoky set of aromas gets this going in the proper direction. There's also spice, earth, herbal aromas and leather to give it variety. The palate is deep and big, with blackberry, smoked meat and richness. Smooth on the finish, with black olive and additional herbal accents.",19.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
9005,Bulgariana 2008 Imperial Red (Thracian Valley),"Comprised of 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Rubin, and 5% Mavrud, it offers aromas of blackberry, cherry vanilla and cinnamon.

9080,Colomé 2008 Reserva Malbec (Calchaquí Valley),"Smells cheesy and leathery, with herbal notes. Feels condensed and flat, as if it's collapsing on itself. Flavors of baked berry and prune are dark and typical of very ripe Malbec, while the finish is warm but basic in feel and flavor. Bullish, sweet and heavy. Not Colomé's best effort, especially given the price.",90.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
9149,O. Fournier 2008 Spiga  (Ribera del Duero),"Tight and gritty on the bouquet, with licorice and herbal aromas. Comes across hard and tannic in the mouth, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Tannic like nails on the finish, with lemony oak notes.",31.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477

9361,Tierra Prometida 2008 Clasico Malbec (Mendoza),"Opens with minerally, almost metallic aromas, along with rubber and berry mixed in. Feels fresh and ready, with plum, berry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes with a smooth feel, but maybe it could use a bit more cut and tannic structure. A wine that falls squarely in the middle zone.",18.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
9426,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Rosé (Coastal Region),"A cheerful nose of raspberry, strawberry and lemon starts this rosé blend, and like flavors follow in layers that offer substance beyond the typical rosé. The wine has a touch of sweetness and a more unctuous mouthfeel than the nose might suggest, giving it the weight to pair with more complex dishes. Overall, an affordable, elegant choice.",10.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
9490,Viñedo de los Vientos 2008 Angel's Cuvée Ripasso de Tannat (Atlantida),"Oak, vanilla and furry berry aromas are raisiny and overly sweet.

9573,Pinord 2008 Clos del Mas Red (Priorat),"Spearmint chewing gum, cassis and raisin aromas are friendly. However, on the palate this wine rings hollow, with little structure and hardly any midpalate. The flavors of candied red fruits are basic, while the finish shows residual raspberry flavor and no complexity.",30.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
9646,Luis Duarte 2008 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano),"His skills show in this rich, powerful, finely balanced wine. It has layers of black berry fruits, damsons, bitter chocolate and a good core of acidity. Give this impressive wine 3–4 years.",23.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
9827,Terrazas de Los Andes 2008 Single Vineyard Las Compuertas Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"A bit leafy and earthy on first take, but this also smells of roasted meat, berry fruit and menthol. It feels layered and rich, with drying tannins and full-force plum and herb flavors. This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.",45.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
9899,Finca del Marquesado 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy aromas of brandied cherry, spiced berry and coconut require lengthy airing to shed murky, damp notes.

10086,Estate Biblia Chora 2008 Areti Agiorgitiko (Pangeon),"This expressive red starts with aromas of raspberry, sour cherry and vanilla, leading into a medium-bodied, mouthfilling array of fruit, spice and a touch of sweetness.

10296,Enrique Mendoza 2008 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante),"The bouquet on this blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is toasty and elevated, a clear invitation to dig in.

10319,D'Arenberg 2008 The Galvo Garage Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills),"A bold, aggressive wine that lacks a bit of elegance, the 2008 Galvo Garage is a big mouthful of cassis and cedar. In another few years it may settle down, but for now the overall impression is of a rather rough customer that's best suited to be poured alongside grilled steak.",29.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
10504,Kilikanoon 2008 Killerman's Run Shiraz-Grenache (Australia),"A blend of two-thirds Shiraz, one-third Grenache, Kilikanoon's entry-level blend is a soft, easygoing combination of blackberries, cola, brown sugar and cinnamon. Drink it over the next year or two.",20.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
10700,Poças 2008 Vale de Cavalos Red (Douro),"Smooth wine, the wood aging underlaying the cherry and ripe plum fruit flavors. It is powerful, yes, although there is a great sense of style from the ripe fruit integrated into rich tannins and final acidity.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
10702,Quinta do Vale Meão 2008 Meandro do Vale Meão Red (Douro),"Meandro, named after the horseshoe bend on the Douro that surrounds the Vale Meão vineyard, is the second wine from this quinta.

10915,Alamos 2008 Torrontés (Salta),"Chunky and a bit dull smelling, with apple, melon and peach aromas. Papaya and green melon flavors seem to be flattening with age, and the finish is long but nondescript. Drink now or wait for the '09. Imported by Alamos USA.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477

11139,Finca Sophenia 2008 Altosur Malbec (Tupungato),"Opens with earthy muscle but the nose soon loses focus and freshness as it transitions to rubber and paste along with berry fruit. Hard tannins work the driving palate, while the flavors are of black plum, grape jelly and herbs. Decent but doesn't inspire.",11.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
11144,O. Fournier 2008 Urban Uco Malbec (Uco Valley),"Floral blueberry aromas are candied, artificial smelling and sweet, and the palate is supremely rich, sweet, candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec, but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.",11.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
11148,Bodega Goulart 2008 T Torrontés (Luján de Cuyo),"Oily matchstick aromas run counter to the wine's innocuous color. The palate is light in weight but heavy in blossomy flavors of orange, lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits. Lacks the lychee/tropical quality that makes Torrontés special, and finishes bitter and pithy.",12.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
11275,El Coto 2008 Coto Real Reserva  (Rioja),"Tobacco, dill and vanilla aromas transition to cherry and raspberry scents.

11279,Pascual Toso 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"As per usual, Toso's regular varietal Malbec is pleasing, honest and shows the variety in its best, affordable form.

Sweet and sizable for a $9 wine, with toast, coffee and controlled bitterness on the finish.",9.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
12004,Vinha Paz 2008 Colheita Red (Dão),"The structure is the thing here, a square, firmly tannic wine. The dry core of this impressive wine spreads out to the dark plum skin and loganberry flavors, solid and finely angled.",19.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
12005,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Azul Portugal Red (Dão),"Classic tannic Dão Touriga Nacional, packed with minerality, dark and dry tannins, firm and with a good juicy final character. Part of a range of wines from across the country under the name Azul Portugal.",10.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
12069,Galil Mountain 2008 Barbera (Upper Galilee),"This Barbera has an almost Pinot-like character to it, with hints of coffee, earthy tobacco and mushroom to the red cherry fruit profile. It's lightweight and easy drinking, with a softly woody finish. Drink now.",18.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
12084,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Thick, raisiny and a heavy on first take, with meaty aromas. Feels jammy and soft, but the middle layers aren't well defined. Tastes dark and sweet, with fig, prune and lemony oak. Bulky, but struggles to reach a higher plane.",23.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
12097,Finca Agostino 2008 Agostino Familia Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza),"This opens with smoky, powerful aromas of black fruit and oak. The palate feels flush, offering several levels of character and complexity. Flavorwise, this pulses with blackberry, cassis and fudge, before finishing with subtle prune, mint and chocolate notes. Not edgy or hard. A blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet and Syrah.",30.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
12359,Baron De Ley 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Gritty stalky aromas suggest that the original material for this Gran Reserva was not fully ripe. This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins. Stalky flavors of herbal raspberry and plum come with oaky vanilla accents and tomatoey spice on the finish.",30.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
12384,Familia Schroeder 2008 Saurus Patagonia Sauvignon Blanc (Neuquén),"A simple but reasonably good white wine. Applesauce and citrus aromas are fruity and clean, while the mango-orange palate is tasty, a little sweet and citric. Pithy on the finish but mellow overall.",12.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
12394,Callia 2008 Alta Pinot Grigio (Tulum Valley),"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
12417,Viña Mayor 2008 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Loamy aromas of cherry and plum give off a sense of baked maturity, while a floral bath-soap note is ethereal. This feels lush, deep and on the cusp of full maturity. A generous mix of plum, berry and chocolate flavors ends with spice notes and a creamy feel. Drink through 2020.",36.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
12433,Gemtree 2008 Luna Roja Tempranillo (McLaren Vale),"Cropped at less than two tons per acre, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Tempranillo marked by vanilla-tinged oak. Black cherries and plums comprise the core, with embellishments of tobacco adding complexity to this lush, easy-drinking wine. Drink it over the next several years.",20.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477

12563,Valentin Bianchi 2008 Elsa Syrah,"Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.",9.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
12564,Vila 2008 Merlot (Mendoza),"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",10.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
12570,Bodegas Copaboca 2008  Toro,"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",9.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
12575,Bodegas Navarro López 2008 Rojo Granrojo Garnacha (Tierra de Castilla),"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",9.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
12666,Marqués de Murrieta 2008 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy, dry aromas of plum and cherry come with notes of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and leather. This feels fresh, acidic and generally well balanced. Flavors of spiced plum and berry are riper than many 2008s from Rioja, while a finish with tobacco and leathery flavors is solid and fairly long. Drink through 2020.",26.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
12672,Roxanich 2008 Ines in White White (Istria),"Sure to please any wine-geek, this orange wine is a blend of seven grapes including Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Reisling Italica, Glera, Fruilano, Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc. It's aged for three years in large wooden vats and has aromas of dried nectarine, dried peach, apricot and freshly ground black pepper that lead to luscious flavors of apricot nectar and honeycomb.",41.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
12691,Sauska 2008 Cuvée 11 Red (Villány),"Sauska's premiere bottling, the Cuvée 11 has a hefty dose of Cabernet Franc, giving it a distinct spice and bramble character. It's not a dainty wine at 15% abv, but the palate is clean with focused red fruit accented by fresh herbs and balanced tannins.",37.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
12867,Finca El Portillo 2008 Estate Bottled Malbec (Uco Valley),"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel. Finishes with a taste of powdered drink mix and grape bubblegum. Decent but shows all the signs of the large-production, commercial wine that it is.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
12916,Santa Alicia 2008 Millantu Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Carmenère Red (Maipo Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is the best wine from Santa Alicia I've come across. The nose is spicy, dry and delivers earthy cherry and plum aromas. It feels right and tastes of spicy raspberry and plum, with a fruity, complex finish. A good wine for food with nice acidity; drink now–2015.",30.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
13100,Petaluma 2008 Hanlin Hill Riesling (Clare Valley),"Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",20.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
13119,D'Arenberg 2008 The Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (McLaren Vale),"This Grenache-based blend derives considerable structure from its Shiraz (38%) and Mourvèdre (7%) components, giving it more firmness, length and ageability than might be expected. Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10–12.",65.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
13158,Familia Deicas 2008 Don Pascual Reserve Tannat (Juanico),"Hard cherry and nail polish aromas rise up from the glass. The palate is high in acid and clampy, with tart, leafy, rubbery berry fruit flavors. Dry and reasonably fresh on the finish.",12.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
13173,DSG Vineyards 2008 Phincalali  (Rioja),"Grapey and pinched on the nose, jammy smelling and unconvincing. Supernarrow in the mouth, tannic, lemony and sucks the life out of your cheeks and palate. And that's not even mentioning the price.",75.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
13244,Argento 2008 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Saturated in color almost to the point of opaque. The nose is brash, with rubbery berry, chocolate and sandalwood aromas. Intense but not overpowering, with flavors of sweet black plum, berry and black currant. Spry and lively throughout, with licorice and bitter chocolate on the finish.",13.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
13344,Brokenwood 2008 Cricket Pitch Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot-Petit Verdot Red (South Eastern Australia),"Dark hints of charred oak and cola accent bright berry aromas, while the palate is marked by bold berry and black cherry flavors and a whack of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that comes across as a bit hard-edged because of its acidity despite having rather soft tannins. Drink now.",21.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
13359,St Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz-Grenache-Touriga Red (Barossa),"Fresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like. Drink now–2013.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
13531,Melipal 2008 Rosé Malbec (Mendoza),"Raspberry and cherry aromas are light and pleasing, while the palate exhibits those same friendly and inviting raspberry flavors along with some citrus.

13642,Ramón Bilbao 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Initially, this may smell a bit hot and leafy, but with time that quality settles. It feels narrow, tannic and condensed, with roasted flavors of red berry, spice and chocolate. The finish offers a mix of citrus, red berry and herb flavors.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
13731,Angove's 2008 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia),"A lean, streamlined version of Aussie Shiraz, with leathery notes of dried currants that finish firm and crisp.",11.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
13775,Beronia 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"This is a very ripe and raisiny specimen from a rocky vintage. It's chunky and somewhat grating in the mouth, with balance issues. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors finish without much structure or spine. Drink now.",21.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
13918,Niepoort 2008 Vertente Red (Douro),"Smooth and fresh, packed with juicy fruit, this is an immediately accessible, young wine. Black currant and plum juice, bright acidity. Drink next year.",30.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
14070,Spiropoulos 2008 Made with Organic Grapes Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"Notes of cola, black pepper and cocoa on the nose are followed by touches of red cherry, cedar and spice in this elegant red. It has a dry, sophisticated character but good red fruit roundness to balance the package.",45.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14175,Dinastía Vivanco 2008 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de Mazuelo  (Rioja),"A crusty smelling wine with aromas of crude oil, roasted nuts and modest berry fruit.

14352,Barahonda 2008 Heredad Candela Monastrell (Yecla),"A bit scratchy, leathery and herbal on the bouquet, but there's also a stony character and raspberry aromas. It feels crisp and a bit sheering, with flavors of zesty red fruit, citrus and vanilla filling in the gaps. The finish is long and lightly oaky.",25.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14396,Bodegas Bilbainas 2008 Viña Zaco  (Rioja),"Ultratight cherry and plum aromas create a lean red fruit profile.

14397,Bodegas Palacio 2008 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja),"Harsh and nervy on the nose, with early aromas of horseradish and chemical that subside with airing.

14407,Sierra de Viento 2008 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena),"Herbal up front, with pine aromas in addition to berry and plum. The palate is tannic and kind of gritty feeling, with medicinal cherry and candied berry flavors. Finishes sweet, with some burn.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
14441,O. Fournier 2008 Alfa Centauri Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Merlot Red (Maule Valley),"This is dense, lusty and attractive from the beginning, with rich black-fruit, coconut, tobacco and pine aromas. It feels pure and deep, with ribald acids that keep the pulse up and push blackberry, plum and savory cured-meat flavors. The finish remains savory and saucy. Drink this Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend now–2017.",45.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
14448,Estampa 2008 Lacruz Red (Colchagua Valley),"At first it almost smells too Port-like, but then peppery spice enters the picture and it takes off. And while it weighs a ton and shows some aggression, it's lovable for its pure blackberry and complex spice and chocolate flavors. Long and grabby on the finish, with big tannins. Drink now, or hold through 2020.",55.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
14505,Clos Berenguer del Molar 2008 Selecció Syrah (Priorat),"Dense black cherry and stewed plum aromas introduce this round, jammy and ultraripe Syrah. In the mouth, the wine is rich and chunky, with brandied cherry and baked berry and plum flavors topped with sprinkles of nutmeg and cumin. Nothing evaporates on the ripe finish.

14941,Pratsch 2008 Steinberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"A full-in-the-mouth, fat, oily-textured wine, the acidity going with spice and a peppered pear fruit character. It's ripe, still young, with a very clean character and a waft of fresh acidity. Screwcap.",30.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14942,Tomero 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14950,François Lurton 2008 Hacienda Araucano Humo Blanco Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley),"The yellow color and doughnutty, honeyed aromas give it away: this is barrel-fermented, Bordeaux-style SB. The nose is barrique heaven, but the vanilla and resin qualities are stylish. Creamy but balanced in the mouth, with flavors of oak, vanilla, spice, honey and baked apple. Smooth stuff but very oaky, and not for everyone.",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14952,Hans Moser 2008 Klausen Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland),"A rounded style of Sauvignon Blanc, but one that doesn't lose sight of its herbaceous element. So there is crispness, a vivacious acidity, but also flavors of creamy apple and ripe pear. To drink this year.",27.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
14953,Kaiken 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",14.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
15150,Quinta do Vallado 2008 Touriga Nacional (Douro),"A perfumed, spicy and ripe wine, wood flavors balanced by great wafts of black fruit. It is elegant, with a significant wood element. It will develop over 3–4 years, bringing more of the fine berry fruits.",55.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
15158,Weingut Am Stein 2008 Stettener Stein Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Franken),"The continental nature of Franconia only allows Riesling to prosper in locations such as this, where the special microclimate has imbued this wine with honeyed ripeness, a medium-bodied, creamy texture and hints of peachy fruit.",32.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
15162,J. Garcia Carrion 2008 Antaño Reserva  (Rioja),"The wine is earthy, leathery and leafy on the nose. In the mouth, hard tannins lead to a stalky tasting, lightly baked set of mature black-fruit flavors. Carob and raisin flavors along with rubbery tannins define the finish",12.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
15181,Quinta de Arcossó 2008 Superior Red (Trás-os-Montes),"New wood aromas give minty character to this wine. The palate is dominated by that wood, which covers the fruit and just leaves structure. Considering that the wine is now five years old, this imbalance will probably remain.",73.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
15276,Agustí Torelló Mata 2008 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Bready, yeasty apple and pear aromas come with grassy hints and notes of green herbs. As a brut nature, it's no surprise that this hits with straight-ahead acidity and crispness. Flavors of sourdough bread, lemon and golden apple finish stony, tight and minerally. Drink through 2019.",27.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
15314,Altaïr 2008 Red (Cachapoal Valley),"With distinct aromas of field herbs, asphalt, gritty mineral, herbal berry and burnt toast, this is a challenging blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot. The palate hits hard with aggressive tannins and abrasive acidity, while flavors of baked black fruits and coconut announce loud oak. This finishes hard and gritty, with a mule's kick.",80.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
15392,Cesca Vicent 2008 Abat Domènech Red (Priorat),"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes.

15410,Señorio de Valdiestro 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Soft, low-intensity aromas of raisin, marzipan and cedar announce a wine that's not in the best of shape.

Long, with a persistent layered, minerally finish.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
15423,Alta Vista 2008 Atemporal Red (Mendoza),"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",25.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
15435,Wittmann 2008 Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Slightly closed at first, but slowly opens to reveal ripe stone fruits, hints of white flowers and an earthy minerality. Dry, with racy acidity that is balanced by lots of lively stone-fruit and citrus flavors. Palate is nicely taut and elegant. Moderately long, juicy finish.",25.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
15602,Carl Ehrhard 2008 Rudesheimer Kabinett Dry Riesling (Rheingau),"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development. It's stony and layered with honeyed citrus without being sweet, with a wiry feel to the lingering finish. Drink now.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
15612,Santa Carolina 2008 VSC Red (Maipo Valley),"Herbal, leathery aromas give way to a pretty strong blast of green that infiltrates the wine. Alongside the herbal, green core character is spiced chocolate, dark berry fruit and blazing acidity. This is full, saturated and masculine, with raking tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot.",30.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
15657,Veramonte 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Veramonte knows how to capture the pungent, alert character inherent to Sauvignon Blanc. This is a peppy wine with spiky tropical and green-fruit aromas and flavors. It's a mash up of citrus and nettles, with a controlled, fairly long grapefruit-driven finish. Modest in price, but the realthing.",13.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
15659,Casa Marin 2008 Cipreses Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"Convincing and individual across its aromas, flavors and nuances. Casa Marin is a leader in coastal Sauvignon Blanc, and this full-bodied, racy wine grabs your attention with its crisp, pure personality.

The green and yellow fruits fill the mouth, round but always with a layer of crispness. Everything comes together, the fruit, the acidity and the rich undertow of spice. Screwcap.",35.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
16215,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Smooth berry aromas have a vanilla leaning due to ample oak.

16289,Septima 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Creamy dark-berry aromas carry a floral, blueberry hint, while the thick palate teeters on syrupy as it delivers gummy, mildly baked black fruit flavors.

16465,Ideal Drinks 2008 Colinas Reserva Red (Bairrada),"Densely tannic, this is a dark, rich, intense wine. The mature dusty tannins are balanced by acidity, black currant fruitiness and finished with a dry core. It's ready to drink.",20.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477

16604,Casca Wines 2008 Monte Cascas Colheita Red (Douro),"A firmly tannic wine, with a woody core. It shows stalky black currant fruit along with tense acidity. At this stage, it is rough round the edges and could use  another year.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477

16618,Santa Ema 2008 Reserve Barrel Select Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Saturated purple in color and grapy on the nose. The palate is mouthfilling but carries semisharp acidity, and the flavors run in the direction of standard black fruit.

The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character, while the palate is edgy, hard and bitter, with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.",45.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
17217,Malat 2008 Gottweiger Berg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"The slopes below the Stift Gottweig monastery are the source of this attractively crisp, light wine, its acidity and fresh fruit a pure pleasure to drink.

17730,Juvé y Camps 2008 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava),"Normally I'm a fan of Juvé y Camps. This bottling is bland on the nose, with a cleaning-solution aroma. The palate is foamy in feel and short in flavor, with a strange blend of bitter lettuce, brine and green herbs. Frankly, it's not up to par, a possible reflection of the below-average 2008 vintage.",17.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
17741,Sattlerhof 2008 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Regarded as a Styrian Grand Cru, the Kranachberg produces landmark Sauvignon Blanc.

Drink now.",50.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
18726,Concha y Toro 2008 Xplorador Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"True bargains are hard to come by, so drop your guard for this $8 SB and you may wind up happy. Xplorador from Concha Y Toro is peachy and simple, with light grassiness and green notes. But it does have a plump, neutral palate and likable pineapple and apple flavors.

19032,San Pedro 2008 Castillo de Molina Shiraz (Maule Valley),"Dark in color, smoky and full of coconut and mocha aromas. However, the palate is more acidic, tight and starching than ideal.

19035,Caliterra 2008 Tributo Single Vineyard Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Vanilla, wood shavings, charcoal and floral berry aromas come with a hint of minty green. The palate has a healthy but common grabbiness to it, with flavors of black cherry, cassis and herbs. Almost cloying on the finish, with candied notes and vanilla.

19042,Eikendal 2008 Merlot (Stellenbosch),"Peppery notes emanate from the bouquet first, followed by more traditional notes of black plum, black currant leaf and dried fig.

19044,Gauchezco 2008 Oro Malbec (Mendoza),"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors.

19226,Manyana 2008 Tempranillo (Cariñena),"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean.

21012,Cono Sur 2008 Organically Grown Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Hard and inky on first blush, with aromas of shoe polish and wild, aggressive fruit. A far more narrow and acidic wine than we expected to find, with racy, short, blue fruit flavors. Bright and choppy, with a short finish. Seems underdeveloped.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
21014,Carmen 2008 Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Racy and tight-bodied red wine, with a strained, herbal set of aromas and a high-acid, razor's-edge palate of lively red fruit flavors and an offset of drying oak. Too generic and tough on the cheeks to tip the scale.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477

21802,Portal del Montsant 2008 Santbru Carinyenes Velles Red (Montsant),"This dark, exotic blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is impressive given that 2008 wasn't a good year in Spain. This shows integrated oak, graphite and inky aromas in front of a full, balanced palate that's home to berry flavors, schisty minerality and mocha accents. A generous finish with plum and berry flavors as well as licorice is the right ending. Drink through 2018.",42.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
21928,In Situ 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"More than decent; this is good SB with no bells and whistles but lots of straight-ahead competence. The nose is dusty and plump, while the palate has roundness, weight and likable citrus, green melon and other common, fresh flavors. Sometimes the basics are more than enough; this is a casein point.",5.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
21931,La Playa 2008 Block Selection Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley),"This is a perfectly good and honest wine, with aromas of fresh lettuce yet not a whole lot of vivid fruit. So in that sense, it is like many SBs from cool-climate Limarí. But if the nose is shy, the palate offers nice, cheerful apple and melon flavors. Smooth enough and almost round, withno edgy acidity or overt zap.",11.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
21934,Montes 2008 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues.

21935,Nuevomundo 2008 Estate Bottled Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Our expectations for Maipo SB are usually tempered, but this is good and secure. The nose is light and honest, while the palate offers forward grapefruit, orange and lime flavors. The feel is full and comfortable, and it finishes and settles well and a little green. Drink right away.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
21937,Goldwater 2008 Wairau Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Fresh and zippy, this is loaded with lime and passion fruit flavors, tinged with just enough herbal character to give it that distinctive Marlborough tang.",18.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
21953,Oveja Negra 2008 The Lost Barrel Red (Maule Valley),"Wiry on the nose, with herbal, punchy, slightly strained red fruit aromas that suggest rhubarb. The palate is amorphous and standard, with lightly baked, mildly stewy blackberry and herbal flavors. On the finish, it's pure tobacco, chocolate and coffee.

22000,Viña Borgia 2008 Grenache (Campo de Borja),"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.",6.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
22011,Fitapreta Vinhos 2008 Sexy Branco White (Alentejano),"A superripe, soft wine, all pear and yellow fruit flavors, touched with apricot juice and light honey and lemon. The wine rolls smoothly with a light texture of pear skins.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477

22021,Emina 2008 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
22023,Errazuriz 2008 Single Vineyard Syrah (Aconcagua Valley),"A deep, dark Syrah with cola, spice, pepper, cedar and olive notes to go with more familiar blackberry and mocha.

22097,Finca Decero 2008 Amano Remolinos Vineyard Red (Agrelo),"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice. Quite oaky but the oak comes across well, i.e. friendly mocha and coffee. 64% Malbec with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Tannat.",50.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
22098,Castello d'Alba 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"Wood-aged wine that shows pedigree and style. It has red berry fruit flavors, firm tannins along with acidity and a dry core. It's a serious wine, for aging over 4–5 years.",14.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
22099,Dão Sul 2008 Casa de Santar Red (Dão),"There is certainly some of the Dão minerality in the texture of this wine. It's main thrust is berry fruit, which is filled out with some attractive tannins, spice from wood and final acidity.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
22303,Tegernseerhof 2008 Höhereck Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Martin Mittelbach rolls out this intense, concentrated wine, which packs spice, ripe pineapple and apricots and a final floral character that fills the mouth. A wine to age for at least four years. Screwcap.",40.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
22392,Yalumba 2008 Shiraz-Viognier (Eden Valley),"This is the midlevel entry in Yalumba's Shiraz-Viognier range, slotting in above the Y Series but below the Hand Picked. It's a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured wine, with prominent green olive and peppercorn nuances to its plummy flavors. It fades a little on the finish, so drink now–2013.",19.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
22406,Marqués de la Concordia 2008 Hacienda Abascal Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Drawn and leathery on the nose, and then as it opens it reveals citrusy red fruit aromas.

22420,Vallobera 2008 Javier San Pedro Reserva  (Rioja),"Dry, spicy, woody, earthy berry aromas are common for Rioja. This is bouncy and full of tomato-like acidity, while favors of tobacco, reedy berry fruits and spice are a touch green in the middle. On the finish, this is rough but true to the vintage, which was notoriously cold, wet and difficult.",24.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
22474,Emilio Moro 2008 Malleolus de Valderramiro  (Ribera del Duero),"Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013–2018.",212.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
22549,Viña Casablanca 2008 Nimbus Estate Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"This new brand from Santa Carolina is improving with each passing vintage.

22556,Porcupine Ridge 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"The nose on this Sauvignon ranges from tropical fruit to green grass, and on the palate, a classy balance of acid and fruit, with a minerally backbone and a dry, crisp finish.

22594,John Duval Wines 2008 Eligo Shiraz (Barossa),"Duval used to make Grange, so it is no surprise that his current luxury Shiraz is so successful. The 2008 Eligo oozes with oaky sweetness—vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar notes—but balances that with potent cassis fruit and somehow ends on dry, savory notes of tobacco and spice. Drink now-2018, although it could surprise and go longer.",100.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
22694,Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Mythic River Sauvignon-Roditis White (Korinthia),"A blend of 50% Sauvignon Blanc and 50% Roditis, this refreshing white starts with aromas of citrus and peach, followed by crisp flavors of lemon backed by a lively acidity.

22704,Panayia 2008 Alina Medium Dry White Wine White (Cyprus),"Made from Xynisteri, a white Cypriot variety, this fresh, fruity wine is both easydrinking and food friendly.

22710,Alta Vista 2008 Classic Torrontés (Salta),"Round, melony and pleasant, with tropical/floral aromas. Flavorwise, it's all about medium-intensity melon and lychee, and as Torrontés goes this one is likable and well made. It covers the tropical fruit bases and adds in some peppery dryness on the finish.",12.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
22884,Campos de Luz 2008 Crianza Garnacha (Cariñena),"Raisiny and jammy on the bouquet, this wine becomes vital in the mouth, with fresh acidity supporting the raspberry and red plum flavors. The raisiny resurfaces on the finish, with acidic bite.",14.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
22908,Solsticio 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"A big wine that handles its 15.3% abv. Smells of pastry, earth and soft berry fruit.

22915,Greg Norman Estates 2008 Cabernet Merlot (Limestone Coast),"At only 7% Merlot, it's unclear why it's even mentioned on the label, especially since it seems to be so obviously Cabernet in style. Cassis and chocolate notes dominate this richly textured, full-bodied red. Drink now.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
22924,Nice 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",30.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477

The palate is a shade sanguine, with hints of game and plum conserve and a ripple of velvety tannins. It's developing beautifully, so drink now–2015.",35.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
23275,Estate Biblia Chora 2008 Red (Pangeon),"Fresh and versatile, this Cabernet-Merlot blend offers a balanced interplay of spice, pepper and red fruit notes.

23460,Viñas de Garza 2008 Amado IV Red (Valle de Guadalupe),"The bouquet on this blend of Cab, Zin, Merlot and Tempranillo is fairly smooth and complex, with spice and modest heat. The palate, however, seems to be on the roasted and burnt side of the fence, with chocolate notes bringing up the rear. This is tasty but heavy, grabby and hot.",58.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
23555,Dürnberg 2008 Rabenstein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This wine benefits from some time in bottle. Wood and fruit are integrated, bringing out the spice in the fruit, while leaving delicious apple and white currant fruits to blossom. Screwcap.",29.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
23760,Château Los Boldos 2008 Grand Cru Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Light mint and herbal aromas get it going, followed by dry, complex scents of tobacco, licorice, leather and blackberry. This is 80% Cabernet and 20% Merlot, and it's a bit angular on the tongue but the flavors of cassis, black cherry and plum are juicy and bold. Turns more oaky with airing, especially on the long, herbal finish.",48.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
24072,Juno 2008 Cape Maidens Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot Red (Western Cape),"A balanced, well-structured wine, and a superb value. Cassis, black plum guts and anise are supported by soft sweet spice and leather fleshing out the nose and mouth, with lingering dusty tannins leaving you begging for more. Ready to drink now; pair with flank steak fajitas.",10.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
24075,Martin's Rake 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is on the ripe side of the Sauvignon spectrum, with scents of honey and marmalade on the nose and flavors of ripe citrus, touches of stone fruit and hints of currant on the palate. It's simply fruit-driven, but satisfying nonetheless. Drink now.",14.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
24082,Lapostolle 2008 Casa Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Black cherry and cassis aromas mix with some heat, rubber and harshness on the bouquet.

24091,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Capitana Barrel Reserve Shiraz (Cachapoal Valley),"Starts out with proprietary aromas of clove, spice and cinnamon, and in the mouth it's a tannic grabber with forcefulness as well as ripe, sweet, menthol-infused berry flavors. Falls off somewhat on the finish, where butter and candy come in. Heavy and dark but still good for a New World Syrah.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
24173,Tamaya 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley),"Nearly colorless as well as crisp and racy, this SB from northerly Limarí starts with snappy lime, white grapefruit and orange aromas. Reflecting its cooler origin, it is sharp as far as acidity goes, with a short, flashy finish. A little scouring but still good.

24186,Quasar 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Hints of melon and talcum powder suggest sweetness, and the palate is ripe, a little soft and dominated by pear and even some lychee flavors. Maybe there's a hint of residual sugar, but if so, it's minor. Mild bitterness doesn't really help the finish, but overall this is a flavorful and competent value wine.",7.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
24260,Quinta do Filoco 2008 Reserva Branco White (Douro),"A lightly wood aged wine, deliciously fresh and creamy, hinting at smooth Chardonnay-like textures. A light perfume from Malvasia adds piquancy to this attractive, textured wine.",16.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477

24331,Quinta de Ventozelo 2008 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"Dominated by Touriga Nacional, this impressive and concentrated wine has a powerful structure, dark tannins, black stone fruit and layered wood.

24332,Trapiche 2008 Viña Cristina y Bibiana Coletto Single Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.",55.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
24374,Monteabellón 2008 24 Meses en Barrica  (Ribera del Duero),"Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins. This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe. Drink through 2017.",42.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
24425,Red Guitar 2008 Old Vine Tempranillo-Garnacha (Navarra),"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
24428,Graham Beck 2008 Rosé (Western Cape),"Raspberry and cherry aromas are followed by juicy raspberries and cherries and a spin of spice. The mouthfeel is crisp but the texture lush and velvety.

24555,Vega Sicilia 2008 Unico  (Ribera del Duero),"Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth.",500.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477

25381,Milcampos 2008 Viñas Viejas  (Ribera del Duero),"Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.",18.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
25392,Saints Hills 2008 Dingač Plavac Mali (Middle and South Dalmatia),"There's a distinct grassy note of hay and alfalfa on the nose of this Croatian red wine. On the palate, there are pleasant notes of ripe red fruit and chocolate, but coarse grape tannins and a bold 15.5% alcohol content contribute to a rather harsh, disjointed mouthfeel.",65.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
25510,Rio Seco 2008 Estate Bottled Torrontés (Mendoza),"Overdone aromas of candle wax, incense and air freshener show the musky side of the grape, while the palate is heavy with nectarine and citrus flavors.

25607,Domdechant Werner 2008 Hochheimer Domdechaney Erstes Gewächs Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"Pretty standard stuff, making it something of a disappointment in an Erste Gewächs context.

25920,Peter Jakob Kühn 2008 Oestrich Doosberg Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"For a 2008, this seems to be developing rather quickly, showing toasty notes that emerge on the nose, expand on the palate and jump out on the finish, largely overshadowing the admirable citrus and crushed-stone elements. Drink now.",70.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
25962,Can Blau 2008 Can Blau Red (Montsant),"Cherry and leather aromas show a stemmy, brambly element.

26037,Jorge Ordóñez & Co. 2008 Victoria 2 Moscatel (Málaga),"This opens with pure, attractive nectarine and apricot aromas, along with hints of mineral and petrol. It feels pure and racy, with delicious, clean flavors of pineapple, honey and mango. It's delicate and fresh on the finish, with just enough weight to be taken seriously.",26.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
26081,Concha y Toro 2008 Carmín de Peumo Carmenère (Peumo),"Price aside, this is a fine, ready to drink, full-bodied Carmenère with earth, cola, tree bark, cherry and cassis aromas. It's full and a touch soft in the mouth, with easy tannins and bold flavors of blackberry, herbs, bitter chocolate and leather. On the finish, it's peppery tasting and mildly herbal. Drink now through 2016.",200.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
26112,Pinhal da Torre 2008 Quinta do Alqueve Red (Tejo),"This is a powerful, dense and richly fruity wine, a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. With spice, sumptuous blackberry fruits and generous tannins, it's just reaching maturity. Offering great structure and immediate appeal, it is juicy, ripe and ready to drink.",12.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
26207,Quinta do Casal Branco 2008 Falcoaria Classico Red (Tejo),"A serious, dense wine that impresses with its elegant structure and rich fruit. The wine has an austere mineral feel that contrasts with its black-currant flavors, and its ripe, juicy character.",18.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
26328,Concha y Toro 2008 Marques de Casa Concha Syrah (Maipo Valley),"Nice aromas of cherry fruit and sweetness are perfectly clean, while the palate is slightly spunky and high in acid, with wild-berry flavors running side by side with red cherry and citrus. Has a tart, blazing side but also very good fruit character and purity",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
26408,Nieto Senetiner 2008 Don Nicanor Chardonnay-Viognier (Mendoza),"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",18.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
26617,Herdade do Esporão 2008 Esporão Private Selection Red (Alentejano),"From selected grapes, this is a powerful, complex wine. It has huge richness, tasting of the Alentejo sun. At the same time, the fruit is firm and structured, slowly revealing its fresher berry character to balance the density. The delicious juicy aftertaste promises a fine future for this wine. Drink from 2016.",60.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
26778,Agustí Torelló Mata 2008 Gran Reserva Barrica Brut Nature Macabeo (Cava),"This is superb Cava, no ifs, ands or buts. Soft, yeasty, complex aromas of bready apple and spice feed into a round, yeasty palate. Bready flavors of pear, papaya and mango end with stony minerality and a closing note of lime.",37.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
26798,Leyda 2008 Garuma Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Green aromas blend with coastal-influenced passion fruit, while the palate is driven by citrus, pineapple, passion fruit and some unfortunate canned vegetable flavors. Acidic and racy, but not much nuance or character. Shows the Leyda style of SB but not in blow-out form.",20.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
26805,Santa Rita 2008 120 Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Black cherry and leather aromas aren't complex but they're sturdy and true to the variety. So is the palate, which hits with chewy, semi-rich flavors of baked plum, cola and cocoa. Figgy but flat and short on the finish. Good value wine.",8.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
26872,Pardevalles 2008 Gamonal Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León),"This is clean on the nose, with blackberry and plum aromas. It feels full and solid, bearing flavors of black cherry and dark plum, with a meaty undertone. Mint, spice and black fruit notes carry the finish.",26.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
26884,Ferré I Catasús 2008 Terra de Fic 1 Red (Priorat),"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",45.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
26979,Bodega Rolland 2008 Val de Flores Malbec (Mendoza),"Cheesy oak is the greeting on the nose of this older Malbec from a notoriously tough vintage. After that, earthy, stewed blackberry and meaty aromas come up. This is saturated and a touch stewy, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as gamy animal notes. A dense finish tastes soupy and savory. Drink through 2018.",60.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
27014,Robertson Winery 2008 Number One Constitution Road Shiraz (Robertson),"Ripe, smooth and satiny, this wine has all the right stuff for pleasurable drinking now.

27024,Bodegas Corellanas 2008 Viña Rubican Crianza Red (Navarra),"This Navarran blend opens with spicy raspberry and red currant aromas. The palate is sharp, prickly and edgy in feel, with flavors of cherry tomato, herbs and racy red fruits. The hot, scratchy finish can probably best be tamed with food.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
27044,Dornier 2008 Donatus White White (Stellenbosch),"Surprisingly, this blend of 65% Chenin Blanc and 35% Sémillon is quite rich and oaky with prominent aromas of butter, wood-grilled red apple and walnut skin. The mouth offers more creamy nutty flavors of buttered popcorn and peach pit, but a bit lacking in the fruit department.",25.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
27431,Marqués de Legarda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Raspberry, chocolate and plum aromas form a basic bouquet. This shows tight grip along with flavors of baked berry fruits, leather and earth.

27489,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2008 Espirito Branco White (Tejo),"A light, modern, just off-dry and fruity wine, freshened by bright lime and apricots, with a tang of orange zest. This is crisp, very clean, a good apéritif drink.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
27490,Recanati 2008 Kosher Merlot (Galilee),"Jammy preserve notes of blueberry and ripe strawberry on the nose, with more plum and deep cherry notes fleshing out the medium-weight mouth. Delicate fine-grain tannins provide good structure, and linger throughout the milk chocolate-infused finish.",15.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
27491,Samos 2008 Vin Doux Muscat (Samos),"Refreshing, sultry aromas of honey, lemon and rich spice lead this sweet Muscat from Samos. On the palate, unfolding layers of honey, nuts and citrus are kept aloft by a touch of acidity. A pretty, approachable sip with an exotic flair.",16.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
27588,Palacios Remondo 2008 Propiedad  (Rioja),"This wine is raisiny on the front end, heavy and prune-driven in the middle, and even more raisiny on the finish. Overripe in style with 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",45.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
27978,Whitehaven 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Winemaker Simon Waghorn has been able to maintain this brand's quality even as production has ramped up to 100,000 cases, a remarkable feat. The 2008 features ripe, tropical fruit aromas of guava and pineapple that morph easily into flavors of nectarine and fig; expect some herbal notes to emerge by the time it reaches consumers. It's plump in the mouth, yet finishes with a mouthwatering, clean, crisp finish.",23.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
28056,Barão de Vilar 2008 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"Solid and firm, it has powerful tannins and no sense yet of aging. The concentration is palpable, offering impressive weight while also bringing out ripe berry fruits. It needs until 2017–2018 to soften.",60.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
28167,Greek Wine Cellars 2008 Assyrtico (Santorini),This is a softer style Agiorgitiko with elegant citrus aromas and flavors and a touch of flowers in the palate. Easydrinking and refreshing with a food-oriented crispness.,13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
28182,Chilensis 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Lactic and creamy smelling, with a muddled, green edge that never really settles. The palate is tannic and mildly green, with herbal olive and berry flavors. And the finish is basically more of the same. Standard base-level Carmenère.",12.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
28183,Cicchitti 2008 Primmo Red (Mendoza),"Dark, gummy and full of heavily applied green oak, this wine has a candied, murky, resiny persona. And that's too bad, because it has potential; yet the tannins, wood resin, mesquite and beefy black fruit are all too dominant and thus it never settles or shows much harmony.",12.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
28336,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2008 Monte de Peceguina Branco White (Alentejano),"A creamy, Chardonnay-like wine that is rich, open and generous. It has weight but keeps a sense of proportion with its balancing texture of fruit skins and herbs.",20.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
28359,Dehesas y Viñedos de Navamarín 2008 Aldonza Navamarín Limited Edition Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Tree bark, rubber and berry aromas get this blend going. The palate shows piquant, zesty acidity, which pumps up dry, herbal, tangy flavors of red-berry fruits. On the finish, it's all about rubber, pepper, herbs and tomato, all wrapped in zesty acidity.",59.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
28378,Santa Rita 2008 Pehuén Carmenère (Apalta),"With cool, herbal aromas of cola, pine, juniper, fine oak and savory berry fruits, this is a fine Carmenère. The palate is full, deep and still fresh after several years in the bottle. Flavors of stewed cherry, baked plum and cassis come with no shortage of savory support, while the finish is saucy in taste, with raciness, gravitas and length. Drink through 2018.",70.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
28432,Raats Family 2008 Original Unwooded Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region),"Melon, pineapple and apple aromas followed by a balanced, elegant combination of pineapple, melon and citrus flavors give this Chenin a fresh, zesty appeal. A lingering finish completes the package.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
28555,Vins d'Orrance 2008 Cuvée Ameena Syrah (Western Cape),"The 14 months spent in oak lend this wine an earthy, sweet-spice-driven character that infuses the red cherry and currant aromas and flavors. The wood also contributes to the lush mouthfeel and smoky finish. But although it's oaky, it's not overwhelming, and the wine ultimately comes across as balanced and clean.",39.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
28558,Quinta do Quetzal 2008 Reserva Red (Alentejo),"A big wine in every sense, dark in color, the fruit supremely rich without being excessive. It is very structured within its opulent framework. Likely to age well, this is concentrated, dense.",45.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
28562,Herdade dos Grous 2008 Reserva Red (Alentejano),"Fermented in open lagars, this wine is luscious with wonderful depth of black fruit flavor, spice and acidity. It has hints of wood, although these are already well integrated into the ripe fruit. Age this wine for at least 3–4 years.",54.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
28573,Teso La Monja 2008 Alabaster  (Toro),"A dark bruiser with heavy mocha, chocolate, tobacco, cola and crusty leather aromas in addition to massive fruit scents. It's huge in the mouth, with broad, grabby tannins, pumped-up acids and wide berry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Dark like coffee on the finish, with titanic tannins and foundation. Best from 2013 through 2016.",243.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
28785,Umathum 2008 Joiser Kirschgarten Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"A brooding wine, this shows all the aging potential of Blaufränkisch. Using grapes sourced from the Kirschgarten Vineyard, this has tar and violet aromas, plus firm, dry tannins and a dense yet juicy black-fruit character. It could still age over 4–5 years. Glass stopper.",70.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
29072,Basico 2008 Blanco Sauvignon Blanc (La Mancha),"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29079,Agros 2008 Katerina Assyrtico (Santorini),"This wine balances fresh fruit, citrus and tropical fruit with a crisp minerality. The wine offers freshness as well as spiciness and a touch of curve. Pair with sautéed fish, salads.",20.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29080,Basico 2008 Rojo Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (La Mancha),"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29088,Pago del Vostal 2008 Tinto  (Ribera del Duero),"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29206,Espiritu de Argentina 2008 Bonarda (Mendoza),"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill.",9.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
29208,Fleur Du Cap 2008 Bergkelder Selection Merlot (Coastal Region),"This is classic Merlot at a great price, with notes of black plum, cherry, blackberry and licorice on the nose and mouth.

29227,Plaisir De Merle 2008 Merlot (Paarl),"Jammy black fruit and berry notes lead the way on this Merlot, with supporting notes of tree bark and black tea. The medium-full mouth offers more juicy dark fruit flavors and dusty tannins that linger through the close. Drink now.",28.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
29526,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2008 Sauvignon Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland),"The warm Burgenland climate has produced a Sauvignon Blanc that goes for the yellow fruits and richness. But there is also a good, crisp lemon streak that brightens the whole wine. For drinking this summer. Screwcap.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
29535,Agustinos 2008 Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Cola, rubber, cool blackberry and spice make for a good set of aromas, while the palate is tight and drawing, with tannic bite to go with bawdy black fruit flavors that veer toward roasted. Finishes with length along with coffee and olive flavors. A little astringent but good wine.",14.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
29565,Fernández de Piérola 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Savory berry aromas are accompanied by spice notes and a hint of latex. This feels wide rather than precisely shaped. Baked, earthy, oaky flavors envelop stewed berry notes, and the wine feels wayward on the finish.",24.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
29805,Benegas 2008 Libertad Vineyards Syrah (Mendoza),"Like many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.",25.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29809,Castillo de Monjardin 2008 Tintico Tempranillo (Navarra),"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",7.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29810,Cueto 2008 Selección  (Rioja),"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",17.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29813,Lusco 2008 Zios de Lusco Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",19.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
29849,Hollen Family Vineyards 2008 Don Giaroli Syrah (Mendoza),"Baked, earthy, reedy aromas yield to a narrow, tannic, awkward body. Sweet, green flavors are candied and flat. Time has passed this by.",14.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
30008,Dão Sul 2008 Quinta das Tecedeiras Reserva Red (Douro),"A big, ripe earthy wine, layered with tannins and dark black fruits. It has density and concentration, while keeping a sense of freshness and balance. A powerful and impressive wine that will age well.",30.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
30045,Wyndham Estate 2008 George Wyndham Founder's Reserve Shiraz (Langhorne Creek),"This wine represents an excellent value, and one that showcases the quality potential of Langhorne Creek. It's creamy in texture, voluptuous in feel and full in body, with a bold flavor of red currant that's framed by ample cedar and vanilla notes. Long and creamy on the finish. Drink now–2018.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
30059,Balgownie Estate 2008 Shiraz (Bendigo),"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a lush, velvety Shiraz that nevertheless seems to possess enough structure to age successfully. Cassis, molasses and vanilla all play roles in the aroma and flavor profiles, while a mocha note chimes in on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",25.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
30063,Plantagenet 2008 Shiraz (Mount Barker),"All three of Plantagenet's Shirazes were successful in 2008. This, the flagship bottling, offers aromas of coffee grounds, cherry and cracked black pepper, adding vanilla, spice and charred beef flavors on the palate. It's harmonious, savory and complex. Drink now–2020 and possibly beyond.",29.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
30254,Vega Murillo 2008  Toro,"Roasted, herbal and blunt, with an acrid stemminess. The palate lacks ripeness and elegance as it delivers burnt, leafy, herbal flavors. Underwhelming.",13.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
30265,Emmerich Knoll 2008 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is one of the great Rieslings from the Wachau, a wonderful panoply of ripe, tropical fruit, pierced with flint, spice and minerality. It is rich and opulent, while never losing sight of the core tautness of a fine Riesling.",70.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477
30478,Château Los Boldos 2008 Amalia Red (Cachapoal Valley),"An odd mix of Graham cracker, blueberry jam and floral aromas yield a kitchen cleanser whole. With time things get better, yielding a big, sticky palate of blueberry, blackberry and syrupy flavors. A grapey big boy with a cloying finish. Good but not balanced quite right.",50.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
30480,Lirica 2008 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),"Earthy on the nose with aromas of sun-dried hay, foliage and a high toned black cherry note. Significant aeration softens grassy aromas to reveal a red berry palate marked with bright acidity, but the finish is aggressive with rough, gripping tannins.",16.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30535,Doña Paula 2008 Los Cardos Syrah (Mendoza),"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30537,Ku Dé Ta 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Respectable red fruit aromas carry a slight pickled sharpness and the scent of a matchstick, while the palate is lactic and creamy, with strawberry, raspberry, plum and herbal notes. Plump and reasonably well balanced, with an herbal finish.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30540,Callia 2008 Alta Pinot Grigio (Tulum Valley),"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30546,Tamar Ridge 2008 Devil's Corner Riesling (Tasmania),"This Riesling starts out strong, with a likable tangle of apricots, peaches and apples on the nose. The palate is a bit watery, though it offers up some nice flavors of lime rind and pomelo. Short finish. Drink soon, preferably with cold roast pork.",16.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30548,Alamos 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Slightly astringent on the nose, with floral berry and bramble aromas. The palate is tight and a little sharp, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and plum flavors. Cleansing on the finish due to high acidity. Seems more racy and less oaky than in the past.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30550,Argento 2008 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.",16.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
30726,Llopart 2008 Rosé Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
30764,Achaval-Ferrer 2008 Finca Mirador Malbec (Mendoza),"This single-vineyard Malbec proves once again that Achaval-Ferrer does not specialize in textbook wines. It's a terroir-driven hard-body with tight blueberry and cherry aromas and flavors. There's a lot of zest, drive and crispness to the palate, and the finish is tight, layered and long. Drinkable now through 2018.",120.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
30870,Telavi 2008 Marani Kondoli Vineyards Rkatsiteli (Kakheti),"Smoky on the nose, with hints of waxy orange rind and honey comb, this oak-aged Rkatsiteli is dry and crisp. It's also on the light side, with a smoky, dusty palate.",14.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
31131,Federico Paternina 2008 Clisos Crianza  (Rioja),"This smells like fresh pavement at first, with gritty black-fruit and burnt leaf notes. The palate feels edgy, with a spotty red-fruit flavor that's matched with notes of resiny oak and vanilla. It finishes in a similar fashion.

31173,Tegernseerhof 2008 Terrassen Riesling (Wachau),"Terrassen wines are blends from vineyards across the lower slopes of the Wachau hills: the easy-drinking side of the region.

31182,Pewsey Vale 2008 Individual Vineyard Selection Dry Riesling (Eden Valley),"Hints of honey, citrus and petrol mark the aromas of this wine from a legendary Eden Valley estate. It's a medium-bodied rendition of Riesling, dry and petrolly, with a long, concentrated finish that suggests that this wine could safely be cellared for up to 10 years.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
31248,Fundatio 2008 Selección Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",9.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
31249,Francesc Sanchez Bas 2008 Blanc de Montsalvat White (Priorat),"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",40.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
31324,Konzelmann 2008 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Niagara Peninsula),"Smoky and dark with hints of petrol and potpourri, this full-bodied late-harvest Gewürz  has a pleasantly off-dry, honeyed palate, but suffers from some tired, dusty notes and a burnt caramel finish.",18.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
31388,Masi Tupungato 2008 Paso Doble Malbec-Corvina Red (Tupungato),"Deep and sultry aromas of black fruit, mineral and toast mix with licorice gum drop and leather to form a good bouquet. The palate, however, runs more sharp than expected, with high acidity propelling lean, narrow pie-cherry flavors. A bit hollow but fresh and pure. Starts better than it ends. 70% Malbec and 30% Corvina.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
31466,Pulenta Estate 2008 Gran Cabernet Franc (Luján de Cuyo),"Smells volatile and balsamic, much like salad dressing. There's no doubting this wine is Cab Franc—it's herbal and foresty, with a soft mouthfeel and herbal berry flavors topped off by oregano and basil. A rustic wine that's probably too herbal for most palates.",40.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
31606,Yalumba 2008 Hand Picked Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),"A consistent performer, Yalumba's Hand Picked Shiraz-Viognier seems slightly bigger and chunkier in 2008 than in the past, with bold fruit—blueberries and blackberries—accented by hints of mint. Expect some savory notes to develop over the next couple of years in bottle.",31.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
31764,Dos Victorias 2008 2V Premium  (Toro),"Roasted meat, leather, animal and stout berry aromas make for an inviting bouquet. Like most serious Toro wines, this is hard but fresh and layered, with lively black-fruit flavors that darken under the control of oaky spice. Tobacco, menthol and mint ring loudly on the finish. Drink now–2018; 200 cases made.",143.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
32097,Hans Igler 2008 Ab Ericio Red (Burgenland),"Blaufränkisch dominates this blend with Merlot and Zweigelt. This flagship wine from the Igler winery is powered by its perfumed fruit, cherry and red berry flavors, ripe and juicy at the same time. There is no question of the ageability of this concentrated, complex wine.",62.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
32159,Greenstone 2008 Shiraz (Heathcote),"This medium-weight Shiraz features subtle campfire notes from start to finish, underscoring its cherry and mint aromas and flavors. Fresh and friendly, it features a soft dusting of tannins on the finish. Drink it now and over the next few years.",40.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
32175,Bodegas Breton 2008 Loriñon Crianza  (Rioja),"Floral and lightly earthy on the nose, with a touch of latex. Feels fresh and pure, with fine acidity pressing bright flavors of red cherry and raspberry. Gets toastier and darker on the finish, ending with spice and clarity.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
32215,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2008 Grande Escolha Alfrocheiro (Tejo),"The spice and juicy fruit give the wine its intense strawberry flavor. To balance its fruit, the tannins lend a firm background structure. The wine has just the right weight, and its soft aftertaste, it's ready to drink now.",38.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
32369,Undurraga 2008 Sibaris Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Ultra-fresh and snappy, but a little light and neutral when it comes to fruit character. The palate is totally spunky and alive, with bouncy but mild flavors of lime, white grapefruit and orange. Clean and likable, with good focus but only medium-level intensity and power. Drink now.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
32379,Santa Rita 2008 Medalla Real Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"From cool-climate Leyda along the coastline, this SB is fairly grassy and green. The nose shows hints of green bean and peas, while the flavor profile rotates around a mix of honeydew melon and pea pod. Good mouthfeel and finishing persistence are positives; but in the final analysis it seems a little vegetal.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
32380,Santa Rita 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Clean and composed SB, with lemon-lime aromas that settle more toward lime. The palate is clean, with basic depth that allows for nice green apple and dry green-herb flavors to show themselves. A little weak on the back end, and very “liquid” due to medium concentration.",12.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
32389,Sebeka 2008 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"This wine starts with an attractive nose of melons and lemons, followed by bright and exuberant melon and fruit flavors. Balanced with curvy midpalate weight and a clean but exotic finish, it's a fun wine that offers complexity with charm.",10.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
32390,Simone 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Crisp and sturdy at this young stage, with a lot of green on the nose: apple, onion, melon, even celery. For a Maule Valley SB, this one manages to maintain freshness and liveliness. There's give and take between the wine's acidity and body, with apple, green herb and talc for flavors. Finishes clean and chalky.",12.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
32952,Quinta Dona Matilde 2008 Colheita  (Port),"This is obviously a young Colheita aged in wood for just eight years. That puts it close to a Late Bottled Vintage and takes it away from a tawny style. It is a fine wine with dried fruits and acidity in balance, just not quite a mature Colheita. Drink now.",40.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
33062,Kilikanoon 2008 Covenant Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This plush, fruit-driven style of Shiraz displays aromas that resemble a cross between Nilla Wafers and graham crackers spread with berry preserves. The flavors follow along similar lines, underscored by hints of chocolate and coffee on the lingering finish.",40.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
33064,Rocland Estate 2008 Lot 147 Single Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"This full-bodied Shiraz starts off plummy, with oak-derived accents of smoke and vanilla. Those elements also show up on the palate, picking up additional notes of blackberry, cedar and baking spice. The texture is velvety, and the finish is long and surprisingly elegant. Drink now–2025.",30.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
33072,Wild Duck Creek Estate 2008 Yellow Hammer Hill Shiraz-Malbec (Heathcote),"Although this probably won't be easy to locate (only 64 of the 550 cases produced were imported to the U.S.), it is worth seeking out for its full, expansive mouthfeel; intense cassis and dark chocolate flavors; and long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025.",25.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
33088,Drassanes 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Valencia),"The nose on this Syrah-Cabernet combination is defined almost entirely by raisin and prune. The wine feels heavy and raisiny rich on the palate, with one-dimensional flavors of raisin and prune (just like the bouquet indicates). Lastly, the finish tastes brandied.",22.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
33099,Taltarni 2008 Taché Sparkling (South Eastern Australia),"A faint coppery-pink rosé, Taltarni's 2008 Taché is a blend of 58% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 5% Pinot Meunier. It's lean and crisp, with a zesty, citrusy feel to the modest toast and mushroom flavors.",25.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
33219,Bodega Classica 2008 Hacienda Lopez de Haro Reserva  (Rioja),"Although a touch rough and stalky on the nose, any and all gritty aromas are offset by earthy, mature cherry and plum scents. Grabby but fair on the palate, this tastes of roasted plum, herbs and peppery spice. A dry, toasty finish with spice notes ranks as good.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
33386,Schloss Gobelsburg 2008 Heiligenstein Riesling (Kamptal),"Lovers of the purest mineral Riesling, very steely, will go crazy for this wine. It is tightly woven around a core of green and white fruits and the crispest, knife-edge sharp acidity. It is for aging, to produce a stunning wine in 4–5 years at a minimum.",54.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
33888,Pargua 2008 Anka Red (Maipo Valley),"This is an interesting six-grape blend that's not like most other Chilean specimens. It starts with a leathery note as well as eucalyptus, licorice and lightly minty fruit aromas. It feels cheeky and tannic but mature, with baked berry, raisin and chocolate flavors. Dark, spicy and chocolaty until the last remnants of the finish conclude; this needs lots of air to show its best.",22.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
34064,Raumland 2008 Cuvée Katharina Brut Sparkling (Germany),"Extended lees ageing lends rich brioche and caramel notes to this delicately floral sparkling wine. On the palate, tangerine pith and fresh apple meld in a soft, creamy foam, finishing long, with a lingering yeastiness and sharp line of lemon-lime acidity.",40.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
34139,MontGras 2008 Quatro Red (Colchagua Valley),"One of the best values in Chilean wine is Quatro, a lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah. The nose is deep and roasted, with aromas of bacon, vanilla, pastry and black fruit. Lush and full in the mouth, with intense blackberry and cassis flavors. A titan at a great price, and ageable over the short term. Drink now through 2013.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
34732,Bodegas Vidal Soblechero 2008 Viña Clavidor Verdejo (Rueda),"Neutral aromas of citrus and almond skin precede a jumpy, fresh and spritzy palate of green apple and citrus flavors. Tight, crisp, food-friendly white wine with cut and zest. Comfortably fits the Rueda/Verdejo model.",14.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
34740,Quo 2008 Grenache (Campo de Borja),"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
34744,Almira 2008 Los Dos Old Vines Grenache-Syrah (Campo de Borja),"Nice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent. Mildly medicinal on the finish but overall it offers good power, structure and concentration.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
35292,Viu Manent 2008 Secreto Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Quite charred and hard, which is something I can't remember in tasting VM's wines for the past decade. It's also plummy and thick, with a flat palate that doesn't register on the mouthfeel meter. Flavors of black fruits are lemony from the oak and generic, while the finish is round and basic.",14.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
35303,Heritage 2008 Rosé d'Une Nuit Rosé (Bekaa Valley),"A blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah, this salmon-colored rosé from Lebanon is dominated both on the nose and palate by a green, herbaceous oak character. It's a dry, medium-bodied wine with faint and dusty strawberry and raspberry flavors in the backdrop, but overall, a disjointed, clumsy sip.",15.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
35305,Dreamer 2008 Late Harvest Riesling (Dealurile Munteniei),"There's a vegetal, tinned nature to this late harvest Riesling from Romania that dominates both the nose and the palate. Honeyed apple and pear flavors peek through the off-dry palate, but overall, it's a disjointed, tired wine with bracingly high acidity.",9.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
35343,D'Arenberg 2008 The Footbolt Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Full bodied, lush and slightly liquorous in style, the 2008 Footbolt is also packed with peppery, slightly herbal blackberry fruit. There's also a hint of menthol. Drink it over the next 12 months.",19.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
35390,Telavi 2008 Marani Mukuzani Saperavi (Kakheti),"Smooth and supple, with loads of juicy, ripe blackberry and plum flavors, this full-bodied, luscious red is another great bang-for-your-buck Georgian offering. Big, bold tannins persist on the palate that's laced with tasty, lingering notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Perfect with winter braises and stews.",14.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
35643,Wachter Wiesler 2008 Steinweg Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"Aged in 500-liter barrels, this wine has a very mineral character, packed with spice, juicy red berry fruits, and underlying dryness. For drinking now and over the next two years.",69.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
35663,Dominio de Eguren 2008 Protocolo Rosado Rosé (Tierra de Castilla),"Fresh and clean for the most part, with light raspberry and strawberry aromas. It's a little cloying on the palate, but the flavors of citrus and melon, while briney, are lasting and move in the right direction. A good buy made from the obscure Bobal variety and Tempranillo.",7.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
35673,Monte Largo 2008 White (Estremadura),"An attractive, simple wine, with the freshest of citrus and melon flavors, pushed through by crisp acidity and a final hint of almonds. Screwcap.",8.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477

35752,Quinta de la Rosa 2008 Colheita  (Port),"Still young in color and fruit, this is packed with black fruits and only the lightest hints of wood aging. That makes the wine very different from other vintage Colheitas or aged tawnies, with a style that is ripe and still fresh.",35.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
35807,Château Musar 2008 Jeune Red Red (Bekaa Valley),"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well.",20.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
35895,Royal Tokaji 2008 Mád Cuvée Late Harvest  (Tokaji),"Bursting with zesty tangerine peel aromas and a gentle clover honey sweetness, the Mád Cuvée Late Harvest reflects a lighter style of Tokaji, but with a freshness and delicacy that's ethereal.",21.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
35908,Trapiche 2008 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza),"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",12.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
35914,Thatched Hut 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",19.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
36002,Mauro 2008 VS Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Given how cool and difficult the 2008 vintage was, this is impressive. Bold, oaky aromas of coconut, cola and mocha come with a blackberry backing. Vibrancy and hard tannins push the palate, which brings chocolaty flavors, spice and mocha along with core berry. Licorice, toast and other black flavors drive an oaky, hard finish. Drink through 2021.",100.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
36135,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Aguia Moura Em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),"A powerful and concentrated wine, this shows the region's dark and tannic side.

36155,Oxford Landing 2008 GSM Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (South Australia),"This blend of 45% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 27% Mourvèdre does show a trace of heat in its finish, but is otherwise a pleasant, medium-bodied sipper at a realistic price. Tart, slightly minty cherries feature undercurrents of chocolate and coffee, turning crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
36557,Sauvignon Republic 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Like many top Marlborough Sauvignons, this wine has a leafy, herbal component backed by copious fruit. In this case, the wine delivers touches of nectarine and pineapple, along with a bit of chili pepper. It's medium-bodied, with a long, mouth-watering finish.",19.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
36846,Numanthia 2008 Termes  (Toro),"An excellent wine for an off vintage, with licorice, balsam, black fruit galore and coconut aromas. The feel is plush, layered and smooth for Toro, with blackberry, mocha, lemon peel and coconutty flavors. Toasty on the finish, with a final wave of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now through 2014.",30.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
36866,Kracher 2008 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 2 Trockenbeerenauslese Welschriesling (Burgenland),"Smooth and unctuous wine, rich with an oily texture that coats the mouth with its honey, mango and treacle character. It is so concentrated, just the essence of sweetness. Acidity is there in the final tang of lemon zest.",75.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
36886,Meli 2008 Carignan (Maule Valley),"Olive, herbs and baked berry aromas vie with slightly stemmy scents to create a good but compromised bouquet.

36890,Lammershoek 2008 Roulette Blanc White (Swartland),"A blend of 48% Chenin Blanc, 41% Chardonnay and 11% Viognier, this is an interesting white with slightly oxidized but rich notes of honeycomb, toasted hazelnut and baked apple thoughout. Medium weight with a touch of heat coming through on the long finish.",25.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
37164,Rincón de Guadalupe 2008 Brisas del Sur Red (San Vicente),"Sweet, earthy and dry smelling, with tobacco and savory soy aromas.

37547,Morandé 2008 Gran Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Big, oaky and roasted up front, with charred aromas. The palate is full but clacky, with piercing acidity leading to a saucy, sharp set of tangy red berry and herb flavors.

37612,Caligiore 2008 Grazioso Torrontés (Mendoza),"Peachy aromas are friendly, while the palate has a good feel to it along with green flavors of melon, lime and fresh veggies.

37648,CARM 2008 Quinta do Côa Red (Douro),"The Côa valley is at the remote eastern end of the Douro. The wine revels in its firm, mineral, structured character, with acidity, spice and a dry center. There is weight, richness and the potential for aging.",25.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477

37685,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,450.0,100,6,0.9960939822705477

38301,Gentilini 2008 Aspro Classic White (Cephalonia),"Fresh, fruity and flirty, this white offers vanilla, fresh fruit and minerals on the nose and on the palate, a lovely balance of citrus, spice and flowers. Vibrant and layered, with a minerally, cheerful finish.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
38304,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2008 White (Beiras),"Made from Cerceal, this is a delicious wine, lifted by some wood flavors giving a creamed baked apple flavor, with white currants and a final, refreshing burst of citrus.",36.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
38319,Borsao 2008 Monte Oton Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"On the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build. Whole, concentrated and shows good structure, depth and character. About as good as inexpensive Garnacha gets.",7.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
38329,Lagarde 2008 Reserva Viognier (Mendoza),"A hint of orange escapes from an otherwise acrid, oily nose, while the flavors of nectarine, peach and lychee are pithy and bitter. Can't offer a whole lot of positives about this weird Viognier.",15.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
38339,Zolo 2008 Viognier (Mendoza),"Generic, mealy, bland and flat banana aromas and flavors. Not so bad that you can't drink it but impossible to get excited about.",12.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
38340,Viña Cantosán 2008 Verdejo (Rueda),"Dusty, flat and about half oxidized, this is a bland version of Verdejo that isn't unpalatable but lags behind the field. Hits with a thud; very little life to it.",9.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
38476,Clarendon Hills 2008 Piggot Range Syrah (Clarendon),"This is a potent, rich Shiraz. It's full bodied and thickly textured, with aromas and flavors of mocha, asphalt and plum.

38480,Kilikanoon 2008 Oracle Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This wine starts off with notes of blackberry, mint and asphalt on the nose, unfurling on the tongue to reveal tar, black olive, meat and blackberry flavors.

39086,Bodega Patritti 2008 Primogénito Blend Red (Patagonia),"Wiry aromas of red plum and cherry are offset by deeper, more baked and stewy notes. This drills away with hard tannins and punchy acidity, while cherry, plum, mint and earthy flavors finish with baked, chocolaty power. The blend is 40% each of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, with 20% Merlot.",29.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
39261,Viñamada 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Cedary, leafy, dry aromas of cherry and lemon peel filter into a sinewy, oaky palate with cherry, plum and vanilla flavors.

39282,Josef Pöckl 2008 Rosso e Nero Red (Burgenland),"A blend of Blaufränkisch, Zweigelt, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, created as a fusion of international and Austrian varieties, this dry-textured, firm wine is rich and full-bodied with plum skins and concentration.

39289,Juan Carlos Sancha 2008 Ad Libitum  (Rioja),"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.",40.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
39296,Ardales 2008 Organic Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,16.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
39307,Bressia 2008 Monteagrelo Syrah (Mendoza),"This opens with red fruit aromas that are wrapped around earth and leather scents, yielding a rustic whole.

40295,Viña Vilano 2008 Rosado Tempranillo (Ribera del Duero),"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing.

40783,Gaba do Xil 2008 Godello (Valdeorras),"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477

41021,D'Arenberg 2008 The Dead Arm Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Concentrated and intense, this wine features a potent whack of oak on the nose, with dark fruit and mocha overtones. There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.",65.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
41297,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón 2008 Viña Alarba Old Vines Grenache (Calatayud),"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
41366,Lyrarakis 2008 Symbolo Grand Cuvée Red (Crete),"Plum and red berry aromas start this integrated red blend, which is released only in the best years.

41489,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",18.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
41490,Casa Silva 2008 Los Lingues Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Stocky, wild and needing to breathe, this is one foxy, jumpy wine with olive, herbal and animal aromas. It's requisitely big and jammy, with mocha and maple flavors accenting dark, driving berry fruit. Pours on the chocolate, oak and power as it unrolls.",22.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
41627,Vistalba 2008 Corte A Red (Mendoza),"Beefy black-fruit aromas are inviting for their accents of licorice, coconut and crushed minerals.

41669,Tamaya 2008 Reserva Syrah (Limarí Valley),"Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs. But it's also strange and not fully in gear. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",14.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
41670,Falernia 2008 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),"Dusty apple, pear and other dry-fruit aromas give this clean wine a good but basic starting point. The palate is fresh but exceedingly simple in terms of its apple, kiwi and nectarine flavors. Pithy and bitter on the finish, but fresh. Tastes and smells like a standard white Rioja.",9.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
41738,Vecordia 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Only 400 cases of this top-level crianza were made, and it smells rich and good, with notes of ripe berry and plum and a mild syrupy note.

41759,Viu Manent 2008 Botrytis Selection Noble Sémillon (Colchagua Valley),"Peachy and a little sharp on the nose, but the palate is smooth and glides along nicely, and the flavors of citrus, honey and caramel are good and hold form through the finish.

41760,Bleasdale 2008 Langhorne Crossing Red (Langhorne Creek),"Impressively silky for the price, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (53%), Shiraz (35%), Petit Verdot (7%) and Malbec (5%) is a bargain that should be easy enough to find, with 10,000 cases imported.

41860,Quinta do Portal 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"A powerful wine, certainly, although in the elegant style of Quinta do Portal. Big black berry and plum flavors wrap around tannins that are still young, exuberant, needing time to settle down. The acidity and the solid tannic structure suggest good aging.",28.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
42273,Zull 2008 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Classically perfumed Riesling, very floral, with white flower aromas and a star fruit and kiwi flavors.

42285,Four Sisters 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia),"New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is the leading imported wine in Australia, which has led domestic wineries to redouble their efforts at the variety. This bargain-priced example features fig and citrus notes underscored by a slight herbaceousness, even some red currant flavors. It's round in the mouth without being overly broad, ending with mouthwatering citrus flavors. Drink now.",13.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477

42694,Caves Primavera 2008 Primavera Reserva Red (Bairrada),"Big, ripe and spicy, with tobacco and herbal flavors alongside the black currant intensity and powerful acidity. It is rich while the austere tannins of the Baga grape are still young. Keep for 2–3 years.",7.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
42740,La Conreria d'Scala Dei 2008 Iugiter Red (Priorat),"Iugiter delivers berry, cola and licorice aromas in front of a racy, acid-rich palate that's linear in shape.

42788,Jorge Ordóñez & Co. 2008 Selección Especial 1 Moscatel (Málaga),"This is friendly on the nose with a melon scent. It feels fresh and not too challenging on palate, with nectarine, peach and mango flavors. The finish isn't too firm, but it doesn't fall apart.

42891,Montecillo 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy rooty aromas of aged dry berry fruits and tobacco are scratchy while hinting at complexity. In the mouth, this Gran Reserva is drawing and tight.

43421,Brokenwood 2008 Oakey Creek Semillon (Hunter Valley),"Tasting young Hunter Semillons is fraught with peril, as often the wines that taste shrillest when young blossom nicely with age.

43922,Coto de Hayas 2008 Tinto Red (Campo de Borja),"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors.

44047,Dürnberg 2008 Rabenstein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This wine benefits from some time in bottle. Wood and fruit are integrated, bringing out the spice in the fruit, while leaving delicious apple and white currant fruits to blossom. Screwcap.",29.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
44118,Clarendon Hills 2008 Romas Grenache (Clarendon),"Full-bodied and lush in style, with aromas of cherries and spice.

44226,Artadi 2008 Viñas de Gain  (Rioja),"Tight and edgy but ultimately oaky and generous on the nose, with earth, vanilla, dried cheese and blackberry notes. Feels cushioned and complete, with depth of feel and flavor; tastes of deep berry, mild herbs and finally a toasty wave of coffee and chocolate takes over. Impressive for a 2008; drink now through 2014.",30.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
44381,Lagosta 2008 White (Vinho Verde),"A sweet, soft, clean wine, anonymous almost. Yes, there is freshness, lightness, but all the time the awkward, unbalancing sweetness pulls it down. Drink very chilled.",5.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477

44574,Fire Block 2008 Watervale Dry Riesling (Clare Valley),"Straightforward apple and lime aromatics bust from the glass alongside some slightly smoky, struck-flint notes, but this wine offers rather simple fruit flavors on the palate, It's medium bodied, with a hint of honey already creeping in on the finish, suggesting early consumption is warranted.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
44576,Graham Beck 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Cape),"Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now. Menthol, blackberries, cassis and leathery spice fill the nose and mouth, with moderate weight and a medium finish. A nice choice for grilled or herb-crusted lamb chops.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
44581,Penfolds 2008 Thomas Hyland Riesling (Adelaide),"Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group. A user-friendly introduction to Australian Riesling that should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
44613,Mount Nelson 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"It seems this Italian venture is starting to hit its stride, turning in a plump, round offering layered with complexity. It starts off sweaty and pungent, then develops more melon and nectarine scents with aeration. Those flavors follow through on the palate, followed by persistent notes of white grapefruit on the finish.",17.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
44745,Montalvo Wilmot 2008 Finca Los Cerrillos Roble Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Scratchy red-berry aromas are herbal but not fully green.

44817,Croft 2008 Quinta da Roêda Vintage  (Port),"An attractive, fruity wine, very pure in character, with some minerality along with dry tannins. The wine does keep a little sweetness, but remains on the dry side.",58.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
44831,Carta Vieja 2008 Clásico Sauvignon Blanc (Loncomilla Valley),"Reasonably nice peach, melon and apple flavors are nothing extraordinary, but together they make for a decent nose. The palate is soft but not what you'd call flabby, while flavors of pear, apple and banana are innocuous and shouldn't send anyone running to the door. For best results, drinknow.",7.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
44832,Carta Vieja 2008 Single Vineyard Limited Release Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Loncomilla Valley),"Can't really say there's much difference between this and Carta Vieja's Classico SB. Both are bland, with chunky apple and pear characteristics. Neither has much of a pulse, but on the plus side they aren't nasty or aggressive. This “limited release” turns out to be a basic wine for basicoccasions.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
45036,O. Fournier 2008 Alfa Spiga  (Ribera del Duero),"Ripe blackberry, graphite and tobacco aromas become oakier with airing, making resin, vanilla and mocha notes rise up. The wine is lush and weighty in the mouth, with loamy, baked flavors of black fruits, raisin, herbs and chocolate. A smooth, textured finish is home to licorice and sweet berry flavors. Drink now through 2017.",45.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
45078,Cielo y Tierra 2008 Celador Malbec (Mendoza),"Reedy and minty in smell, this has a green aroma that shares the stage with cassis and plum notes. It feels gritty and choppy, with rustic flavors of burnt leaf, roasted berry and herb. The finish is short on flavor and high on heat.",22.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
45080,Raiza 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"At first this is lactic and heavy, but later it becomes charred and toasty. Its feel is full, round and fairly smooth, with baked plum, berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and solid. Good for a 50,000-case production.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
45245,El Coto 2008 Coto de Imaz Reserva  (Rioja),"Raspberry and plum aromas are fresh with a hint of sharpness. This defines zesty and crisp; the acidity level is high, which is common for 2008s, but there's enough body and power to support red-berry and vanilla flavors. A cleansing, fresh finish closes things out.",24.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
45332,Mont-Ferrant 2008 Berta Bouzy Extra Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Fresh apple, lime and minerally aromas come with leesy complexity and bread notes.

45565,Viña Bisquertt 2008 La Joya Reserve Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Big and tarry, with asphalt and black fruit galore on the nose.

45567,Arboleda 2008 Merlot (Aconcagua Valley),"Dark and charred, with black cherry, black licorice and a burnt-oak element on the nose. The palate is thick and firm, with dark berry, herbal notes and some additional burnt char. Finishes with herbal flavors, olive notes and carob. An obvious Chilean Merlot; comes straight from central casting.",19.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
45569,Concha y Toro 2008 Xplorador Carmenère (Central Valley),"Rich and concentrated for an entry-level wine, with earthy, bold aromas and a lush, well-balanced palate feel. Deep and sweet in terms of flavor, with a mix of ripe black fruits and herbs. Shows a bit of faux oak flavor on a mocha-tinged finish. Exemplary for this price range.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
45724,Graffigna 2008 Centenario Pinot Grigio (San Juan),"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately.",13.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
45725,Alberti 154 2008 Syrah (Mendoza),"Opens with thin fruit and alcoholic burn, and while the wine is always hollow in its middle and basic, it does offer adequate plum, raspberry and peppery flavors. Toasty and bitter on the finish, with an o.k. mouthfeel.",13.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
45739,MAN Vintners 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Coastal Region),"This is a robust Sauvignon Blanc that announces itself with aromas of grass, spice and straw, leading into a combination of fresh fruit and earthy spice flavors. A great balance of acid, fruit and spice means it's assertive, but still poised. A fun wine with lots of character.",11.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
45743,Nobilo 2008 Regional Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"With more than a quarter of million cases of this wine coming to the U.S., Nobilo's Regional Collection SB will turn up on a lot of tables over the summer—and justifiably so. It's a very good rendition of Marlborough Sauvignon, offering grassy aromas and flavors backed by lime and grapefruit. It's plump enough to have mass appeal, with a refreshingly crisp finish. Like almost all NZ Savvies, it should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",13.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
45748,Quintay 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"New Zealand seems to be the model for this highly pungent and scrappy wine. To this taster, Quintay's basic Casablanca SB is easier to like and more balanced. This one is prickly to the max, with sweaty aromas and flavors of lemon-lime, tarragon and celery. It's sharp and cleansing, but not quite fruity and rewarding enough to rank as an excellent wine. Still, it has its virtues.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
45750,Robertson Winery 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Robertson),"Tropical fruit and a touch of lemon lead on this gentle white.

Soft spice and a lemon zing finish it off.",10.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
45761,Chrisohoou 2008 Red (Rapsani),"A rich nose of cloves, exotic spice and tobacco give this red a distinctive edge. The palate offers pronounced allspice and tobacco, touched by sweet oak, tea and red fruit. A good everyday wine with an exotic touch.",25.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
45768,Tritón 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",20.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
45771,Viña Alicia 2008 Tiara White (Luján de Cuyo),"An unusual blend of Riesling, Albariño and Sauvignon Blanc that is largely neutral on the nose and then waxy, honeyed and pithy in the mouth. Along the way there's an appealing dry, melony, petrol character and some good old-fashioned tang. A breed unto itself.",30.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
45772,Bodegas Murtia 2008 Cármine Monastrell (Jumilla),"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",30.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
45885,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"The blend in this torrid vintage is 68% Shiraz, 32% Cabernet, which somehow manages to avoid any sense of baked or raisined fruit. There's a slightly medicinal, eucalyptus note, common in wines from this big gumtree region, but also red currant and cherry fruit, a creamy, supple texture and a long finish dusted with cocoa powder. Drink now–2020.",42.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
46003,D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale),"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.",19.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
46126,Oliver Conti 2008 Carlota Red (Empordà),"Imagine all of the scents you associate with a Margherita pizza and that's what this wine smells like.

A blend of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",30.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
46129,Redbank 2008 The Long Paddock Pinot Grigio (Victoria),"Here's an Italian-styled Pinot Grigio, with a gently nutty nose and earthy low notes. It's faintly oily in the mouth but finishes crisp and light, with a pretty lemon zest accent. Drink up.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
46131,Peña Roble 2008  Ribera del Duero,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
46134,Sebeka 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"The fresh, likeable Sebeka SB starts with lively lemon, gooseberry and tropical aromas, followed by rounded flavors of fresh citrus, tropical fruit and fig. An easygoing white that pairs well with spicy cuisine, seafood.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
46161,Finca El Quiñón 2008 Chafandin  (Ribera del Duero),"Coconut, smoke and sweet aromas of cola, berry jam and fine tobacco make the bouquet inviting. In the mouth, it maintains freshness due to good acidity, while the flavors of earthy blackberry and plum come across dense and right. Firm and tannic on the finish; drink from 2012–2016.",65.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
46163,Kracher 2008 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 1 Trockenbeerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland),"This, the first of 12 grades of richness in the Kracher range in 2008, is already an intense wine, with concentrated orange marmalade and honey flavors. What gives it just the right fresh lift is the lemon acidity on the refreshing finish.",84.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
46170,Lamadrid 2008 Matilde Single Vineyard Malbec (Agrelo),"Like the winery's Gran Reserva '08, this is a saturated bomber that rides along the edge of overripeness. Aromas of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and coconut are rich and oaky. It feels tannic, with a beam of shrill acidity that props up flavors that otherwise might seem raisiny or pruney. Chocolate and wood resin tones pile up on the finish.",80.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
46187,Licinia 2008 Red (Vinos de Madrid),"Graham cracker, raisin, earth and leather aromas announce a level of richness. It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course.

46500,Alpha Estate 2008 Alpha One Unfiltered Merlot (Florina),"This Merlot from one of Greece's most exciting producers offers aromas of plum, black cherry and vanilla on the nose, followed by smooth, integrated flavors of black fruit, cinnamon, pepper and a spin of mint on the finish.

46514,Santa Rita 2008 Triple C Red (Maipo Valley),"Dry, leafy, herbal aromas come with berry power and spice. Triple C stands for Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon as well as Carmenère.

Drink through 2017.",40.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
46517,Fairview 2008 The Beacon Shiraz (Paarl),"This wine is immediately attractive, with initial aromas of ripe cherry, plum and berry fruits that are spiced with hints of Thin Mint, licorice and black pepper. Plush, but not overdone, the mouthfeel is like crushed velvet, with black cherry-skin and raspberry flavors and fine yet structured tannins. Glimmers of sweet smoke and black tea unfold on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2016.",36.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
46624,Ervideira 2008 Conde d'Ervideira Reserva Red (Alentejo),"A rustic wine that blends Cabernet Sauvignon with local fruit. It has a layer of wood, uncomfortable black currant acidity and a core of tannins.",20.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
46628,Meli 2008 Riesling (Maule Valley),"From the beginning this '08 seems as though it has turned; the nose is mildly oxidized and corny, and there's a shortage of freshness. The palate is dull and narrow, with limited apple and sour lime flavors. Acceptable but not at its peak anymore.",12.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
46700,François Lurton 2008 Piedra Negra Malbec (Mendoza),"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting.

46892,Finca Decero 2008 Remolinos Vineyard Malbec (Agrelo),"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs.

46905,Michel Torino 2008 Don David Reserve Tannat (Cafayate),"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length. It'll definitely last in a cellar, and that can only help soften the punishing tannins and mouthfeel that dominate the current state.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
46969,Hartenberg 2008 The Stork Shiraz (Stellenbosch),"A big and bold Shiraz, dark fruit aromas and flavors of fig, black cherry and plum abound. Glimmers of sweet spice and smoke unfold softly, showing the promise of additional complexities and nuance that should continue to develop with time.

47260,Wine & Soul 2008 Pintas Red (Douro),"Big, powerful wine that is restrained by its ripe, dusty tannins.

47497,Undurraga 2008 T.H. Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Common apple, melon and other green, zesty aromas work the nose, which is slightly more reserved than outright pungent.

Not out of the ordinary, but quite well made and cleansing.",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
47503,Alta 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Shows varietally correct grassiness and herbal notes on the nose, followed by round, honeyed fruit flavors that turn racy and grapefruity on the finish.

48423,CVNE 2008 Cune Reserva  (Rioja),"Stalky, short aromas suggest that this is raw and underripe. The palate feel confirms that impression; it's tight and choppy, with drying tannins.

48820,Elias Mora 2008 Crianza  (Toro),"An opaque color suggests power and density, and for the most part that's what you get. Jammy, raisiny aromas culminate with prune and berry pie scents. There's pointy acidity to the palate, which amplifies cassis, blackberry and carob flavors. A warm, long finish is the conclusion. Drink through 2016.",38.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477

It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
49386,Viu Manent 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold, juicy, a little aggressive and herbal, with ample berry and plum fruit at the base. Oaky and long on the finish, with a peppery, herbal ending.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
49433,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2008 Grande Escolha Syrah (Tejo),"This is a minty, aromatic Syrah, with tannins that are laced with violet and blackberry flavors. It's finely structured, and shows a spice charcter from the fruit that combines easily with the wood toast. Age for 4 years.",38.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49434,Quinta do Casal Branco 2008 Falcoaria Branco Fernão Pires (Tejo),"An impressive wine that is packed with notes of rich fruit, toast and vanilla. It has weight to its apple, peach and intense spice flavors. The style is like a ripe Chardonnay, just with extra acidity. Ready to drink, but could age for another year.",13.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49454,Concha y Toro 2008 Terrunyo Vineyard Selection Block 27 Unfiltered Carmenère (Peumo),"Dense in color, with earthy, crusty aromas of baked berry, moss, tobacco, cola and cassis. Feels lush, meaty and deep, with tobacco, balsamic flavors, baked blackberry and chocolate. Mellow, lightly herbal and smooth on the finish; hits all the high marks. Drink now.",38.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49517,Marqués de Gelida 2008 Brut Exclusive Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"The bouquet on this Cava is a bit gaseous, with mild lime and apple aromas. In the mouth, it's foamy but fresh and lifted. Flavors of candied apple and mango finish in sweet fashion. Nice for Cava but with limits.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
49528,Wirra Wirra 2008 Church Block Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz Red (McLaren Vale),"Medium to full bodied, with nicely supple tannins, Wirra Wirra's Church Block is an attractive wine for near-term consumption. Flavors in this blend of 48% Cabernet, 37% Shiraz and 15% Merlot range from broiled tomato to tart berry, then pick up some dried fruit character with air, finishing with an unusually tart edge.",20.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
49535,Marques de Griñon 2008 AAA Red (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Talk about an incredibly ripe wine; this deals prune, marzipan, tobacco and sandalwood aromas along with loads of blackberry and cassis. In the mouth, it's tannic like nails, with enormous blackberry and chocolate flavors that narrow down on a fast-charging but ultimately short finish. You can equate this to a rough and bumpy road that takes you to a nice vista. Drink through 2020.",250.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49542,Marques de Griñon 2008 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Petit Verdot (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Like it's one-year-older brother, this is tight as nails from head to toe. Cedar, graphite and zero funk drive a black-fruit-heavy nose toward a hard-driving palate with fierce tannins and flavors of blackberry, toast and chocolate. A blackened, spicy finish is demanding but pure. Drink now through 2020.",40.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49543,Marqués de Murrieta 2008 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),"There are wines with mass appeal and others that are so idiosyncratic that only one in five people might like it. This falls into the latter category; it's barrel-fermented Viura with Sherry, dry wood, butterscotch and corn cake aromas. The mouth is creamy and resiny, with integrated acidity that keeps it afloat. Flavors of spiced pear, vanilla, cinnamon and toffee suggest amontillado Sherry and something elusive yet refined. Drink now with a rich seafood dish like lobster or baked turbot.",28.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
49589,Höpler 2008 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"This is full and fruity, with a wood-influenced caramel edge and soft tannins. It has a spicy black-fruit flavor, and its bitter edge provides piquancy to its fruitiness. Not for aging. Screwcap.",22.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
49751,Quevedo 2008 Oscar's Red (Douro),"Oscar Quevedo, a new star of the Douro, has produced a stylish wine, suffused with tannins, fresh acidity, solid black fruits and a lively bright feel. It is ready to drink, but could age 3–4 years.",12.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
49773,Carić 2008 Plovac Polški Plavac Mali (Hvar),"From the island of Hvar, this wine has aromas of Chinese tea and cranberry juice. There's also a pleasant feral note in the complex bouquet. It has flavors of cranberry juice and black cherry tart with grippy tannins and a persistent finish.",27.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
49832,Caves Transmontanas 2008 Brut Gouveio (Douro),"This aromatic wine, floral and ripe, is made from the Gouveio grape (known in Spain as Godello). The wine has a rich, yeasty character as well as crisp white fruits and acidity. It is finely balanced, ready to drink now.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
49837,Matetic 2008 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"The low-level “good” rating is more a reflection of the wine's age than its core qualities. It's flat and wayward now, with no real direction to the nose or palate. It tastes bland and semisweet, with dying acids and simple flavors of apple and melon. Go with the '09, then look for the '10.",20.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
49842,Ventisquero 2008 Queulat Gran Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Brambly red-fruit aromas of currants and pie cherry are on the sharp side, while the palate is clacky and tannic, with crisp red-plum, herb and wayward oak flavors. Finishes full and rugged, with toasty heat and an herbal aftertaste. Not a bad wine but it's fairly typical for Chilean Merlot.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
49864,Bodegas Pirineos 2008 Mesache Red (Somontano),"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta.",11.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
49935,Tsantali 2008 Kanenas Maronia Vineyards Mavroudi-Syrah Red (Ismarikos),"A perfumed nose of violet, black cherry and cedar give this Syrah-Mavroudi blend a seductive start. On the palate, black fruit and spice flavors are balanced, but not overly complex. A solid everyday red with indigenous appeal, and a great match for pasta with red sauces, pizza or steak.",20.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
50001,Ernie Els 2008 Signature Red (Stellenbosch),"This is a dark, dense and brooding Bordeaux-style blend, comprised of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. Notes of cocoa, cigar tobacco and leather jazz up the black-fruit core of cassis, black plum and berry. The palate is full and gripping, with firm tannins that hang on tightly through the long and slightly smoky finish. Drink after decanting now, or enjoy through 2018.",95.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
50022,Reilly's 2008 Barking Mad Shiraz (Clare Valley),"A top value in drink-now Shiraz, Reilly's 2008 Barking Mad shows none of the overripe character that plagued the vintage. It's almost floral on the nose, with an intense crème de framboise character. Raspberry, coffee and chocolate notes marry easily on the palate, and although it's not that concentrated, it is full in the mouth and lushly textured on the finish. Drink now–2015.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
50024,Bellingham 2008 Fair Maiden White (Franschhoek),"Vanilla, honey, citrus and spice aromas lead this luscious white blend from Bellingham. On the palate, vanilla, lemon and creamy white fruit all mingle in a round, integrated character, but are spun with spice. A pretty, appealing white with something for everyone.",19.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
50042,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2008 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"This may be simple Zweigelt, but it has a great structure, bringing out an impressively complex juice and tannin combination, with a ripe sweet character, black berry fruits and a core of tight, mineral tannins. The finish is open, warm and juicy.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
50079,Naia 2008 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda),"Smoky, toasty and without a doubt barrel fermented. This feels a little raw and tannic for a white wine, but it's also grippy, elevated and fruity. On the palate, things open with a blast of apple and raw oak; the finish is long and tastes of butterscotch and dried apple. A classy wine from some of the oldest vines in Rueda.",29.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
50174,Finca Valpiedra 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"The cold, rainy conditions of 2008 must have affected this wine. Vegetal aromas, vinegar and green notes drive the nose, while the flavor profile is briny and pickled to an extreme. High acidity and green flavors draw down the finish.",40.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
50211,Huerta de Albalá 2008 Taberner No1 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz),"Aromas of earthy, nutty, mature berry fruits come with a hint of raisin and a touch of compost. This saturated Vino de Cádiz is composed of 80% Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a heavy wine with flavors of vanilla, burnt wood, blackened spices and stewed berries. The finish tastes peppery, dark and outright woody. Drink through 2019.",90.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
50473,Quevedo 2008 Quinta Vale d'Agodinho Vintage  (Port),"Dry, firm and toasty, this has acidity over a tight black currant character. That makes it feel almost as much wine as Port, the woody character adding to the dry side.",68.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
50500,Greek Wine Cellars 2008 Moschofilero (Mantinia),"This delicate white offers aromas of roses and a palate of spice and flowers that are both lively and sweet. Distinctive and elegant. Pair with poultry, pork and seafood.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
50817,Brancott 2008 Festival Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Leafy at first, but those greenish notes are backed by plenty of stone fruits and pineapple. It's plump and round in the mouth, with a long, clean, zesty finish. Drink now.",26.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
50836,Trivento 2008 Amado Sur Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah Red (Mendoza),"Savory and full, with dusty black fruit aromas, saucy spice and kick. The palate shows good feel and depth, and the flavors of savory berry, bacon fat and vanilla work well together. Mild herb and leaf notes give complexity to the finish, which is long and fades away comfortably.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
50837,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Azul Portugal Red (Douro),"Ripe and smooth wine, with a rich Port-like aroma, the sweet fruit structured with some fresh stalky tannins. Great herbal and wild berry flavors to finish.",10.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
50839,Bodegas Caro 2008 Amancaya Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Sweet and open on the nose, with blackberry and pure grape aromas. The palate has a tight, drawing texture but rewarding flavors of spice and roasted berry fruit. Long and flavorful on the finish, with bite and tannic residue. A wine with positive components but a rough young feel.",20.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
50844,Altos del Cuco 2008 Red (Yecla),"A smooth wine for the price where all the dots connect. The nose has black cherry and raisin, while the palate is lush, deep and concentrated, with rewarding flavors of cherry, cassis and roasted plum. Lasting on the finish, with a licorice flavor. Very good wine for the money; Monastrell/Syrah/Tempranillo is the blend.",10.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
51026,Condesa Eylo 2008 Verdejo (Rueda),"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",14.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
51029,Viña Godeval 2008 Cosecha Godello (Valdeorras),"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
51035,Kangarilla Road 2008 Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale),"There's a healthy 8% Viognier in the blend, but this wine doesn't come across as overtly apricotty. Instead, it delivers big blueberries and blackberries on the nose and hints of plum and cola, with just a hint of raisining. It's full bodied—almost viscous in texture—balanced by crisp acids on the finish. Drink now-2016.",27.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
51040,Water Wheel 2008 Memsie Shiraz-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Bendigo),"Made in a mouthfilling, supple style, this cheerful blend is easy to like and easy on the pocketbook. Black cherry and vanilla notes are perhaps a little simple, but carried along by a rich, creamy mouthfeel and a lingering finish, they make for a satisfying glass of hearty red. Drink now-2014.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
51088,Honoratus 2008 Aurum Crianza White (Rioja),"This oxidized, woody white displays Sherry aromas of flor and peanut buttter, but little to no fruit. Crisp acidity corrals the palate, while barrel-driven flavors are front and center, and once again, fruit is hard to find. Overall, this is stylistically iconoclastic, but the execution is good. Drink through 2022.",40.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
51148,Concha y Toro 2008 Trio Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"We haven't seen anything labeled Trio for years, but the return of this Concha y Toro brand seems solid. Aromas of orange blossom, lime and other green fruits are good, while flavors of citrus, grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
51160,Undurraga 2008 Aliwen Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Fresh but not overly racy, with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate, but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said, the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow, and the finish is more of the same. Drink now.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
51161,Vavasour 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley),"Vavasour has done better than this in the past, and undoubtedly will do better in the future. The 2008 just lacks a bit of the jacked-up pungency that it has had in the past, instead offering relatively tame white grapefruit aromas and flavors and just a touch of grassiness. Well made, clean and refreshing.",20.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
51208,Finca La Emperatriz 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Leathery, baked aromas of earthy berry fruits and coffee grinds take time to unwind. This feels solid and tight due to potent acidity, while the flavors lean in the direction of stewed prune and berry. On the finish, flavors of chocolate, cherry and cassis are integrated.",36.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
51274,Bibich 2008 Riserva R5 White (North Dalmatia),"High-toned apples and pears and a grassy, herbal note scent this unique blend of Croatian and international grape varieties. Deep gold in color, it's a savory wine with a bruised apple palate, but an interesting pick for everyday.",19.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
51395,Andeluna 2008 Pasionado Cabernet Franc (Tupungato),"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.",60.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
51571,Marco Abella 2008 Mas Mallola Red (Priorat),"Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.",50.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
51587,O. Fournier 2008  Ribera del Duero,"Cool berry, graphite, cola and prune are the lead aromas on this ripe RDD. In the mouth, choppy tannins and firm acids create a strong, edgy feel. Flavors of cassis, wild berry, coconut and vanilla announce ripeness and plenty of oak. It finishes with abrupt tannins, tons of residual flavor and weight. Drink now through 2021.",85.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
51631,Domaine Sigalas 2008 Mavrotragano (Santorini),"A surprise from the Assyrtiko-dominant island of Santorini, this delicious red is made from an endangered island variety. Rich aromas of cherry, violet and clove are followed by a balanced array of juicy red and black berry and complex warming spice flavors. The tannins are firm but the wine is smooth in the mouth. Pair with meat and rich cheeses. A find.",50.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
51651,Graham Beck 2008 The Ridge Syrah (Robertson),"Ripe, rich and overall yummy, this Syrah offers bright notes of red plum and cherry laced with a touch of gaminess and soft foliage. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts fine tannins and prominent acidity that provides a nice lift to the long, spicy finish.",23.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
51829,Morandé 2008 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley),"Solid, deep and earthy smelling, with cola, mushroom, violet and tree bark aromas. The palate is smooth and balanced, with dark berry, baked plum, chocolate and spice flavors. Dry, foresty and healthy as can be on the finish. Exemplary for the price.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
52027,Istravino 2008 De Mar Cuvée Zenon Red (Istria),"Juicy red plums and cherries, vanilla and smoke are pleasant on the nose and palate of this Bordeaux-style red from Istria, but gain freshness and verve from layers of bramble, menthol and fresh herbs. Full bodied with exceptionally integrated tannins that are soft and round, it's a big surprise at $13.",13.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
52408,Valdivieso 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A good effort given the price. Although the nose is a little bland, the wine is clean and shows hints of pear and sweet grapefruit. The palate is wet and not overly concentrated, so things flow easily as it delivers tepid lime and citrus flavors. A lightweight made for limited-thought quaffing, which is exactly what you should expect for eight bucks.",8.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52415,Arboleda 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"There's something plaguing the nose here: talcum powder? air freshener? Whatever, it seems powdery and a touch artificial. The palate features soft flavors of green bean and orange juice, and the mild vegetal character carries onto the finish. Plump, with some friendliness, but a touch green.",18.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52423,Misiones de Rengo 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"The bouquet delivers moderate citrus and snap, while the palate offers midlevel varietal flavors of lime and generic citrus. There's a smattering of green-herb character, while the finish is peppery, light, a touch watery but fresh. Drink soon and it should elicit more smiles than frowns.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52686,Terra Andina 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"A bit green and ashy, with aromas of green bean, green tobacco and bell pepper. It's not over-the-top vegetal, but it does deal plenty of green bean and celery in addition to tangerine. As a whole it's wet and easy on the palate, but it doesn't have the clarity of flavor and pure fruit that we're seeking from Leyda and Chile as a whole.",14.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52687,Viña Requingua 2008 Puerto Viejo Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Slightly sweet and powdery smelling, with simple creaminess to the orange-influenced nose. The palate is solid and plump, with basic citrus flavors that shouldn't steer you wrong. Nice feel and a good but regular finish seal the deal.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52688,Yali 2008 Winemaker's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),"Easygoing on the nose, with light melon and green-fruit aromas. Yet it's crisp in the mouth, but sort of choppy and tart as well. The wine is refreshing but short and linear, as if some of the pulp and power were siphoned off. What's left is fresh and lasting, but a little weak in flavor.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52689,Fairvalley 2008 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"This unoaked white offers rounded tropical fruit aromas and flavors like pineapple, melon and pear. The style is straightforward and exuberant, with balanced acidity and a fruity, lush finish. Keep on the table for everyday enjoyment.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52690,Fleur Du Cap 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"An elegant white with a nose that combines zippy citrus, minerals and a touch of guava. The palate offers clean and spritzy character with a wave of rounding tropical fruit and a spin of spice. Pair with spicy food—think Indian or Thai.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52692,Haras 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"A little soft and heavy on the nose, which conveys a sense of overripeness. In the mouth, it's not overly heavy but it is sort of chunky as flavors of apple and citrus brush up against mealy but then draw back to a fresher place. Finishes mild, with only a modicum of acidity. Drink soon for best results.",12.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52693,Beau Joubert 2008 Oak Lane Chenin Blanc-Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),"An elegant, perfumed nose of white flowers and crisp fruit is followed by light, flirty flavors of honey, gooseberry and lemon. Soft and simple, the wine has a pretty quality and a good balance of fruit and acidity.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
52695,Two Oceans 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Two Oceans offers a friendly, vibrant sip with this Sauvignon Blanc. Tropical fruit, gooseberry, some straw on the nose and simple, fresh citrus and fleshy tropical fruit flavors give the wine complexity. A fun white with some heft.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
52913,Quinta dos Murças 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"This wine, the first vintage produced by the Esporão winemaking team, gives fine, elegant Douro tannins along with new wood and rich flavors of damson and blackberry. It is structured, powerful and very age worthy. Keep for at least four years.",30.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
52933,Zinio 2008  Rioja,"Dry herb and spice aromas precede a solid, drawn-down palate, with lively acidity and flavors of medium-dark berry, toast and herb. Modest in intensity, this is composed.",11.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
52957,Dão Sul 2008 Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada White (Dão),"A soft, clean, fruity wine, with spice and a fresh, aromatic character. The lemon and white fruit flavors are in an easy, apéritif style, with a lightly sweet aftertaste.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
52960,Bodega Norton 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors. This one will wet the whistle but it turns monotone on the finish. Drink as soon as possible for maximum vitality.",11.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
52996,Vidigal 2008 Red (Douro),"While this is lightweight for a Douro wine, it does have a backbone of tannin. It is warm, with its damson jelly flavors giving a reassuring winter feel. The texture shows dusty tannins and a final juicy character. Screwcap.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
53118,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2008 Noemía Malbec (Río Negro Valley),"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.",108.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
53638,Chapel Hill 2008 The Parson's Nose Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Full-bodied and supple in texture, this plummy Shiraz offers plenty of enjoyment at a realistic price. Vanilla and brown sugar notes frame blueberries and spice, with just a hint of bitterness apparent on the finish. Drink now–2012.",18.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
53640,Finca Agostino 2008 Chardonnay-Viognier (Mendoza),"Smooth baked apple aromas work well, and the peach and vanilla side notes are equally good. Plump and easygoing on the palate, with honeyed apple and banana flavors, and then creamy on the finish, with vanilla and spice. Sweet, good and easy to enjoy.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
53733,DiamAndes 2008 de Uco Gran Reserva Red (Uco Valley),"Blackberry, blueberry and maple aromas announce a rich, ripe wine. There's also toast and char on the nose. In the mouth, this is layered and grabby, with mossy black-fruit flavors that end in a cool, earthy swirl of cola and licorice. This blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Syrah is a stunner and should be consumed now through 2016.",40.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
53841,Susana Balbo 2008 Crios Torrontés (Salta),"Expect to see plenty of this Torrontés across the States (18,000 cases have been imported). But also expect a wine that's lemony and that carries scents of floor polish and air freshener. Being lithe and jumpy is not an issue; the wine is definitely lively. But it doesn't have that ethereal, tropical quality that the best Torrontes' have. It's narrow and limited.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
53895,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Azul Portugal Red (Bairrada),"Made from fruit that's sourced from the Buçaco Mountains in the east of Bairrada, this wine is rich and elegant, and its juicy fruit provides a counterbalance to the structure. With its youthful fruitiness, this is worth aging for another 2–3 years.",11.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
54254,Campolargo 2008 Os Corvos da Vinha da Costa Red (Bairrada),"Named after the crows that fly on the Campolargo estate, this is a warm, ripely fruity wine with sweet flavors and soft tannins. It is ready to drink, a delicious winter warmer.",13.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
54384,O. Fournier 2008 B Crux Red (Uco Valley),"Opens with horsey, leathery aromas that are funky and wild, but are surrounded by solid berry-fruit scents. Picks up steam on the palate, which is easygoing, solidly built and just firm enough. Tastes of blackberry, cola, spice and chocolate, then finishes smooth and creamy.",25.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
54392,Alonso del Yerro 2008 María  (Ribera del Duero),"A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age.",102.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
54465,Castell 2008 Casteller Reitsteig Trocken Spätburgunder (Franken),"Slightly feral, with baked fruit notes alongside hints of coffee grounds. Disappointing; lacks freshness.",76.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
54472,Viña Bisquertt 2008 La Joya Reserve Viognier (Colchagua Valley),Heavy and soupy in its current state. This is one chunked-out white wine that is barely hanging on with flavors of papaya and dried-out peach. Has lost whatever freshness it may have had.,12.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
54495,Thorn Clarke 2008 William Randell Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Shows some of the warmth of the vintage in its elevated alcohol levels and high-toned fruit.

54508,Dr. Loosen 2008 Erdener Treppchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,30.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
54521,Prinz 2008 Hallgartener Jongfer Spätlese Goldkap Riesling (Rheingau),"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",43.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
54526,Johannishof 2008 G Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau),"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",29.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
54542,Quinta de São José 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"Concentrated and dense, very structured, swathed in sweet ripe plums, dark chocolate, spice and balancing acidity. This is complex, dark, while remaining stylish. For aging over 5–6 years.",43.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
54598,Altanza 2008 Dominio de Heredia  (Rioja),"Starts out heavy and roasted, with herbal, earthy berry aromas settling in. Feels pruney but there's also acidity, while the flavors run herbal and peppery as prune and plum represent the fruit side. Decent but doesn't fully click.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
54665,Viña Bisquertt 2008 Ecos de Rulo Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Dark fruit aromas lead a rustic, earthy, smoky bouquet towards a crisp, healthy palate with ample oak that creates a buttery taste to accent dry berry flavors, a light herbal character and pepper. Fresh, solid and well oaked.",18.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477

54915,Bodegas Escudero 2008 Vidau  (Rioja),"Rooty/ berry aromas come with a big heaping of mature earth tones and cool cola accents. This is ripped with acidity, which makes sense since 2008 was a chilly, wet year. Bold berry, plum, cherry and tobacco flavors finish easy and smooth; drink through 2020.",88.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
54964,Monte da Ravasqueira 2008 Vinha das Romãs Red (Alentejano),"Named after the pomegranate orchard that existed before the vines, this is a powerful, dense wine, concentrated with fruit and dark tannins.

54966,Quinta da Nespereira 2008 Vineaticu Red (Dão),"A rich wine that takes time to show its structure, starting with blackberry fruits, then revealing firm, closed tannins. The wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, giving off power and complexity.",18.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
54971,Companhia das Quintas 2008 Quinta da Pancas Reserva Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),"Pure Touriga Nacional, firm while also fruity, this is an intense, aromatic and finely perfumed, smokey wine. The wood aging has softened the tannins while keeping the structure.",21.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
54976,Quinta da Cortezia 2008 Reserva Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),"A very aromatic, violet-perfumed wine. It has structured fruit, with wood and blackberry flavors, plenty of acidity and long-term aging potential.",16.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
54983,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2008 Aragonês de Peceguina Aragonês (Alentejano),"Aragonês, a k a Tempranillo and Tinta Roriz, is the source of this smooth, rich wine that shows great elegance despite its high alcohol. It has concentration, very dense fruit flavors and a gorgeous ripe finish.",70.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
55026,Cono Sur 2008 Merlot (Central Valley),"A full, generic berry fruit opening is not such a bad thing for value-priced Chilean Merlot. Fresh and fruity in the mouth, with no hard edge or bite. A mild herbal layer settles in on the finish. Tight and solid overall.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
55081,Vila 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Minty, herbal and slightly grassy on the nose, and of course there's berry fruit to boot. The palate has normal feel and balance, with regular red fruit flavors from the currant and cherry family. Lengthy on the finish, but overall it's as basic as they come.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
55082,Viu Manent 2008 Estate Collection Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Jumbled aromas of grilled meat, asphalt and black cherry candy require patience and modest standards, while the palate is regular, a touch sticky and cloying, with sweet but generic berry fruit flavors. Dry and fairly snappy on the finish.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
55092,Pratsch 2008 Select Riesling (Niederösterreich),"A curiously textured wine, with dry stone fruit characters, missing some of the aromatic virtues of Riesling. That said, it has good freshness, white currant acidity and a light, crisp finish. Screwcap.",22.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
55096,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is. The nose bleeds resin and faux milk chocolate, while the chunky, herbal palate offers pretty good mouthfeel but also roasted berry flavors. Menthol and herbal notes rise up on the hot finish.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
55146,Martín Berdugo 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
55158,Wolf Blass 2008 Gold Label Shiraz (Barossa),"An excellent value, the 2008 Gold Label Shiraz is a full-bodied, powerfully built wine, filled out by cassis, chocolate and tobacco flavors. It's long and velvety on the finish, not just an upfront powerhouse. Drink now–2020.",25.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
55160,Chapel Hill 2008 Bush Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale),"This ripe Grenache is full-bodied and fruit-driven, but seems to have the stuffing to last at least 3–4 years. Cherry-berry flavors are punched up by herb and spice shadings that linger on the finish.",29.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
55197,Sundance 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Powdery and sweet smelling, with an acidic palate propelling pedestrian green apple, lime and orange flavors.

55292,Antonio Gonzalez 2008 Don Antonio Grand Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy, with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry, while the finish feels sticky, tannic and heavy.",35.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
55312,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley),"A little funky and cheesy on the nose, with leather, olive and leafy berry fruit aromas. The palate feel is staunch and tannic, with dry, roasted flavors of red berries and herbs. Finishes baked, with some heat and smoke. Hard and tannic stuff, but also flavorful and generous.",22.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
55313,Lapostolle 2008 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Quite earthy and sun-baked to start, with raisiny aromas that come with cola and leather. Thick, dense and heavy in the mouth, with concentrated, baked flavors of blackberry, pepper and bitter chocolate. A superripe, inky wine with soft tannins and a spongey finish.",24.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
55371,Pewsey Vale 2008 Individual Vineyard Selection Pinot Gris (Eden Valley),"This Pinot Gris is marching to the beat of its own drum, with some funky aromas and toast notes along with lemon and pear fruit. It's a tad volatile in the mouth but has some nice depth of flavor and a lingering cashew finish. Likeable for its originality.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
55374,Redbank 2008 The Long Paddock Pinot Grigio (Victoria),"Here's an Italian-styled Pinot Grigio, with a gently nutty nose and earthy low notes. It's faintly oily in the mouth but finishes crisp and light, with a pretty lemon zest accent. Drink up.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
55429,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Cool, subtle aromas of cola, rooty black cherry and blackberry precede a flush, racy, tannic palate.

55438,Concha y Toro 2008 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Sweet, minty and confected, with marshmallow and candied berry aromas. The mouthfeel is tangy on the surface and hollow down below, while the palate has average size along with vanilla-infused berry flavors. Lean on the finish. More than 300,000 cases produced.",10.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
55439,Gauchezco 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.",14.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
55508,Sineann 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Made in a ripe style, this Sauvignon Blanc from Oregon-based Peter Rosback features hints of honey alongside nectarine and tropical fruit flavors. It's round on the palate; a ripe, easygoing wine for immediate consumption.",20.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
55519,In Situ 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"More than decent; this is good SB with no bells and whistles but lots of straight-ahead competence. The nose is dusty and plump, while the palate has roundness, weight and likable citrus, green melon and other common, fresh flavors. Sometimes the basics are more than enough; this is a casein point.",5.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
55522,La Playa 2008 Block Selection Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley),"This is a perfectly good and honest wine, with aromas of fresh lettuce yet not a whole lot of vivid fruit. So in that sense, it is like many SBs from cool-climate Limarí. But if the nose is shy, the palate offers nice, cheerful apple and melon flavors. Smooth enough and almost round, withno edgy acidity or overt zap.",11.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
55525,Montes 2008 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever.",12.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
55536,Carmen 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Varietally correct, with familiar prickly aromas along with citrus and sweat. It's pretty much all you could ask for at under $10, and with honest lemon and pineapple flavors its committed and alive.

55597,Viña Mein 2008 Fermentado en Barrica White (Ribeiro),"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",20.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
55604,Jaspi 2008 Negre Red (Montsant),"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",20.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
55789,Barker's Marque 2008 3 Brooms Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The bold aromas are chili peppery, just hinting at riper fruit below, but the flavors are reversed, with peach and pineapple in the lead followed by peppery notes. This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc ends on notes of grapefruit and jalapeno; really good for the price.",13.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
55820,Thymiopoulos 2008 Uranos Xinomavro (Naoussa),"Violet, black fruit and cedar notes lead this poised red. The palate is plush, but finishes clean and dry. Subtle, clean and focused, it's a good wine to savor alone or with steak.",35.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
56071,Taron 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Dusty berry aromas blend with mint and herbal notes. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched; flavors of baked black fruits, vanilla and dill are earthy on the finish, which is chunky but generally balanced.",17.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
56191,Juvé y Camps 2008 Brut Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"With lemon-lime and lemongrass aromas, this Cava is slightly exotic on the bouquet. The palate feels good but not terribly interesting or complex, with flavors of dusty apple, peach and vanilla. With a short finish, this vintage sparkler is fine but not as good as in the past.",50.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
56238,Alma del Sur 2008 Seleccionada Bonarda (Mendoza),"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
56255,Bodega Norton 2008 Barrel Select Merlot (Mendoza),"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
56271,Errazuriz 2008 Viñedo Chadwick Red (Maipo Valley),"Round, dark and impressive, with deep berry aromas, minerality, smokiness and a hint of herbs and tomato.

Drink now through 2017.",260.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
56335,François Lurton 2008 Piedra Negra Malbec (Mendoza),"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting.

56345,Trivento 2008 Golden Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Opens with a blast of milk chocolate, raisin and sawdust before settling on black fruit and pepper.

56357,Prada A Tope 2008 Palacio de Canedo Ecológico Crianza Mencía (Bierzo),"This aged wine is oaky to an extreme, with minty, resiny aromas that crowd out dried raspberry and currant notes.

56484,Monte dos Cabaços 2008 Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano),The Estremoz region in Alentejo is at the heart of one of the major vineyard areas.

56819,Legaris 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Dark fruits, leather, compost and burnt aromas blend together on the nose.

56883,Ostatu 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"This is so toasty and heavily oaked that it smells burnt and acrid. In the mouth this is pinched, tannic and tough. Flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla finish scratchy and abrasive with drum-like tightness. Drink now.",33.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
57179,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2008 Touriga Nacional da Peceguina Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),"Perfumed with violets and smoky wood, this rich wine moves away from structured Touriga Nacional to a more opulent interpretation. It is hugely rich, with a major spice and herbal character. Without apparent acidity, it is not for aging.",70.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
57186,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2008 Touriga Nacional (Douro),"Here are all the perfumes and tannins of Touriga Nacional. The wine does, though, seem one-dimensional, the fruit offering acidity, berry flavors and fresh acidity.",100.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
57405,Dão Sul 2008 Monte da Cal Reserva Red (Alentejano),"A properly rich wine that benefits from its wood aging to give a polished, minty feel to the plush black plum fruits. Solid tannins are easily enveloped by fruit, while retaining a firm structure. Keep for 2-3 years.",20.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
57481,Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Limited Edition Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff.

57538,Castillo de Sajazarra 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Smoke and leather aromas are matched by dried red fruit and spice tones. This is racy on the palate, with a fairly full body. Vanilla and caramel flavors turn darker and toastier with airing, while the fruit on this older Rioja favors cherry and currant. Cocoa, tobacco notes with a juicy length define the finish. Drink through 2024.",35.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
57602,La Universal 2008 Dido Red (Montsant),"Baked and rubbery up front, with asphalt, roasted peanut and black fruit aromas.

57786,Alberti 154 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive, but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
57792,Nessa 2008 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
57800,Borges 2008 Meia Encosta White (Dão),"A soft wine, creamy and ripe. The flavors are open, with white fruits, green plums, a baked apple character. There is acidity, but with the gentle, ripe fruit, this blends in easily. For early drinking.",8.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
57815,Sancho Barón 2008  Rioja,"Wide aromas suggest earth and compost, rubber, strawberry and green. It's got the size and hits hard, but the flavors are a bit too leafy and green. Toasty and oaky on the finish.",32.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
57818,Dehesa de Luna 2008 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Prickly aromas of vinegar, pickled rhubarb and bramble don't exactly roll out the red carpet. The palate has a decent feel, but it's thick and borderline cloying. Tastes both green and sweet, with creamy vanilla and carob flavors. Burnt tasting on the finish.",18.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
57843,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Pégo Red (Douro),"An attractive, red-fruited wine, lightweight with acidity and smoothed with wood. It is fresh, with coffee and black cherry flavors, now ready to drink.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
57940,Torbreck 2008 Cuvée Juveniles Red (Barossa Valley),"Despite the presence of Shiraz and Mataro in the blend, this shows some of Grenache's shortcomings in its straightforward, almost confected red berry aromas and flavors. It's a bold mouthful of fruit that's a bit syrupy in texture.",22.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
57948,Abad 2008 Gotín del Risc Red (Bierzo),"Opens with burnt, rubbery aromas that eventually cede to asphalt, roasted peanut and leather. The palate is soft and a bit hollow in the middle, with earthy, rubbery flavors of black plum and berry. Finishes with cola, bitter coffee and root beer flavors. Decent and full overall, but rubbery.",14.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
57951,Bodegas Fariña 2008 Dama de Toro  (Toro),"Mildy green tobacco aromas lead the way along with forest floor, fern notes and standard berry aromas. The palate opens with forceful acidity, while the flavors are a bit underdeveloped as they lean toward blackberry. Mild bitterness is also part of the picture as the wine flattens out on the back side.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
58004,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 MC  (Rioja),"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017.",46.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
58008,Taylor Fladgate 2008 Quinta de Vargellas Vintage  (Port),"A beautiful, fruity wine that also has good structure to balance its black plum fruits. The acidity is important, although the wine as a whole is on the dry side, with spice and dominant final tannins.",65.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
58012,Dow's 2008 Quinta do Bomfim Vintage  (Port),"Dominated by acidity and a smoky character, the wine has great balance, with flavors of caramel, red cherry and sweet fruits. It shows a generous character that is attractive for early drinking.",60.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
58058,El Arte de Vivir 2008  Ribera del Duero,"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",17.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
58059,Espiritu de Argentina 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Snappy, prickly, red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity, creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine, with bramble and tartness.",9.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
58067,Lagarde 2008 Syrah (Mendoza),"Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.",18.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
58070,Michel Torino 2008 Don David Reserve Syrah (Cafayate),"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.",16.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
58075,Legón 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",14.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
58108,Juvé y Camps 2008 Milesimé Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"This Cava is mustardy smelling, with apple in tow.

58125,De Grendel 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Durbanville),"Fresh but earthy aromas of apple, fig and pepper give this intriguing wine extra draw.

58140,Graham Beck 2008 Gamekeeper's Reserve Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This exemplary Chenin starts with aromas of peach, pineapple and vanilla, rolling into juicy flavors of melon, honey and rich fruit.

58319,Tsantali 2008 Metoxi Chromitsa Limnio-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Agioritikos),"Leather, dry spice rub and crushed green herb aromas start this Limnio/Cabernet blend from northern Greece.

58483,La Bodega de Pinoso 2008 Flos de Pinoso Made With Organic Grapes Monastrell (Alicante),"A bit hard and sharp on the nose, but on the plus side it's clean and direct. The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and quick on the finish, with a mild resiny leftover oak character.",13.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
58778,Saronsberg 2008 Full Circle Red (Tulbagh),"This Shiraz-based blend—with splashes of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier—is lush and rich, with notes of ripe blackberry, cherry and strawberry preserves backed by hints of fruit-cake spice and black pepper. The plush mouthfeel boasts similarly concentrated dark-fruit flavors, and the finish boasts a decadent fudgy chocolate note that shows good staying power.

58826,Wittmann 2008 Westhofener Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Mid-gold in color, with attractive aromas of ripe stone fruits.

58842,Knipser 2008 Trocken Chardonnay Weissburgunder (Pfalz),"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice.

Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",25.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
59188,Ventisquero 2008 Queulat Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Quelat is Ventisquero's highest-reaching SB, but it seems narrow and ultra tight, with match stick on the nose and not a ton of fruit. As it unwinds, more aromas and flavors come out; but always is it slightly vegetal. Alongside that dominant “green” character, look for pineapple and plenty of acidity.",15.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
59189,Viña Bisquertt 2008 Casa La Joya Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),"Round on the nose, with green-apple aromas.

59197,Slowine 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Overberg),"A pretty tropical fruit nose leads on this Sauvignon Blanc from a consistently good producer. On the palate, the lush fruit falls a little flat, but the wine has a simple and dependable character that makes for good everyday sipping. Crisp and with a touch of delicate fruit, it has character and charm.",12.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
59328,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Dry, smoky and rubbery on the nose, with olive notes. The palate is a bit sharp, with plum, berry and herbal flavors. Finishes mildly leafy, with solid overall fruit and common Chilean herbal-green notes.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477

59333,Andeluna 2008 Malbec (Tupungato),"Formely known as Winemaker's Selection, this base-level Malbec is ultra purple and dark, with gritty, grapey aromas that are big but not all that well formed.

59912,José Maria da Fonseca 2008 Twin Vines White (Vinho Verde),"The perfect summer apéritif, this light, fresh, crisp wine tastes just drier than previous vintages, allowing the apple and lemon fruits to shine even more.

60404,Remhoogte 2008 Aigle Noir Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"Though the nose is a bit muted, assertive juicy black plum and muddled mulberry unfold in the round mouth.

60684,Skouras 2008 Grande Cuvée Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"Mocha, raspberry, sour cherry and spice are the focus of this plucky red from Skouras. The wine has focus and a masculine edge, and should pair well with dried meats, spicy pasta sauces and salty cheeses.",26.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477

60761,Quinta do Vallado 2008 Sousão (Douro),"Dense color is the character of the Sousão grape, and this wine—almost black—exhibits that character very well. For taste, cherry juice, cranberry and chewy tannins are sharpened by acidity.",40.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
60765,Beronia 2008 Reserva Selección de 198 Barricas  (Rioja),"Inviting aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and rooty blackberry are a high point on this slightly hollow Rioja reserva.

Luckily, there's enough acidity and supporting elements of earthy tobacco and wild animal to keep it balanced and lifted enough. Decant if drinking now, or hold for another couple of years.",47.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
61287,Familia Cassone 2008 Obra Prima Coleccion Gran Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"The bouquet is stylish and rooty, with black-fruit and chocolate scents leading the charge.

The wine has a tarry character along with its blackberry acidity, sweetness and an extra roundness from the wood. Worth aging for 3–4 years.",40.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
63003,Bodega Catena Zapata 2008 Catena Alta Malbec (Mendoza),"Concentrated black fruit aromas are subtle and don't push real hard. It's jammy, deep and soft in the mouth, with sweet tannins and even sweeter core berry flavors and oak. Finishes smooth, with barrel influence and warmth. Very nice as always, but not as elevated and exact as prior vintages.",50.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
63121,Errazuriz 2008 La Cumbre Syrah (Aconcagua Valley),"Supermodern in style, with mint, coconut, chocolate and huge black fruit aromas.

63123,Caves Aliança 2008 T Quinta da Terrugem Red (Alentejo),"Firm and structured, this is a densely rich wine for aging. Firm tannins dominate its ripe black fruit, lending notes of spice, licorice and toast from the wood. It needs several years of aging to round out—give it four years at least.",69.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
63138,Caves Aliança 2008 Quinta da Garrida Reserva Red (Dão),"Full bodied and rich, this has a juicy core followed by firm, minerally tannins and intense acidity. Wood aging adds complexity to this impressive, ageworthy effort.",19.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
63146,Adega Mayor 2008 Pai Chão Garrafeira Red (Alentejano),"The top red from Adega Mayor, this is serious and impressive. Its firm, dry and dusty tannins are balanced by an intense blackberry flavor and contrasted with licorice and coffee notes. As it ages, it will become more intense and elegant.",70.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
63179,El Coto 2008 Coto Real Reserva  (Rioja),"Tobacco, dill and vanilla aromas transition to cherry and raspberry scents.

63240,Marques de Griñon 2008 El Rincón Estate Bottled Syrah-Grenache (Vinos de Madrid),"Aromas of dried spices, earth, cola and obligatory black fruits open this Syrah-Garnacha blend. The palate features grabby tannins and flavors of blackberry, herbs and leather. On the finish, a licorice flavor pops up and blends into earthy notes supported by muscular tannins. Drink through 2017.",30.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
63454,Gunter Triebaumer 2008 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland),"Very honeyed, liquorous wine, with a full texture, orange marmalade flavor and acidity contrasting with a sweet toffee character.

63492,Coronica 2008 Gran Teran (Istria),"Grown in the mineral rich red soils of Istria, it has enticing aromas of fresh black raspberry, black cherry and black plum. Rich and full-bodied in the mouth, flavors recall fresh plums and ripe cranberries.",45.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
63879,LTU 2008 Malbec (Uco Valley),"LTU is superconcentrated, black as night, minerally, rich and wonderfully balanced.

63904,Hope Estate 2008 The Ripper Shiraz (Western Australia),"Hope Estate is headquartered near Australia's eastern coast, but this wine comes from a vineyard it owns way out west. It's a well-made, medium- to full-bodied Shiraz, boasting a raspberry flavor that's nicely accented by a dark coffee note and an approachable, open-knit texture. Drink it over the next year or two.",18.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
63905,Gimenez Riili 2008 Gran Reserva Limited Edition Malbec (Uco Valley),"Good but not excessively expressive on the bouquet, this reveals a milk chocolate element that emerges after the wine airs. The flavor profile starts with a lemony oak note, with notes of blackberry, herb and peppery spice underneath. The nice finish is modest, like the bouquet. Only 300 cases made.",68.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
63975,Viña Casas Patronales 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"True aromas of green fruit and grapefruit send it off in the right direction. For Maule SB, this is pretty lively and refreshing.

63977,Kirkland Signature 2008 Ti Point Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Loaded with passion fruit and pineapple, this is a crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc made for early consumption. It should fit the bill with shellfish or as a bracing apéritif this summer.",9.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
63980,MontGras 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Fresh and composed, with aromas of asparagus, mineral and citrus. The palate is mild and balanced, with green-infused flavors that hint at bell pepper, green apple and garden-fresh herbs. Slightly pithy and peppery on the tail end, but honest as Casablanca SBs go. Good for quaffing.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
63981,Palo Alto 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Shows a prickly side that's true to the variety. Smells and tastes slightly salinic, but also shows good verve and mouthfeel. This is a lively style of SB with citrus and green-apple flavors. It finishes with edgy gooseberry and seems committed to the crisp, lean style (even from warmer Maule Valley).",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
63984,RockBare 2008 Mojo Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"A solid, well-made Sauvignon Blanc from RockBare that combines aromas of melon rind and underripe nectarine with flavors of stone fruit and citrus, this is a nice wine, albeit not one that solves the mystery of what Austin Powers was missing in The Spy Who Shagged Me.",20.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
64044,Groom 2008 Bush Block Zinfandel (Barossa Valley),"No doubt informed by winemaker Daryl Groom's California experience, this is a fine example of Australian Zinfandel, marrying briary berry fruit with subtle herbal notes and hints of vanilla, cinnamon and clove.

64184,François Lurton 2008 El Albar Lurton Excelencia Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"An excellent effort given that 2008 was by no means an excellent vintage. This Tempranillo is loaded with alluring aromas of sous-bois, marzipan, cola, moss and black-fruit aromas. The feel is thorough and pure, with blackberry, black licorice, graphite and chocolate flavors. It's textured and deep, but not overly tannic or hard on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",55.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
64707,A. Parparoussis 2008 Les Dons de Dionysos Barrel Fermented Assyrtiko-Athiri White (Achaia),"A nose of fresh-cut flowers, tropical fruit and melon leads this barrel-fermented white blend . On the palate, the wine has a lovely floral character but lacks some of the minerality that gives Greek whites their lively touch. Pair with fish or cheeses.",25.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
65019,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2008 Dona Maria Amantis Reserva Red (Alentejano),"The combination of Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional brings a firm, dry character in this wine.

65438,Pauletts 2008 Polish Hill River Riesling (Clare Valley),"A rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so.",26.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
65502,Klabjan 2008 Refosk Refosco (Slovenska Istra),"An easy-drinking wine, it has pronounced aromas and flavors of cherry vanilla soda, blackberry preserves and just a touch of menthol.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
65557,Indomita 2008 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"There's a lot of individuality to this wine, just not all good. The nose has cigar box and over-the-top sweet and baked aromas, yet the palate has a grating, acidic feel but also spice and raisiny flavors. All of it makes you more confused than confident; it has its good traits but seems out of whack.",20.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
65564,Undurraga 2008 Aliwen Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Rapel Valley),"Leathery and horsey on the nose, with cherry fruit and warmth.

Quick and cleansing on the finish, with another wave of herbal flavor.",13.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
65657,Black Pearl 2008 Oro Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Paarl),"The '08 Oro is Cab dominant while the '07 favored Shiraz, a difference that seems to be an improvement. Rich and concentrated with lovely dark plum, cassis and black raspberry components coupled with accents of tree bark, sweet spice and soft cigar tobacco. Fresh and lush all at once; easy to drink now or can hold for a year or two.",18.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
65658,Clusserath-Weiler 2008 Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"The restrained nose shows some white peach notes, lees and stony minerality. This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish.",31.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
65660,Dr. Loosen 2008 Blue Slate Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Quite ripe and precise stone fruit aromas with interesting hints of minerality. Refreshingly crisp with balanced sweetness.

65661,Egon Müller 2008 Scharzhof Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"Prevailing lemony, citrus-cocktail aromas with hints of almond macaroons. Though medium sweet, it is lip-smackingly crisp and racy, with zesty citrus flavors following through on the palate. Moderately intense and reasonably taut, if a little austere.",25.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
65666,Porto Carras 2008 Malagouzia (Halkidiki),"This exotic white starts with aromas of white flowers, lemon and mint, followed by fuller-bodied flavors of peach, apricot and flowers. Balanced with a viscous mouthfeel. The wine is well-suited for robust dishes—think lobster—but also adds depth to simple grilled fish.",22.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
65670,Alta Vista 2008 Atemporal Red (Mendoza),"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",25.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
65965,Lagarde 2008 Altas Cumbres Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine. Drink throughout the winter and into 2010.",10.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
65967,Tapiz 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Fully roasted, leathery and meaty on the nose, but there's also coffee, mocha and late-coming berry fruit.

65971,St Hallett 2008 Riesling (Eden Valley),"Exceptionally intense, this is a wine for real aficionados of Australian Riesling. Stone and gravel tango with aromas of lime juice and coconut, all of which is underscored by a firm minerality. Long, dry finish. Delicious. Try with pork in a mustard sauce.",16.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
65973,Malat 2008 Höhlgraben Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A rounded wine, expressing its attractive, somehow creamy texture through apple and grapefruit flavors. It is poised, certainly not heavy, great as an apéritif wine.",29.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
66113,Achaval-Ferrer 2008 Quimera Red (Mendoza),"Smoke, leather and game aromas mix with blackberry, while the palate is juicy, with plenty of crispness. Like many A-F wines, Quimera, a blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, is tangy and lively.

66127,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2008 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Sweet, ripe, rich and a little baked on the bold bouquet, with a good mouthfeel, layered blackberry and plum fruit, and then a long, robust and clean finish.

66202,Lapostolle 2008 Clos Apalta Red (Colchagua Valley),"Clos Apalta, depending on your point of view, is arguably Chile's best wine. And this vintage is outstanding! Earth, minty spice, ripe berry, minerality and smoky aromas cover the bases. It's superbly structured, with a fine texture and depth.

66440,Quo 2008 Grenache (Campo de Borja),"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure.

66740,Saint Clair 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Although the stars at Saint Clair are the Reserve and Pioneer Block wines, the regular SB bottling has maintained a high level of quality.

67449,Oliverhill 2008 Jimmy Section Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Oliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee.

67503,Wrongo Dongo 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
67515,La Yunta 2008 Torrontés (La Rioja),"Fairly quiet on the nose, but there's just enough varietal character to help it along. The palate is fresh and zingy, with apple and apricot flavors in front of a clean, short, simple finish. Perfectly adequate white wine but that's about as far as it goes.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
67520,Nautilus 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"An atypically lean, focused Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with the emphasis on minerality and leafy components rather than tropical fruit.

67674,Callia 2008 Alta Malbec (Tulum Valley),"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",9.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
67770,Hafner 2008 Old Vienna Composition Ice Wine Eiswein Grand Cuvée Red (Burgenland),"A mildly oxidative streak adds an extra dimension to the rich dried fruit notes that are heady with Medjool dates, raisins and figs, cut though with the sharpness of orange zest. Molasses and dark muscovado sugar appear in the background and virtually beg for slices of gingerbread and fruitcake.",19.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
67787,Viu Manent 2008 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A little blocky and foxy at first, but the nose forges ahead with sweet, baked aromas that set up a saturated, dark-fruit palate of prune, sweet spice and fudge.

68041,Cluster M45 2008 Shiraz (Heathcote),"The result of a joint venture between the Chapoutier and Laughton families, this is a full-bodied, superripe wine.

68241,Al Zagal 2008 Rey Zagal Red (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada),"Dusty, earthy berry aromas veer toward raisiny. This is 80% Tempranillo and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon.

68417,Herdade das Servas 2008 Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),"While the aromas are earthy, with a farmyard character, the finely textured palate is fruitier.

68430,TerraNoble 2008 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Dark and charred like so many of TerraNoble's red wines. There's lemon peel, black coffee, black fruit and herbs on the nose, while the palate shows tomato, herbs, smoked meat, basic black fruit and a snappy texture. A little more racy than most, but heavily oaked and blackened.",18.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
68431,Casca Wines 2008 Monte Cascas Reserva Red (Alentejano),"For an Alentejo wine, this is surprisingly light, fresh and poised.

68435,Luna Beberide 2008 Finca La Cuesta Red (Bierzo),"Big, chunky and dark on the nose, but smells monotone except for a floral hint. The palate shows nice body, saturation and grabby tannins to go with oak-infused flavors of black plum, cola and spice. Savory and rooty on the finish. A good restaurant wine, either by the glass or bottle.",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
68464,Bodega Norton 2008 Reserva Merlot (Mendoza),"Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet.

68856,Plantagenet 2008 Omrah Shiraz (Great Southern),"A step up from the winery's entry-level Hazard Hill bottling, the 2008 Omrah Shiraz is another terrific value. It takes plummy fruit and cedary oak, then ups the ante with complex notes of smoked meat and leather while silky tannins line the long finish. Drink now–2020.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
68860,Ruca Malen 2008 Kinien de Don Raúl Red (Mendoza),"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is powerful, with a blueberry flavor, a mild green note, a balsamic hint and a molasses tinge. It's saturated and clampy in feel, with aggressive flavors of lemony oak, balsamic fruit and baked berry. Warm, oaky and full of licorice flavor on the finish. Drink 2014–2019.",65.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
68921,Penfolds 2008 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.",850.0,98,6,0.9960939822705477
69347,Bosman Family Vineyards 2008 Pinotage (Wellington),"Riper and richer than most Pinotage, with loads of decadent berry preserves, caramel sauce and melted dark chocolate aromas. The lushness carries through to the mouth, with a round mouthfeel full of dark fruit with accents of leather and cigar box. The peppery finish leaves a satisfying spicy note lingering in your mouth through the close.",45.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
69355,Bodega Catena Zapata 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",22.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
69356,Dr. Wehrheim 2008 Muschelkalk Trocken Weissburgunder (Pfalz),"A wine with an inviting nose of ripe fruit, layered with notes of honey and lovely, savory-earthy minerality. This is broad across the palate, with a smooth rich texture. Dry and fresh, featuring ample flavors of ripe orchard and stone fruit, with spice and balsamic notes adding complexity. Long length and a persistent savory finish.",37.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
69484,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2008 Los Vascos Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Attractive and very much in the vein of what is really good Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is all about green herbs, cactus pad, passion fruit and citrus. The palate transitions from lemon-lime to tropical pineapple and passion fruit, while the finish is breezy and zesty. It is a lean, 100% Casablanca style of SB, and while it's a step down from the great 2007, the drop is not a big one.",14.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
69485,Emiliana 2008 Novas Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Novas is probably more elevated and serious than Emiliana's basic Natura SB, but in the end run it's more or less a similar, high-quality white wine. After an opening that's tight and strained, Novas spreads out to show lime, passion fruit and green melon flavors. The feel is ripe and full, and it finishes grassy and green, with acid-driven length. Drink now for maximum freshness and intensity.",17.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
69491,Casas del Bosque 2008 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty.",14.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
69586,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Gaudium  (Rioja),"Compost, tomato leaf and gritty berry aromas control the nose on this underripe and tannic Rioja. Stalky flavors of tomato and berry fruits are definitively herbal, while the finish is toasty due to oak covering but also rough and stalky.",45.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
69629,Nollen 2008 Notorious Rooster Riesling (Mosel),"Pale lemony color. Classic Mosel nose of stone, slate, white peach and flower blossoms. Vibrant and crisp, balancing the sweetness on the palate and resulting in a wine with a juicy texture and moderate intensity, turning racy on the finish. Not overly complex, but refined.",10.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
69631,Dr. Wagner 2008 Ockfener Bockstein Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"The subtle nose features a medley of citrus fruits. Zesty lemon, grapefruit and tangerine flavors persist across the palate. Juicy and refreshing with an attractive midpalate creaminess adding weight and complexity. Smooth and long, with a nice mineral kick on the finish.",23.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
69914,Trapiche 2008 Iscay Malbec-Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor. Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now–2016.",50.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
69920,Finca Torremilanos 2008 Cyclo  (Ribera del Duero),"Despite the less-than-stellar vintage, this is excellent, with dark berry aromas, earthy grit and complexities that rise to the occasion. It feels big, fresh and fruity, with racy black-cherry, chocolate and pepper flavors. Elegant, correct and complete; drink now–2016.",58.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
70133,Chasing Venus 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Chasing Venus is made in textbook Marlborough style, with aromas and flavors of grassy herbs laid over passion fruit and gooseberries. It's medium in body, pleasantly soft and round in the mouth, just fades a bit rapidly on the finish.",16.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
70174,Mulderbosch 2008 Faithful Hound Red (Stellenbosch),"Brims with dark fruit notes of mulled boysenberry, cassis and black cherry, all streaked with spicy accents of menthol and black tea leaves. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but framed by medium tannins. Notes of licorice stick, espresso and roasted cocoa nibs linger through the long close. Drink now–2014.",22.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
70234,Babich 2008 Black Label Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Babich's top Sauvignon is a big step up in quality, featuring more weight and intensity than its regular bottling. Tropical--think passion fruit--flavors are accented by grassy notes, with grapefruit notes forming the core. Drink now.",18.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
70246,Cederberg 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Cederberg),"Fresh aromas of gooseberry and fig are followed by a flinty, fresh combination of flavors in Cederburg's Sauvignon Blanc. Balanced and robust, the wine has a snappy, citrus finish.",17.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
70375,Ricominciare 2008 Altísimo Cabernet Franc (Uco Valley),"Rubbery smelling at first, then earthy cherry and stewed fruit aromas emerge. Juicy and a bit pointed in terms of acidity, so it shocks the palate and pierces the cheeks. Tastes pulsing and ripe, with big red fruit flavors, candied sweetness, coconut and chocolate.",30.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
70411,Herdade do Esporão 2008 Esporão Private Selection Red (Alentejano),"From selected grapes, this is a powerful, complex wine. It has huge richness, tasting of the Alentejo sun. At the same time, the fruit is firm and structured, slowly revealing its fresher berry character to balance the density. The delicious juicy aftertaste promises a fine future for this wine. Drink from 2016.",60.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
70424,Royal Tokaji 2008 5 Puttonyos Aszú  (Tokaji),"Aromas of butterscotch, apricot preserves and vanilla caramel lead to flavors of quince preserves and apricot tart. Round in the mouth, it shows excellent structure and delights with refreshing acidity on the finish.",48.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
70522,Quinta da Zaralhôa 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.",60.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
70600,Chilensis 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Weak aromas of peach pit and tropical fruit are none too exciting, while the palate is dilute and carries flavors of orange and lime. Too narrow to warrant a recommendation, with barely any concentration.",12.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
70603,Emiliana 2008 Natura Gewürztraminer (Cachapoal Valley),"Progressive wineries like Emiliana enjoy experimenting, yet not all new wines are successful. A case in point: this sweet, warm, mushy Gewürztraminer from the Cachapoal Valley. Compared to global benchmarks, this is clumsy and sweet, with mealy apple and peach flavors. And it finishes candied and fat. Too much of a stretch, with no staying power.",11.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
70749,Cesca Vicent 2008 Abat Domènech Red (Priorat),"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.",49.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
70759,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Standard cherry and plum aromas are fresh, clean and unadulterated by heavy oak, leather or earth notes. Feels clean and dry, with nice but standard red-berry and plum flavors. Has good flow and feel, with a light dusting of spice on the finish.",15.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
70762,Nōmade 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Dry and unusual smelling, with baking spice, cinnamon and exotic notes. Not your normal black-fruited bruiser; this wine spreads out in the mouth, with sweet flavors of nutmeg along with dry plum and berry fruit. Lively and warm on the finish, with zest and an herbal element.",18.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
70770,Penley Estate 2008 Chertsey Red (Coonawarra),"In certain vintages, this wine can be excellent, but in 2008 it's merely good. The fruit—a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (49%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Merlot (19%)—comes across as slightly pruny or stewed, while the tannins remain firm and leathery.",50.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
70953,Solar de Libano 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Aromas of tobacco, vanilla and dried fruit take on a grassy note after airing in the glass. A cool, wet vintage for the region yields a slightly astringent and acidic palate. Flavors of dried plum, cherry and vanilla carry a tart streak, while the finish is both earthy and a bit sour.",35.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
71144,Viña Almirante 2008 Pionero Maccerato Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
71161,Concha y Toro 2008 Marques de Casa Concha Carmenère (Peumo),"Nice and aromatic, with cola, tobacco, fallen dried leaves and dark fruits. The palate has some scratch and acidity to it, but the flavors are good and lively, with a focus on dark plum and cherry. A bit more acidic than I like, but still healthy and very nice for varietal Carmenère.",22.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
71195,Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro),"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.",47.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
71252,Finca Casa Lo Alto 2008 Reserva Red (Utiel-Requena),"The cola and licorice aromas are candied and easygoing. This feels acidic and snappy, with red cherry and berry flavors that end with a crisp, sheer, rugged feel.",35.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
71306,Viña Costeira 2008 White (Ribeiro),"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",14.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
71612,Kouros 2008 Roditis (Patras),"Soft aromas of vanilla, melon and peach give this wine a pretty, subdued air. Appealing to fans of lighter whites, the wine still has a floral, filled out character that will pair well with spicy ethnic cuisine and sweeter fish dishes.",12.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
71637,Bodegas Ontañón 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"A dusty cherry aroma turns harsh with airing, setting up a tight, acidic palate that's marked by tart raspberry and plum flavors. Scouring, spicy and peppery on the finish, this amounts to a tight, hard and basic Rioja.",13.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
71709,Santa Carolina 2008 Herencia Carmenère (Peumo),"As Chilean Carmenère goes, this is one of the best and most true to the grape. Dusty, dry, earthy aromas of spiced berry, herbs and cocoa lead to a lofty palate with both creamy oak and driving acids. Oak-related flavors of vanilla and coconut sit on top of spicy, baked berry flavors, while the finish is full, woody, creamy and dense. Drink this excellent Carmenère now through 2017.",90.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
71961,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2008 Red (Beiras),"Dark-colored wine, a blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional, both of which lend their tannins to this still-young wine. It is dense with a firm, dry presence. The fruit is textured, structured, focused on weight and aging potential.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
71973,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Dead Letter Office Shiraz (McLaren Vale-Padthaway),"Although this starts off showing loads of vanilla and bright, boysenberry-like fruit, this is not a simple fruity concoction; there's some elegance here, and some savory notes of coffee and roasted meat as well. Drink this rich, full-bodied Shiraz over the next few years.",27.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
72008,Quanta Terra 2008 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Douro),"Very dry, the fruit losing some freshness with the wood aging. However the structure is firm and dark. With the acidity, this could be a wine for aging over 1–2 years.",34.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
72012,Dão Sul 2008 Grilos Red (Alentejano),"One of a pair of wines under the Grilos name, this Alentejo blend is soft and generous, its ripe berry fruits laced with licorice. Juicy and ready to drink.",11.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
72014,Doolhof 2008 Lady in Red Red (Wellington),"Black currant leaf and juicy plum guts abound on the nose of this Bordeaux-style blend, and those aromas transition into the dominating flavors of the palate alongside suggestions of pepper and sweet smoked meat. Balanced, with fine tannins and a clean but lingering finish.",19.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
72219,O. Fournier 2008 Centauri Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"When O. Fournier tackles a new project, such as Sauvignon Blanc from Leyda, it doesn't mess around. This is an excellent example of Chilean SB with green fruit, citrus and a light touch of capsicum. It's a serious wine that challenges with its peppery crispness offset by grapefruit and green melon. Very nice mouthfeel; shows itself in a couple of waves.",18.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
72229,3 Stones 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Richly fruited and tropical, this is a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Marlborough Savvy. Flavors hint at pineapple, honey and stone fruit, yet remain zesty and clean, with a refreshing citrus zing to the finish. Stock up for the summer.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72236,Kim Crawford 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc strums the right chords, combining notes of crushed tomato leaf with citrusy fruit to make a pretty melody. A hint of creaminesss rounds out the midpalate, and the wine finishes long, with pristine cleanliness.",19.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72250,Viña Mayor 2008 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak. This feels wide and tannic on the palate, with ripe, oaky flavors of berry, cassis, vanilla and licorice. A creamy palate is healthy and completes the wine in fine fashion; drink through 2020.",30.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
72323,Hungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate.

72331,Real Companhia Velha 2008 Quinta dos Aciprestes Red (Douro),"Big and ripe wine with sweet, jammy black fruits layered with new wood. The wine is powerful, to be sure, but it also has a stylish elegance from the interplay of fruit acidity and tannins.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72335,Real Companhia Velha 2008 Evel Reserva Red (Douro),"A big, sweet, fruity wine, with ripe tannins, mint and chocolate flavors from the wood aging. It is rounded, polished, full of black plums, spice and finishing with balanced acidity. Keep for 3–4 years.",35.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72469,Morandé 2008 House of Morandé Red (Maipo Valley),"Ripe blackberry, graphite, balsam wood, vanilla and kirsch aromas combine to provide a fine opening to this Cabernet-led blend. The palate is smooth and layered, with cherry, cassis, vanilla and herbal flavors. On the finish, it's a bit thick in feel, with moderate complexity. Drink now–2016.",50.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72482,Enrique Mendoza 2008 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Alicante),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz blend has a lot of personality and individuality. It's full of earthy tobacco and blackberry aromas, while the texture is nice and the volume is generous. Flavors of oak-driven vanilla and cream accent core berry flavors, while there's depth and length to the finish. Drink now.",40.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
72491,Trapiche 2008 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza),"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",12.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
72697,Viña Bujanda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas. Shows grip on the palate, along with the same flavors hinted at on the nose: leather, burnt coffee, herbs and roasted berries. Feels pretty good, but the stalky, burnt core dominates.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
73303,Knappstein 2008 Hand Picked Riesling (Clare Valley),"Captivating, with zesty lemon and wet stones on the nose, followed by a complex medley of citrus, passionfruit and carnations on the palate. The wine finishes well, with punchy notes of lime marmalade and dry chalk. Try with smoked trout. Drink now for its vibrant fruit or lay down for a few years for more honeyed depth.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
73309,Neil Ellis 2008 The Left Bank Red (Western Cape),"This full-bodied red from Neil Ellis starts with aromas of cherry, coffee and plum, leading into a fruity but balanced explosion of cherry, anise, black pepper and tobacco. Structured but still juicy, the wine will improve with age.",15.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
73314,Stadt Krems 2008 Wachtberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Creamy and rich, with flavors of almonds, apples and cream. Apricots steal in, along with honey and a vivid final tang of citrus zest. The minerality gives a powerful pull to the wine, offering the driest of finishes.",35.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
73316,Weinrieder 2008 Bockgärten Riesling (Niederösterreich),"A young, spicy wine, with white flower aromas. The acidity is as crisp as possible, the sweet currants adding bursts of fruit. This is a potentially serious wine, its elegance and structure promising good aging.",27.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
73847,Pagos del Moncayo 2008 Tinto Joven Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja),"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",17.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74013,Ventisquero 2008 Vertice Apalta Vineyard Carmenère-Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"This is a bold, fruity, muscular blend that's 100% New World in its darkness, ripeness and heft. It's earthy and full of cola and herbs on the nose, while the palate is rugged and delivers core blackberry, spice, coffee and herbal flavors. A dry, ripped, peppery tasting finish is a proper ending. Drink now–2017.",37.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
74060,Quo 2008 Old Vines Grenache (Campo de Borja),"Deep and earthy smelling, with meatiness, black fruit and hickory notes to the bouquet. The wine offers concentration and thickness, with ripe, slightly medicinal flavors of plum and blackberry. The same goes for the finish, and overall this is a medium-to-full Grenache that gets it done.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74062,Sierra Cantabria 2008 Organza White (Rioja),"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation. The blend is 65% Viura with Malvasia and white Garnacha, and overall it's a round, stout, creamy wine with apple, vanilla and toasty, resiny flavors and finishing notes. A little heavy and sticky but nice for barrel-aged white Rioja.",29.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74068,D'Arenberg 2008 d'Arrys Original Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale),"Probably because of its youth, this wine comes out of the chute a little tight and rubbery; try giving it a quick decanting, or swirl it aggressively in the glass to bring out the underlying cola and blackberry aromas and flavors. Turns slightly dusty on the finish, suggesting at least a few years' worth of drinkability.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74071,Finca Nueva 2008 Viura (Rioja),"From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw. The palate has spiced peach, apple and pear flavors, and the finish is exceedingly creamy and deep. Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74073,Volver 2008 Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Dark as night and thick, with heavy, modern aromas of shoe polish, bacon and ripe, roasted black fruits. The feel is concentrated and healthy, while the flavors run very ripe and dark, with plenty of oak thrown in. Finishes rich, with bacon, resin, black pepper and some burn. Seems more jacked up than its listed 14.5% alcohol.",16.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74105,Bodegas San Martín 2008 Ilagares Tinto Red (Navarra),"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product.",8.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
74106,Viña Cobos 2008 Felino Merlot (Mendoza),"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",19.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
74107,Torre Castillo 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",13.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
74108,Bodega San Pedro Apóstol 2008 Campellares  (Rioja),"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",12.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
74109,Bodegas Lomablanca 2008 Bardosa Tempranillo-Garnacha (Cariñena),"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",9.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
74110,Aromal 2008 Verdejo (Rueda),"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",15.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
74112,TorresManur 2008 Pindal Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",9.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
74128,Bodegas Corral 2008 Altos de Corral Barrel Fermented  (Rioja),"Initially this smells toasty to the point of charred, but with airing the nose settles on oak, black fruit and lightly stemmy red-berry scents. This feels full and good, with resolved tannins that don't bite. Flavors of black fruits and coconut oak finish strong and deep. This can last until 2025, maybe longer.",32.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
74232,Marqués de Legarda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Raspberry, chocolate and plum aromas form a basic bouquet. This shows tight grip along with flavors of baked berry fruits, leather and earth. The finish tastes a bit rubbery, and then heat and dry, peppery notes take over.",16.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
74256,Casa Primicia 2008 T Crianza  (Rioja),"With can't-miss aromas of vanilla, dill and leathery cherry, this starts out in textbook form for a Rioja crianza. The palate is just round enough, with initial dark-berry flavors followed by numerous waves of bold oak that finish in a pool of dill, mint and spice flavors.",21.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
74527,Marqués de Riscal 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Dry, fresh aromas of red fruits come across crisp and racy. The palate follows the nose's lead with medium weight and traditional snappy acidity. Flavors of plum, berry and cassis are clean, while the finish shows some richness via molasses and oaky notes.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74686,Herdade do Esporão 2008 Esporão Reserva Red (Alentejo),"Something of a disappointment in this vintage, a wine that has an awkward bitter character. The wine is fine enough, with rich berry fruits, but misses the style of previous vintages.",25.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
74739,François Lurton 2008 Hacienda Araucano Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Strange and wayward right from the get go. The nose is herbal and foxy, and the the flavor profile is downright odd, with a dull, grapey bitterness, funk and herbal qualities. Not what we call good Carmenère.",13.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
74759,R Wines 2008 Marquis Philips Merlot (South Eastern Australia),"Full-bodied, lush and creamy in texture, this Merlot epitomizes the Marquis Philips style. There's a coating of charred oak, superripe fruit and plenty of size without much acid or tannin. Drink this slightly warm (16.5% abv) wine over the next 6–9 months.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74766,Bodegas Silvano Garcia 2008 Viña Honda Red (Jumilla),"A blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah that's ripe and raisiny but still fresh enough to earn its stripes. The nose is powerful and intense, with a sweet, baked character, while the palate tastes naturally rich but restrained, with blackberry and jammy finishing notes.",14.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
74920,Viu Manent 2008 Secreto Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Opens with sweet, candied fruit and herb aromas. The palate is aggressive and fairly tannic, while the palate rattles about with herbal wild berry, coffee and burnt flavors. Definitely lively and forward, but also rough and slightly drying and bitter on the finish.",14.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74925,Sur de los Andes 2008 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74931,Santa Rita 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Marshmallow sweetness and oak aromas give it a confected nose, while the mouth is weighty, concentrated and sappy, with mildly raspy berry and plum flavors. More spicy than herbal, with sweetness and forward oak on the finish. A full-force wine, but one that's fairly basic.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74933,Concha y Toro 2008 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Malbec (Rapel Valley),"A bold and chunky customer with multiple personalities. The nose has big black fruit, smoke, leather, barrel char and even some wet dog smells, while the palate is easygoing and full, with herbal, roasted fruit and spice. Long and mostly true on the finish. Uncomplicated but solid.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74934,Concha y Toro 2008 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Like most Casillero varietals, this Merlot offers good concentration and a mix of berry fruit and light herbal aromas. The palate is lively, with good acidity and zesty red plum and pie cherry flavors. It's a little tangy throughout but on the plus side it's not overdone or heavy.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74936,Montes 2008 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"A bulky wine with aromas of dried herbs, pepper and black fruits. It's meaty and thick in the mouth, with grapey, herbal flavors. Unfolds fairly nicely on the finish, with the wine's herbal character locking in. A good example of Chilean Malbec that's more basic than complex.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
74948,Gracia de Chile 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"A stocky, meaty style of Carmenère, with earthy aromas and then sweet, choppy flavors of cherry, plums and herbs. Turns more herbal on the back side, with carob and briar on the long, fairly consistent finish. Middle-of-the-road wine that stands up to scrutiny.",12.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
74973,Vega Sicilia 2008 Valbuena  (Ribera del Duero),"Cranberry and currant aromas come with hints of herbs and juniper. An astringent initial mouthfeel turns more complex with airing.

74997,Ramón Bilbao 2008 Mirto  (Rioja),"Coffee, mocha, char and roasted black-fruit aromas control the bouquet on this modern Rioja. Lemony acidity provides lift to the palate, which has a raw, abrasive, tannic bite. Flavors of toast, chocolate, lemon rind and black fruits finish similarly, with a chewy texture. Drink through 2018.",70.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
75003,Castra Rubra 2008 Via Diagonalis Red (Thracian Valley),"Big boned and brawny, this is a lushly textured wine full of intensely ripe black plum and cherry flavors. It's richly fruity, but textured with velvety tannins, crushed granite notes and a hit of acidity that lingers on the finish. A blend of Bulgarian and international grape varieties.",17.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
75023,Viña Las Perdices 2008 Reserva Don Juan Red (Luján de Cuyo),"Leather and earth aromas are just part of the meaty, roasted, lightly charred bouquet. The palate is thick and jammy, with savory, roasted flavors of berry fruit, pepper and leather. Finishes with chocolate and a fine texture. Impressive despite having a light herbal streak. 500 cases made.",23.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
75090,Agustín Cubero 2008 Unus Syrah (Calatayud),"A soupy sort of wine with raisiny aromas. It tastes salty and feels astringent, with tomato, herb and brothy flavors. The mouthfeel is the best part.",9.0,81,6,0.9960939822705477
75099,Ignacio Marín 2008 Duque de Medina Reserva Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena),"Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.",14.0,80,6,0.9960939822705477
75108,Alvaro Castro 2008 Pape Red (Dão),"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil. Pape is a top wine from Alvaro Castro made predominantly from Touriga Nacional. Perfumed, elegant and structured, with plenty of concentration, this is a wine for serious aging.",65.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477
75264,Diemersfontein 2008 Pinotage (Wellington),"The label reads “The Original coffee/chocolate Pinotage” and boy are they right! This is pure decadent bliss with intense aromas of crème de cacao, raspberry chocolate sauce and coffee granules along with hints of hickory bacon and tobacco. The mouth is huge, ripe and full, with a balanced structure and gorgeous flavors of juicy mashed black raspberries, plum flesh, sweet smoked meat and mocha that leads strongly throughout the lengthy finish. With 500 cases imported, this is a Pinotage worth searching out and trying.",20.0,91,6,0.9960939822705477
75266,Grosset 2008 Springvale Riesling (Clare Valley),"Like some of the other 2008s, this wine seems to be evolving rapidly—a common enough occurence in hot vintages. Apple and citrus flavors still dominate, but the wine is already showing hints of honey and toast. Drink it now and over the next 3–5 years.",38.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
75313,Pavlidis 2008 Thema Red (Drama),"Anise, blackberry, black pepper and savory spice aromas lead this ripe red from Pavlidis. The palate is laced with a vanilla note, and the red berry flavors are rich and easy to like. With its good spice and complex fruit, this should pair well with grilled meats and tomato pastas.",30.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
75327,L.A. Cetto 2008 Private Reserve Petite Sirah (Valle de Guadalupe),"Smooth ripe-fruit aromas of raisin and blackberry lead to a jammy feel and concentrated palate that's home to baked black-fruit and molasses flavors. A gritty, grippy finish holds its form. Drink now.",20.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
75557,Vidigal 2008 NBNC Red (Lisboa),"A smoothly textured wine that shows red-berry flavors, with very soft tannins along with a farmyard character. It feels ripe and fruit; a fine barbecue wine.",10.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
75566,Llama 2008 Old Vine Malbec (Mendoza),"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.",15.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
75575,Four Aces 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
75815,Chono 2008 Reserva Syrah (Elqui Valley),"Aromas of sweet black cherry, cough drop and smoke work well together and draw you in. The palate is full and pretty smooth, with black plum, blackberry and creamy oak flavors. It's just spicy and interesting enough to earn a Best Buy recommendation. Best if you like sweet, ripe Syrahs.",13.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76051,Don Miguel Gascón 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.",14.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
76052,Emina 2008 Selección Personal Verdejo (Rueda),"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.",36.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
76113,Frano Milos 2008 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),"Aeration is key to deciphering the layers of barnyard, leather, earth and tannin that dominate the attack of this brawny, bold wine. With time, a multitude of delicate red-fruit, flower and hay notes unfold, contributing a feminine flair that's elegantly appealing.",25.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76167,Pago de Valdetruchas 2008 Los Cerezales Mencía (Bierzo),"A little prickly and sharp on the nose, with cherry, raspberry and piney aromas. The palate is racy, healthy and solid, with wild herb notes giving character to more basic but ripe blackberry and oak-based coffee flavors. Finishes long and whole, with a final dusting of dried herbs.",22.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
76170,St Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz (Barossa),"Full bodied and supple, this nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that value still exists even in big-name regions of Australia. Intense blueberry and spice aromas give way to mixed berries and vanilla on the palate, and if it's not overly complex, it's a still a concentrated mouthful of Shiraz at a bargain price.",13.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
76178,García Figuero 2008 Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",29.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
76232,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Château Julia Merlot (Drama),"The nose on this layered Merlot offers dark cherry, cocoa and spice aromas. Cedar, cigarbox, cherry and chocolate on the palate are balanced with a clean, chalky mouthfeel. The wine can age but has appeal now, and a serious focus.",26.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76313,Kiss Chasey 2008 Shiraz (Margaret River),"This well priced wine offers typical Shiraz aromas and flavors, ranging from cherries to black olives and weaving in some smoky and tarry accents. It's medium-bodied, with a plump feel but also a firmly tannic backbone that would serve it well alongside steak, chops or burgers.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76422,Vinha Paz 2008 Reserva Red (Dão),"With its intense black color and perfumed aromas, this is a superb wine. The palate is firm, solid, still tannic, with the fruit just coming into balance. Nineteen months of wood aging has rounded the wine without dominating. Give this seriously ageworthy wine 5–6 years.",35.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
76424,Numanthia 2008 Termanthia  (Toro),"Lush and classy, with earthy blackberry, hard spice, chocolate and lemon peel aromas. The palate is a mile deep and tannic, but it's not too hard or mean, and it tastes fantastic, with ripe blackberry, chocolate, spice and toast flavors. Complex and masculine, with tobacco and woodspice on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016.",200.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
76429,Fiuza 2008 Ikon Chardonnay/Trincadeira White (Tejo),"Aromatic, tropical textured wine. Great flavors of ripe pineapple and mango balance with more green fruit characters and a twist of lime. The wood flavors are well restrained, offering just a touch of final spice.",25.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
76433,Durham-Agrellos 2008 Marka Reserva Red (Douro),"An impressive wine, with spice, intense ripe black berry fruits and a solid core of tannins. It has power without being overwhelming, densely textured and ready to age for several years.",39.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
76532,R&A; Pfaffl 2008 Austrian Pepper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Fresh apple and pear flavored wine, very creamy, toasty almost, with only just a pinch of pepper to go with the richness of the fruit.

76705,Santa Helena 2008 Vernus Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"A little oaky and leathery at first, but as a whole this wine sings a nice song.

76708,Santa Carolina 2008 Dry Farming Specialties Carignan (Cauquenes Valley),"Black olive and lightly baked berry and cassis aromas honestly reflect the wine's Cauquenes old-vines roots. The mouth is tight, granular and jammy, with bold flavors of raisin, plum and berry. This is pretty rich and red-fruited, with a sweet side and controlled medicinal touches.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76711,Giant Mistake 2008 Red (Coastal Region),"Despite the name, purchasing this wine is definitely not a giant mistake. For the price, this red blend offers loads of rich berry preserve flavors matched assertively with coffee, chocolate and caramel accents. The palate is smooth but the tannins hang on firmly through the close.",20.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
76764,Niepoort 2008 Bioma Vinha Velha Vintage  (Port),"A very dry Port, the tannins concentrating the fruit into a tight, mineral ball. Even if the fruit is suppressed at this stage, it will show through in years to come, leaving a structured but rich wine.",90.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
76770,Herdade do Esporão 2008 S Syrah (Alentejano),"Even the stain on the base of the cork reveals this wine's huge color. With its open richness and structure, it's comparable to a Rhône wine. Wood aging has lended notes of spice to go with the flavors of plum jelly and ripe, sweet fruit.",35.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
76776,Concha y Toro 2008 Gravas del Maipo Syrah (Buin),"Opaque in color, with a driving bouquet loaded with graphite, pastry and incredibly ripe black-fruit aromas.

76897,Pascual Toso 2008 Alta Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Malbec (Maipú),"Slightly dry and scratchy on the nose, and definitely fully oaked in the Toso style. But once it settles deeper, black fruit notes escape. The palate is snappy and juicy due to 2008's cool harvest conditions, and the flavors are a mix of plum, berry and woodiness. Long and oaky on the finish; drink now through 2013.",35.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
77106,Mud House 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A lush, tropical style of Sauvignon, combining peach and guava aromas with passion fruit flavors. This is delicious right now for its immediate fruit, ample weight and slightly creamy texture.",15.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
77107,Barker's Marque 2008 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Passion fruit and nectarine aromas are joined by hints of jalapeno, while the palate displays stone fruit flavors with tropical overtones and grassy accents.

77316,Vertijana 2008 3 Red (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada),"This Tempranillo-led blend from southern Spain opens with a lot of oak on top of mature berry and graphite aromas. A lively, juicy palate features drying tannins, while wood-spice and berry flavors filter into a barrel-dominated finish. Drink now.",19.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
77398,Shoofly 2008 The Freckle White (Adelaide),"A Rhône-inspired blend of Marsanne (40%), Roussanne (37%) and Viognier (23%), this comes across as rather broad in the mouth, but lacking depth and length. Melon, pear and almond notes make a favorable impression, and the wine finishes fresh, if somewhat simple.",14.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
77482,Viu Manent 2008 Estate Collection Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Starts out with grassy, gamy aromas that are not up to what I've tasted from Viu Manent. This wine is bulky but also clumsy and regular at best. It has a simple, grassy set of generic berry flavors followed by a heavy finish. Granted, it's $9, so with tempered expectations it's not a deceiver.",9.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
77486,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Palma Reserva Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Mild vinegar and full-fledged herbal aromas are typical of traditional Chilean Merlot, and while the palate is solid, it's also scratchy, with tart raspberry and semiweedy flavors. Finishes with burnt brown sugar, herbal flavors and grating acidity.",10.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
77488,Palo Alto 2008 Reserva Red (Maule Valley),"Aromas of tobacco, molasses and damp moss suggest earthiness, yet the palate is piercing and high-wire, with bright, almost blinding acidity pushing cherry and red plum flavors. Kind of gritty on the finish, where the tannins and acids combine.",13.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
77494,Espiritu de Chile 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Smells a little too much like nail polish and cherry candy, while the acidic palate has a wiry mouthfeel and herbal, brambly red fruit flavors. Finishes herbal, with some carob. A snappy, simple-at-best wine.",9.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
77495,Viña Tarapacá 2008 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Aggressive early on, with foxy, briary aromas of turned earth, olive, rhubarb and green tobacco. The palate is fleshy, soft and welcoming, but the flavors are a sketchy amalgam of bramble, leather and herbal raspberry. Mouthfeel is the best part.",19.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
77720,Pagos del Moncayo 2008 Tinto Joven Garnacha-Syrah (Campo de Borja),"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",17.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
77724,Pazo de Barrantes 2008 Pazo Barrantes Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",19.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
77879,Camberley 2008 Philosophers' Stone Red (Stellenbosch),"Herbal notes mingle with aromas of kirsch, violet, tobacco and tanned hide. Sweet spice and pepper unfold on the palate, integrating seamlessly with the black fruit flavors. The structure is firm but not too tough or unapproachable now, with medium acidity and a long, lingering finish.",24.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
77888,Casa Cadaval 2008 Vinha Padre Pedro Red (Tejo),"Licorice and dark chocolate flavors emerge with firm tannins cutting through the balanced fruit and acidity. Flavors are also of black cherry, damson and perhaps mineral. The wine needs decanting.",12.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
77993,Beau Joubert 2008 Shiraz (Stellenbosch),"Delicate mint aromas play alongside notes of bittersweet cocoa powder, dried blackberry and date.

78079,Maetierra Dominum 2008 QP Reserva  (Rioja),"An attractive mix of spiced plum, fresh tomato, herb, tobacco and vanilla aromas are the intro to this excellent wine from a not-good vintage. The palate is creamy but vital, with roasted plum, integrated oak and savory flavors. A smooth but intense finish brings this home. Drink through 2019.",25.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
78087,Muga 2008 Rosé (Rioja),"After many years of singing the praises of Muga's rosé, this vintage seems lacking and sour. The nose is short and quiet, while the palate delivers lean, citric flavors and a sharp, scouring finish. Whets the whistle, but doesn't put a smile on your face.",12.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
78100,Casa de Campo 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),"Tart, lean red fruit aromas don't give much reason to plow forward, but if you do expect a high-acidity wine with a snappy mouthfeel and flavors of rhubarb, red plum and raspberry. Not much body or anything else, really.",9.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
78109,Pago de los Capellanes 2008 Joven Roble  (Ribera del Duero),"Smells like a dog badly in need of a bath, and alongside those funky aromas there's berry fruit and bubblegum. The palate is forceful and sort of heavy and tannic, with herbal, semitart plum flavors. Bright and lively, but unsophisticated, with poor aromas.",20.0,82,6,0.9960939822705477
78150,Alvear 2008 de Añada Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles),"Light brown and slightly translucent in color. Aromas lean toward raisin and prune, but there's orange zest and molasses on the bouquet as well. Bores straight ahead on the palate, with sweet flavors of burnt brown sugar, caramel and prune. Satisfying and balanced even if it's not overly complex.",23.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
78158,Galil Mountain 2008 Yiron Red (Galilee),"Attractive and layered with a blueberry and raspberry fruit core accented by notes of sweet spice, orange oil, ashy tobacco and a touch of dark purple florals. The gripping tannins are fine and balanced, with skin-driven fruit flavors dominating the palate and a fudgy chocolate and sweet spice note lingering on the finish.",22.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
78243,Montecillo 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Baked, earthy aromas of berry fruits are mature. This feels a bit rubbery and raw, with grabby tannins. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits are limited in scope, while the finish is mature, sweet tasting and disjointed in feel.",16.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78284,Malondro 2008 Red (Montsant),"Stalky, grassy, briny aromas of red-berry fruits run low on ripeness. This is tangy and tomatoey in feel, with tart plum and tomato flavors. A snappy, zesty, crisp finish is raw and cutting. Drink this wine now.",25.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78486,Giaconda 2008 Warner Vineyard Shiraz (Victoria),"With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now–2025.",100.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
78660,Quinta do Portal 2008 Vintage  (Port),"Perfumed, fresh, attractive wine. It feels light in character, the texture open, showing jelly fruit character as well as ripe fruit. There is a perfumed rosehip aftertaste.",60.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
78683,Señorio de Uñuela 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Chunky aromas of sweet berry and beets announce a ripe style of Rioja. The mouthfeel is medium to full and healthy, with focused flavors of berry, oak and peppery spice. Long and a little fiery on the finish.",14.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
78685,Tango Reàl 2008 Gran Reserva Malbec,"Plum and berry aromas are straightforward, but also clean and nice. The palate on this wine from San Rafael is focused and orderly, with flavors of red fruits, spice and mild woody notes. Long lasting on the finish, with freshness and just a modicum of tannic bite.",25.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
78836,Scala Dei 2008 Prior Red (Priorat),"Bacon, rubber and berry fruit aromas comprise the bouquet. Feels crisp on the palate, with roasted berry flavors and herb and pepper accents. It feels warm on the finish, with herbal leanings and some roughness.",27.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78840,Xabec 2008 Red (Montsant),"This is big and bacony on the nose, with herbal berry aromas and notes of spice and more. It feels lifted and nervy, with vital, almost volatile acidity and resiny, oak-led flavors of vanilla and black fruit. This is minty, spicy and aggressive on the finish.",24.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78957,Cono Sur 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Straightforward punchbowl aromas greet you, and beyond that there's melon to the nose. The palate is decidedly softer and rounder than Cono Sur's higher-tier SBs, while the flavors run toward familiar lemon and green apple. Finishes sweet but comfortable. Perfectly good and competent.",13.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78959,Omaka Springs 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A pleasant change of pace from the usual Marlborough recipe of tropical fruit and herbal tang, this offering instead supplies copious amounts of citrusy aromas and flavors coupled to a hint of stony minerality. It's round in the mouth, just fading away a bit quickly on the finish.",18.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78960,Otuwhero 2008 O:TU Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Pungent upfront, marrying freshly cut grass with hints of sweat and backing those scents up with bright citrus fruit. Flavors are musky and complex, adding fig and melon to the mix, all carried by a plump texture and a moderately long finish.",16.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
78963,San Pedro 2008 35° South Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Opens with aromatics of jalapeño, fresh lettuce, green apple and white pepper. The body is lithe and dances across the palate, while flavors of tangerine, Yellow Delicious apples and passion fruit are clean, light and familiar. An easygoing, likable and honest style of Sauvignon Blanc.",9.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
79008,Simonsig 2008 Pinotage (Stellenbosch),A light and somewhat racy Pinotage with good vibrancy to the strawberry and ripe pomegranate seed notes throughout. A kiss of vanilla on the close adds a touch of decadence to this otherwise straightforward wine.,15.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79009,Sumarroca 2008 Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Smells a bit stalky and burnt, with green, herbal aromas like rosemary and thyme popping up. The palate is sharper than most, with high acidity and angularity supporting a mix of citrus, grass and burnt, gaseous aromas. Finishes stalky, with lemon-lime notes.",22.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79010,Torres 2008 Sangre de Toro Tempranillo (Catalunya),"Pointy and sharp at first, with earthy, dry aromas. Edgy feeling, with heat and scour to go with peppery, herbal berry flavors. Finishes mossy and warm, with a minty burn. Improves with airing.",12.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79024,Marqués de Elciego 2008 Selección  (Rioja),"Concentrated and smoky, with shoe polish and other black aromas. It's ultratight in the mouth, collapsing on itself more than expanding. Flavors of earth and berry are loud. Rugged feeling on the finish.",24.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
79030,Tacama 2008 Quantum Petit Verdot (Ica),"Heavy on the bouquet, with baked, rustic black fruit aromas that turn cheesy and leathery with airing.

79284,Viña Vilano 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",16.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
79285,Muga 2008 Barrel Fermented Viura (Rioja),"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",16.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
79299,Dinastía Vivanco 2008 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de  (Rioja),"Raisin, licorice and coconut aromas produce a ripe bouquet. This is raw and screechy in the mouth, with little in the way of a midpalate. Flavors of heavy red-berry fruits have a green leaning, while the finish is raw in feel and reedy in flavor.",90.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79499,Benegas 2008 Juan Benegas Malbec (Mendoza),"Opens with blackberry aromas, earth and spice notes. There's a shock of core acidity to the palate that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Flavors of black cherry and black currant are jammy and on the sweet side, and the finish has a cookie dough quality along with lasting sweetness.",14.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
79513,Kangarilla Road 2008 Black St. Peters Zinfandel (McLaren Vale),"Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.",30.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
79575,Deakin Estate 2008 Moscato (Victoria),"Grassy and slightly pungent, showing the distinct aromas of underripe Muscat, but the delicate texture—it's lightly sparkling—and sweet flavors win out on the palate, balanced by a fresh, citrusy finish.",9.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
79579,Teal Lake 2008 Sparkling Kosher Muscat (South Eastern Australia),"Slightly grassy and pungent on the nose, but this sweet, fizzy Muscat turns more charming on the palate, where hints of pineapple and underripe citrus help to balance out the considerable sugar. Finishes fresh and soft at the same time. Drink now.",15.0,84,6,0.9960939822705477
79612,Viña Alicia 2008 Coleccion de Familia Brote Negro Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"This small-production Malbec is superb. The bouquet smells mossy, earthy, dense and loaded with smooth berry aromas. It's lush, deep and well balanced on the palate, with powerful black-fruit flavors along with fudge, tobacco and cola notes. The feel, flavors and length are all top quality. Drink now–2018; only 230 cases were made.",90.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
79624,Carmen 2008 Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Spicy and jumpy smelling, with red fruit aromas. The palate is alert, upright and tangy, with both citrus and red raspberry flavors. Reasonably good in terms of mouthfeel, with a light, herbal finish. A bit lean but exceedingly fresh.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79630,Pratsch 2008 Gemischter Satz White (Niederösterreich),"The name Gemischter Satz means a field blend of grapes, often old and rare varieties, an Austrian tradition. The wine is light, fresh and crisp, with just a slight prickle on the tongue. There is a creamy character, lying well with the spicy element. Screwcap.",21.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
79839,Ermita Veracruz 2008 Verdejo (Rueda),"Crisp on the bouquet, with green apple and controlled fresh celery aromas. The palate is also fresh, with basic roundness, bounce and natural flavors of apple cider, citrus and lime. Finishes with a slice of white grapefruit and a tiny spot of pith. Drink immediately.",18.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
79841,Pazo das Tapias 2008 Alma de Blanco Godello (Monterrei),"A little heavy and sweet on the nose, but juicy and deep on the palate, with round, pleasant lemon, grapefruit and green melon flavors. Dry, pure and driving white wine with a long, clean finish. Galician Godello in good form.",15.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
79850,Undurraga 2008 T.H. Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Undurraga's top Sauvignon hails from the premier terroir of Leyda. It smells clean and inviting, with an aromatic mix of talcum powder, lime, mango and scallion. The palate is very fresh and lively, with snappy citrus flavors that include grapefruit. Razor-clean on the finish.",22.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
79856,Beau Joubert 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),"A complex palate and lingering finish give this wine serious appeal. Tropical fruit aromas and a combination of minerals and lush fruit in the mouth offer elegant balance. The wine has a delicious, mouthcoating appeal but still offers a spin of fresh, clean flavors. Versatile with food—from rich to spicy.",14.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
79861,Quintay 2008 Clava Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Very nicely done for a new brand that we haven't seen before. This is Chilean SB in fine form. It's a mix of green and ripe fruits both on the nose and palate. Aromas of gooseberry and mango are alluring, and in the mouth it bounces along on a wave of bracing acidity. Elegant and easier toprocess than Quintay's more pungent, angular and demanding Reserva.",11.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
80026,Bodegas Ateca 2008 Atteca Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud),"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",16.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
80057,Wakefield 2008 Shiraz (Clare Valley),"Supple at first, with brown sugar and prune flavors that seem sweetly ripe, but this full-bodied wine firms up substantially on the finish, where it turns a bit leathery in flavor and coffee-astringent. Drink now, before the fruit fades.",17.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
80060,Morambro Creek 2008 Shiraz (Padthaway),"Solid, workmanlike Shiraz, offering a mélange of caramelized berries, tobacco and cassis. Seems warm but at the same time slightly austere, making it a good candidate to partner grilled steak. Drink now.",20.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
80134,D'Arenberg 2008 The Laughing Magpie Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale),"Starts off dark and a bit brooding, with aromas of plum, espresso and black olive, but shows hints of brighter fruit elements on the palate. Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.",29.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
80243,KWV 2008 Merlot (Western Cape),"Herbal and spicy, here's an easygoing Merlot that's perfect for entertaining. Pepper and anise add character to the black fruit core, and the pronounced acidity keeps things lively and clean on the finish.",11.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80256,Caves Transmontanas 2008 Vértice Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"The wine feels huge, showing its alcohol—maybe too much—with a touch of pepper. The black plum fruit flavors are fully ripe with only a hint of acidity.",35.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80429,Ysios 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),"Cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and direct. This is a straightforward aged Rioja with grabby tannins but enough body and fruit to absorb them. Baked cherry and plum flavors are a touch rustic and stalky, while a roasted aftertaste sends this on its way. Drink through 2019.",33.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
80459,Simone 2008 Winemaker's Collection Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Starts out kind of murky and pasty, with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell, and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble. Good enough, but doesn't do much to push the envelope that is Chilean Syrah.",15.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80467,Lobster Reef 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This bargain-priced offering combines tobacco leaf with Green Gage plum in a medium-bodied format. The flavors aren't quite as fresh and vibrant as the best examples, but it'll more than do for many occasions.",10.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80469,Matariki 2008 Aspire Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"Combines slightly pungent herbal notes with passion fruit and pineapple in a chunky, assertively fruity style that lacks a bit of elegance.",15.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80470,Painted Wolf 2008 Pinotage (Swartland),"A straightforward and vibrant Pinotage with notes of red cherry, raspberry, clove and cocoa. The palate is lively and fresh with medium acidity and a firm structure.",15.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80472,Riparian 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Costco's private-label Sauvignon Blanc is priced right and offers a fruity mouthful of melon and gooseberry flavor. The citrusy finish is a bit short, but pleasant.",7.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80473,Thatched Hut 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",19.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80539,Bodegas Palacio 2008 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja),"Cedar cigar box and berry aromas become significantly more charred and toasted upon airing. It feels good, with plum, berry and plenty of burnt toast in the flavor package. It finishes dark and spicy, with a leftover burnt note.",13.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
80556,Besllum 2008 Red (Montsant),"Robust on the bouquet, with ample red berry fruit and vanilla. The palate has a deep, layered feel and flavors of plum, berry and peppery spice. A tight blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah that's forward and wiry, with power in reserve. Drink now through 2015.",32.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
80571,Yarra Yering 2008 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley),"Dry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.",95.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477
80572,Kilikanoon 2008 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific example of Barossa Shiraz. From its smoky aromas and intense, briary scents to its complex, earthy, spicy flavors with an undercurrent of blackberry, this is a complete package. The long finish is slightly chewy, suggesting that additional aging is warranted. Drink 2016–2025.",104.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
80588,Castillo Clavijo 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.",13.0,87,6,0.9960939822705477
80705,Agustí Torelló Mata 2008 Brut Reserva Rosat Trepat (Cava),"Dusty and smooth upfront, this has attractive orange, nectarine and cream aromas. It feels layered and balanced, with cantaloupe, orange and milk chocolate flavors vying for attention. Mild but composed on the finish, this is made entirely from Trepat.",25.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
80723,Iby 2008 Chevalier Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"This is dry and firm—its tannins immediately noticeable. There are hints of juicy acidity in the background, but this solid, dense and serious wine is unlikely to soften much more. Pair with winter stews and rich meat dishes.",45.0,89,6,0.9960939822705477
80869,Maximo 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Berry fruit and mild leather open this good little bargain. There's adequate body and fullness, some oak, and then bright, fresh berry, herb and spice flavors. Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.",8.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
80871,Lar de Sotomayor 2008 Joven  (Rioja),"Light in color, with a candied, red fruit nose that's sweet and not very oaky. The palate is juicy but simple, with flavors of herbal raspberry and spice. Not overly complex but good due to its fresh, floral outlook.",18.0,85,6,0.9960939822705477
80927,Covila 2008 II Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Ripe, loamy raisin and kirsch aromas set up a pinched clampy tannic palate that grabs like Velcro. This tastes of vanilla and creamy oak along with herbal red berry fruits. Resiny, vanilla-driven flavors crowd out residual berry fruit on the finish. Drink now.",31.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
80977,Torres 2008 Grans Muralles Red (Conca de Barberà),"Loamy berry and saucy notes make for a complex bouquet, while the mouthfeel on this Catalonian blend is smooth, round, precise and structured. Flavors of ripe plum, herbs, licorice and savory spices finish dark, chunky and deep, with lasting cocoa and cherry notes that suggest warmth and richness. Drink through 2019.",150.0,93,6,0.9960939822705477
81091,Thorn Clarke 2008 St Kitts Vineyard on Truro Volcanic Soil Malbec (Barossa Valley),"A dark, inky purple in color, this is a full-bodied (15.5% alcohol) but gentle Malbec, its vanilla, plum and black olive notes framed by supple tannins and a velvety finish. Drink it over the next several years.",30.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
81097,Coriole 2008 Sangiovese - Shiraz Red (McLaren Vale),"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.",16.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
81102,Antigal 2008 Uno Malbec (Mendoza),"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.",20.0,90,6,0.9960939822705477
81124,Agustí Torelló Mata 2008 Magnum Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Crisp clean white-fruit aromas come with a hint of clover. This is mellow and mature on the palate, with nothing aggressive or edgy. Dry, peppery, yeasty flavors show little overt fruit, while this offers a hint of green melon on a dry complex finish.",150.0,92,6,0.9960939822705477
81209,Berberana 2008 Viña Alarde Crianza  (Rioja),"Raw aromas of rhubarb and scratchy raspberry offer little to latch onto. The palate feels clipped and angular, while the flavors are a touch stalky and generic as far as red fruit goes. This finishes tangy and scouring.",15.0,83,6,0.9960939822705477
81529,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Opens with true citrus, nettle and other snappy, prickly aromas. Like many Chilean SBs, it's fresh and charging, with zesty green-fruit and citrus flavors. Lime is present on the finish, as is a touch of lasting bitterness. Good but straightforward, and slightly narrow.",12.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
81535,Casas del Bosque 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Whispy and lightweight on the nose, with hints of celery, sweat and passion fruit. There's not a ton to say about this pedestrian but well-made Sauvignon. It is citrusy with a touch of bell pepper, and it finishes in a comfortable way.

81539,Nederburg 2008 Lyric White (Western Cape),"A minerally, grassy nose leads on this white blend of 51% Sauvignon Blanc, 25% Chenin and 23% Chardonnay. Intense flavors of honey, almond and spice blend well with a citric, zingy edge. Some tropical fruit curviness rounds the whole thing out. A unique and stylish sip.",10.0,86,6,0.9960939822705477
81571,Andeluna 2008 Pasionado Cabernet Franc (Tupungato),"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.",60.0,88,6,0.9960939822705477
81605,Recanati 2008 Yasmin Kosher White White (Shomron),"A deliciously fresh and lively Kosher white blend of 70% Sauvignon Blanc, 20% Riesling and 10% Colombard, offering vibrant aromas and flavors of ripe tropical fruit, key lime and a touch of fresh cut grass.
