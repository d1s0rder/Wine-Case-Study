8901,Nyetimber 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 2017–2017.",70.0,95,9,0.9996874899342079
4628,Anton Bauer 2015 Kreuzgang Chardonnay (Wagram),"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.",39.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
6980,Jardin 2012 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. Ample acidity lifts the medium-weight palate and rich melon, apple and toasted brioche flavors, leading into the long, lingering wood-spiced finish.",24.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
6989,Vasse Felix 2013 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Margaret River),"This bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint. Subtle notes of grilled peach and pineapple slices are carried by ample weight and richness on the midpalate, then gain focus and fold in citrus flavors on the long finish.",70.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
8783,Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.",35.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
10294,Cullen 2008 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),"Made in a somewhat restrained, focused style, this wine features hints of smoke combined with peach and pineapple notes to create the impression of grilled fruit aromas and flavors.

10295,Cullen 2009 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),"Cullen's Kevin John remains one of Margaret River's (and Australia's) benchmark Chardonnays. Scents of grilled peaches lead into flavors of pineapple, vanilla and smoke, but more importantly, the palate is balanced just right. It's not too broad, not too lean; not overly sharp, but not soft. The finish is long and harmonious.",75.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
10971,Jardin 1998 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Exuding style and power, this Chardonnay shows complexity with great depth—and breadth—of aromas and flavors.

Near-perfect fruit/acid balance, a supple mouthfeel, and a superlong finish displaying orange and toast notes wrap it up.",17.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
10972,Penfolds 1998 Yattarna Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"This big wine presents a sophisticated bouquet of toasty, leesy, nutty aromas. Fine depth of fruit and plenty of quality oak show here, with butterscotch, pear and apple flavors. Full-bodied and luscious, it shows the tremendous attention paid and importance assigned to this flagship white. The long, spicy finish sports complex lemon, leesy and mineral accents. To be released 5/01.",65.0,92,9,0.9996874899342079
2715,Gruber Röschitz 2015 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness. The palate removes all doubt and shines with luscious, concentrated sweetness, referencing the pleasant bitterness of honeycomb and the spice of maple syrup. Pure lemon freshness illuminates everything. Drink now through 2025.",30.0,91,9,0.9996874899342079
9250,Bouchard Finlayson 2009 Kaaimansgat Chardonnay (Overberg),"Wood-grilled peach aromas mingle with notes of orange blossom and almond skins on the nose.

12310,Kumeu River 2013 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu),"This shows a touch less oak than the Maté's Vineyard, with more emphasis on pineapple and citrus. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly custardy texture, and turns tangy and crisp on the finish. Drink now–2020.",45.0,91,9,0.9996874899342079
194,Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape),"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom.

Drink now.",20.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
206,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",25.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
715,Viña Cobos 2015 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Chardonnay (Perdriel),"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way.

733,Kooyong 2013 Farrago Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula),"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit.

2095,Picardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton),"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.",33.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
3675,Ridgeview Estate 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus. The palate is slender and fizzes with those primary fruit flavors that have overtones of meadow flowers. This is frothy, refreshing and fun on the surface, but there is serious backbone and intent.",46.0,90,9,0.9996874899342079
5094,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2014 Chardonnay (Leithaberg),"An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity.
