46003,D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale),"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.",19.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,10-20
9646,Luis Duarte 2008 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano),"His skills show in this rich, powerful, finely balanced wine. It has layers of black berry fruits, damsons, bitter chocolate and a good core of acidity. Give this impressive wine 3–4 years.",23.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,20-40
76422,Vinha Paz 2008 Reserva Red (Dão),"With its intense black color and perfumed aromas, this is a superb wine. The palate is firm, solid, still tannic, with the fruit just coming into balance. Nineteen months of wood aging has rounded the wine without dominating. Give this seriously ageworthy wine 5–6 years.",35.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,20-40
25570,Poeira 2008 Red (Douro),"Wonderfully balanced and structured, this is a wine that gives a complete series of flavors from chocolate, black stone fruits, layers of wood and finally the essential acidity. Its texture is grainy, dusty, firm and ready to age for several years.",40.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,20-40
49006,Quinta da Romaneira 2008 Tinto Red (Douro),"Since we last reviewed a vintage of Romaneira, with the 2005 wine, the estate has moved closer to realizing its potential. This is an impressive, powerful yet elegant wine. Its dark fruits are sustained by wood and leavened by acidity. It has a great sense of style and considerable aging potential.",40.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,20-40
6037,Emmerich Knoll 2008 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"The Knoll Grüner style is for a hint of steel, doses of minerality and not too much ornateness despite the wonderfully elaborate traditional bottle labels. The intense fruit, spice and peach character is balanced by acidity, a taut, nervy edge. It will certainly age for 5–6 years.",50.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
21353,Yalumba 2008 The Signature Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa),"Always one of Yalumba's top offerings, the 2008 doesn't show any of the vintage's ill effects. Instead, this blend of Cabernet (56%) and Shiraz (44%) offers a rich, open-knit mouthful of chocomint and dark plum, underscored by savory, meaty notes. This is full bodied and supple, yet muscular, with at least a decade of cellaring potential.",54.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
33386,Schloss Gobelsburg 2008 Heiligenstein Riesling (Kamptal),"Lovers of the purest mineral Riesling, very steely, will go crazy for this wine. It is tightly woven around a core of green and white fruits and the crispest, knife-edge sharp acidity. It is for aging, to produce a stunning wine in 4–5 years at a minimum.",54.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
37523,Trapiche 2008 Viña Jorge Miralles Single Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"The best of the 2008 batch of Trapiche single-vineyard Malbecs is this one from Jorge Miralles' vineyard. Dark, smoky and elegant on the nose, with blackberry, cassis and toasty spice flavors. It's juicy, deep and balanced, with a long, sultry, smooth finish. Pure and showing nary a fault. Drink now through 2015.",55.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
32097,Hans Igler 2008 Ab Ericio Red (Burgenland),"Blaufränkisch dominates this blend with Merlot and Zweigelt. This flagship wine from the Igler winery is powered by its perfumed fruit, cherry and red berry flavors, ripe and juicy at the same time. There is no question of the ageability of this concentrated, complex wine.",62.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
75108,Alvaro Castro 2008 Pape Red (Dão),"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil. Pape is a top wine from Alvaro Castro made predominantly from Touriga Nacional. Perfumed, elegant and structured, with plenty of concentration, this is a wine for serious aging.",65.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
63879,LTU 2008 Malbec (Uco Valley),"LTU is superconcentrated, black as night, minerally, rich and wonderfully balanced. The palate is wide but well structured, while flavors of toasty oak, peppercorn and stirring black fruit are delicious. Toasty, chocolaty and macho to the last drop. Drink now–2016.",65.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
4503,Maurodos 2008 San Román  (Toro),"One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018.",70.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
30265,Emmerich Knoll 2008 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is one of the great Rieslings from the Wachau, a wonderful panoply of ripe, tropical fruit, pierced with flint, spice and minerality. It is rich and opulent, while never losing sight of the core tautness of a fine Riesling.",70.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
66202,Lapostolle 2008 Clos Apalta Red (Colchagua Valley),"Clos Apalta, depending on your point of view, is arguably Chile's best wine. And this vintage is outstanding! Earth, minty spice, ripe berry, minerality and smoky aromas cover the bases. It's superbly structured, with a fine texture and depth. Tastes lush and complex, with blackberry, crème de cassis, fine herbs and tobacco. Finishes classy. Drink now through 2016.",90.0,95,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
22594,John Duval Wines 2008 Eligo Shiraz (Barossa),"Duval used to make Grange, so it is no surprise that his current luxury Shiraz is so successful. The 2008 Eligo oozes with oaky sweetness—vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar notes—but balances that with potent cassis fruit and somehow ends on dry, savory notes of tobacco and spice. Drink now-2018, although it could surprise and go longer.",100.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
78486,Giaconda 2008 Warner Vineyard Shiraz (Victoria),"With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now–2025.",100.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
76424,Numanthia 2008 Termanthia  (Toro),"Lush and classy, with earthy blackberry, hard spice, chocolate and lemon peel aromas. The palate is a mile deep and tannic, but it's not too hard or mean, and it tastes fantastic, with ripe blackberry, chocolate, spice and toast flavors. Complex and masculine, with tobacco and woodspice on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016.",200.0,94,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
37685,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,450.0,100,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
68921,Penfolds 2008 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.",850.0,98,6,0.9960939822705477,above 40
