40688,Cobb 2012 Diane Cobb Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Named for winemaker Ross Cobb's late mother, who more than 20 years ago planted the Coastlands Vineyards' dry-farmed vines—some of the oldest in the region—this exquisitely distinctive wine celebrates all that is extreme and remarkable about the marriage of site, style and variety.

42803,Wayfarer 2012 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"From an estate block planted to a mysterious suitcase clone, this is an insanely memorable and indelible Pinot.

28061,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Du Docteur Rodgers Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish.",102.0,96,7,0.9706802810105034
29858,The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes.

42807,Wayfarer 2012 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Crafted from estate-grown fruit—a marriage of Pommard and Swan clones—Golden Mean comes from three distinct vineyard blocks, the Pommard fermented whole-cluster. It opens with dark, ripe layers of lush cherry-vanilla, the wine concentrated and rich in oak yet balanced in acidity. On the finish is a mix of leather, licorice and wild herb.

There is an impressive, almost muddy thickness to the palate, without being sweet or rich at all, showing flavors thyme, dill, mint and lavender against a core of dark red fruit.",82.0,95,7,0.9706802810105034
