42379,Williams Selyem 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",75.0,99,5,0.9653791952239914
74643,Von Strasser 2008 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),"As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.",125.0,98,5,0.9608616948637672
36014,Williams Selyem 2010 30th Anniversary Cuvée Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley.",125.0,97,5,0.9709637975398236
73350,Black Coyote 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Tasted blind in a large group of Napa Valley Cabernets, this one stood out for sheer power and authority. It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020.",85.0,97,5,0.9709610403156393
114378,Merry Edwards 2007 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014.",54.0,97,5,0.962484214891321
81484,Failla 2010 Occidental Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an astonishingly good Pinot Noir that immediately shows the Sonoma Coast virtues of dryness, acidity, firm minerality, complexity and age worthiness. Flavors abound, with dominating notes of sour cherry, persimmon, cinnamon spice and sweet oak. It's rich and refined, pure, and a great expression of the cool 2010 vintage. Drink now–2020.",60.0,97,5,0.9624815826269955
74117,Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",70.0,97,5,0.9608644931964497
25564,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",52.0,97,5,0.9530132120979032
115016,Semper 2007 Gold Ridge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An extraordinary wine. It's the essence of Russian River Pinot, squared, a big, concentrated, dramatic wine that never loses sight of elegance. Offers a tapestry of cherry pie with the crust, red currant, cherry liqueur and smoky sandalwood flavors that finish with intricate Indian spices. Drink now–2013.",85.0,97,5,0.9437364007504352
52217,Paul Hobbs 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is a pinnacle of the modern style of winemaking in Napa Valley. The tannins are strong but not aggressive. The acidity is just enough to provide balance for the tremendously rich blackberry, black currant, Kahlua and olive flavors. The oak is powerful, but the wine wears it easily. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. And although the alcohol is high, it's not impossible. You can drink it now, although the tannins could benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar.",275.0,96,5,0.9689583935555561
67957,Foxen 2010 Sea Smoke Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious.",85.0,96,5,0.9653784685163407
37391,Reynolds Family Winery 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade.",89.0,96,5,0.965378223819818
25566,Lynmar 2009 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",70.0,96,5,0.9653770922516343
1433,Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",78.0,96,5,0.9608661018828376
32322,Paul Hobbs 2011 Katherine Lindsay Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This bottling by Hobbs typically is a compelling Pinot Noir, but with the 2011 vintage, they've exceeded even the outstanding 2010. The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years.",85.0,96,5,0.9590803621360181
74748,Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",45.0,96,5,0.959079919928955
30855,Baldacci 2006 Brenda's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Easily earns its high score for the sheer power and mass, equal to anything out of Napa. Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive. Not for the faint-hearted, and not a wine to drink now, as it will swamp food. Should begin to emerge after 2012.",85.0,96,5,0.9590775129073618
25567,Merry Edwards 2008 Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",54.0,96,5,0.9571335827464197
104924,Merry Edwards 2011 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years.",60.0,96,5,0.9526219466042518
97833,Celani Family Vineyards 2008 Ardore Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak. Powerful, but not overbearing, this shows an internal coherence that lifts it to a high level of elegant complexity. As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar.",195.0,96,5,0.9525862013739815
