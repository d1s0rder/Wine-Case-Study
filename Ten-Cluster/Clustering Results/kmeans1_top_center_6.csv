12,Mirassou 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple.

105,Pull 2013 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame. Very sharp acidity kicks off the sip, where Pink Lady apples and warm vanilla surround a tight minerality. It's both sharp and slightly sweet.",18.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
111,Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine.

435,Lava Cap 2010 Battonage Chardonnay (El Dorado),"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through.

483,Lutum 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.",50.0,93,6,0.9993948651295279
487,Artesa 2014 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder.

526,Vintage Cowboy 2016 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo.

551,B Cellars 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring.

573,Foxen 2014 Tinaquaic Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic.

732,Iron Hub 2014 Small Lot Chardonnay (Sierra Foothills),"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel.

845,Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",40.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
853,Francis Coppola 2014 Director's Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe.

933,Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County.

996,Landmark 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot.

1032,Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region),"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay.

1079,Aubichon Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter.

1089,Coelho 2014 Apreciação Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula.",35.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279

1134,Washington Hills 2006 Chardonnay (Washington),"The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris.

1187,Summers 2013 Stuhlmuller Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Floral, this medium-bodied white is creamy and touched by richer notions of pear, pineapple and vanilla, reflective of its warmer appellation in a warm year.

1440,Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",75.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279

1460,Browne Family Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit.

1582,Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label.

Crisp and minerally, marked by stone fruit as well as citrus, it finishes rich in caramel and vanilla.",38.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4462,Bump 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",26.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
4475,Tolosa 2011 Pure Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",34.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
4520,Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard La Masía Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar.",35.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279
4535,Franciscan 2012 Cuvée Sauvage Chardonnay (Carneros),"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed. Flowery aromas of honeysuckle open the way for lemon curd and ripe apple to compete with a depth of crème brûlée character that provides plenty of complexity, with additional accents of honey and spice.",40.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
4544,Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",18.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
4551,Savage Grace 2013 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region.",26.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
4571,Decoy 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This crisp, clean Chardonnay is a good find for $20. Fruity with a suggestive note of caramel on the nose, it delivers a taste of citrus and green apple on the palate that evolves into a satisfying finish that's entirely tropical.",20.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4588,Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.",24.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
4613,Wolff 2014 Old Vines Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous.",24.0,92,6,0.9993948651295279
4632,Esser Cellars 2001 Chardonnay (California),"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak. The wonderfully creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish. Despite the statewide appellation, this is as good as many regional Chardonnays.",8.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
4640,Brophy Clark 2008 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Very bright and acidic, with the savory taste of a sour lemondrop candy. If you're sensitive to acidity you'll find it tart. But it's deliciously layered, with tiers of buttered toast, vanilla and spice.",20.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4641,Carmel Road 2008 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast.",18.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4653,Villa Andretti 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",28.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4678,MacRostie 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"So bright and zingy in acidity, and so ripe in tangerine, mango, lime fruit and honeysuckle, that you hardly notice the oak influence. Yet, it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big, powerful Chardonnay, clean and vibrant, for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.",25.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
4707,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Elton Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"Sweet and extra ripe, this pushes the peach and apricot fruit to a rich and focused center, and keeps the impact of new French oak at just 20%. Which is plenty, adding just enough sweet and toasty vanilla to the extended, rich finish.",45.0,92,6,0.9993948651295279
4714,Eric Kent 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet.",42.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279

4797,Liquid Farm 2010 White Hill Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Marked by brisk, cutting acidity, this Chardonnay is bone dry, with a steely, stony cut of mineral that's relieved by lemon and lime flavors. It's a severe wine by itself, but it should be food friendly.",38.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4798,Lucia 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity.",40.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4800,Aquinas 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.",15.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
4832,Ashan 2013 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"All aged in single-use French oak, this offers pleasing nuances of corn on the cob, spice, mineral and chamomile. The prickly pear flavors are both elegantly styled and well balanced.",45.0,89,6,0.9993948651295279
4835,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Green melon, lime and lemon flavors ring fresh and pure in this unoaked Chardonnay. It's anchored by a bracing backbone of acidity, but the palate builds in richness and mouthfeel, finishing on a riper, slightly tropical fruit note.",16.0,89,6,0.9993948651295279
4855,Bello Family Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Carneros),"The oak is so strong that this wine is dominated by buttered toast, butterscotch, caramel and vanilla flavors. The malolactic fermentation adds to the impression of softness and gives the wine a creamy finish.",45.0,85,6,0.9993948651295279
4862,San Simeon 2012 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness.",22.0,85,6,0.9993948651295279
4926,Silver Buckle 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),"A full-bodied yet crisp Chardonnay, balanced with just a tiny hint of lingering ripeness. Fine for mid-week meals.",18.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
4933,Broadway Vineyards 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros),"Tasty in the modern style, with ripe, forward pineapple, orange, peach jam and buttered toast flavors. There's good acidity, and even a hint of minerals, but the wine ultimately is lushly one-dimensional.",30.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
4935,Captûre 2011 Ma Vie Carol Chardonnay (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),"This ambitious winery continues to struggle to find the formula for pricy Chardonnay. They turn now to this new Sonoma County appellation, but the result is still pretty ordinary. The wine is all about buttered toast, popcorn and fruit jam, with a creamy texture that's universally appealing.",48.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
4948,Fess Parker 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",35.0,93,6,0.9993948651295279
4989,Mer Soleil 2010 Silver Unoaked Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Mer Soleil's Chardonnay grapes dependably get so ripe, they offer explosive flavors even without oak. You won't miss a thing without that barrel. The pineapple, orange and golden mango flavors are delicious on their own, and even offer a hint of vanilla. A mouthwateringly fresh squeeze of acidity makes everything bright and clean.",24.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5049,Educated Guess 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"With a touch of oak, this friendly Chardonnay is a very nice wine for everyday drinking. It's dry and brisk, with pleasant apricot, tangerine and mineral flavors.",17.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5092,Foley 2014 Steel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"The winery's annual stainless-steel bottling, this is showy rather than reserved, with ripe Asian pear, tropical flowers, sweet apple blossoms, pineapple and a bit of vanilla on the nose. Nicely fresh, it's bright on the palate, with a sizzle of acidity and grippy chalkiness that frame the poached-pear palate.",30.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5107,Milbrandt 2009 Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",23.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5121,DaMa 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.",21.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
5124,Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros),"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.",30.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
5163,Paraiso Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes. The texture is quite pithy once sipper, showing grapefruit and apple skins, and then it warms toward yellow pears and a sea salt wamrth.",45.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5166,Replica 2014 Chardonnay (California),"Vibrant, delicious and tastefully oaky, this wine smells like spearmint, tart apples and buttered toast, with flavors of citrus and crisp white peach. There is some heft in the texture, but it's medium bodied, very supple, and energized by fresh acidity and oak spiciness.",12.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5169,Trefethen 2013 Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"There's a gorgeous floral and citrus bouquet upon entry, followed by lithe flavors of orange blossom and zest. From an estate-grown vineyard, the wine is balanced and elegant, with a twist of pineapple custard on the finish.",35.0,92,6,0.9993948651295279
5284,Kirkland Signature 2014 Signature Series Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Ripe and tropical in pineapple, papaya and guava, this is a medium-bodied style of the variety, lightly oaked, which shows tart lemon on the finish and a lingering accent of anise. It is a screaming deal for the price.",13.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5299,Hunt Cellars 2014 Moonlight Sonata Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Clean if slightly sweet notes of apple, Meyer lemon pith, honeydew melon, peach blossom and bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. It's quite light on the palate, with touches of light pear and apple, with that bubblegum touch arising as well.",37.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5310,Airlie 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay cloaks its thin fruit in aggressive flavors of wood and butter. The wine itself is soft and watery, quickly disappearing into a frail finish.",14.0,82,6,0.9993948651295279
5338,Barnard Griffin 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of tangerine and melon are light but display nuance. It tingles the palate with a broad, textured feel and a finish that sails.",11.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5360,Taj 2009 Cold Creek Ranch Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"Strong and awkward in winemaker interventions, this Chardonnay is dominated by buttered toast and popcorn flavors. Pineapple jam shows up, accented with crisp acidity.",24.0,84,6,0.9993948651295279
5366,flipflop 2009 Chardonnay (California),"Not bad for a seven buck Chardonnay in a screwtop. Shows plenty of varietal flavor in the buttercream, honey and pineapple flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced.",7.0,84,6,0.9993948651295279
5385,Bogle 2014 Chardonnay (California),"This easily affordable wine is a full-blown oaky version that has prominent toasted oak and wood smoke aromas that meld with butter, caramel and ripe pear flavors. It feels almost sweet and is full-bodied with mild acidity.",10.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
5402,Mira 2016 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Made from Robert Young-cloned grapes, this wine is perfumed in exotic lychee and briny, salty oak. Fulsome flavors of apple skin are generously expansive on the full-bodied palate.",33.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5407,Point & Line 2015 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach.",40.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5412,Spicy Vines 2015 Foggy Mountain Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge),"This is a rich and well-balanced wine in which tempting vanilla and other baking spices are backed by crisp and ripe apple and pear flavors, and followed by a lingering, marzipan finish.",38.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5418,Truchard 2015 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Moderate in oak and well-structured, this estate-grown wine is subdued and classy, with defined layers of green olive, juicy apple and lemongrass, a tiny hint of jalapeño adding a touch of spice. Food-friendly, it'll complement a versatile range of dishes.",30.0,90,6,0.9993948651295279
5522,Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Oak Puncheon Fermented Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",60.0,92,6,0.9993948651295279
5543,Cinnabar 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Succulent and opulent, with ripe pineapple purée, Meyer lemon tart, kiwi fruit, pastry crust and tangy mineral flavors, enriched with the buttered toast and caramel of new oak.",29.0,89,6,0.9993948651295279
5544,Boedecker Cellars 2007 Purity Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"The name refers to the fact that the wine was both fermented and aged in stainless steel barrels. Made with Dijon clones from two different vineyards, it's fruit-driven, nicely flavored, offering melon, apple and white peach in equal proportion. It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass.",18.0,89,6,0.9993948651295279
5552,Wölffer 2015 Chardonnay (Long Island),"Curious whiffs of raspberry and pink grapefruit lend a particularly fruity, forward tone to this medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's easy drinking and plush in mouthfeel but brightened by sunny grapefruit and tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2019.",19.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
5553,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2016 Lightly Oaked Chardonnay (California),Touches of ginger and orange zest lighten up the ample fruit flavors of this well-balanced value-priced wine. It has good acidity to match the ripeness of the Anjou pear and white peach flavors.,8.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
5560,Martin Ranch 2015 J.D. Hurley Griva Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Lemon-candy aromas are rounded with white peach, marshmallow and honeysuckle on the slightly sweet-leaning nose of this bottling. The sip is straightforward with lemon peel, slight marzipan, Gala apple and Bosc pear flavors.",25.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
5562,Midnight 2016 Chardonnay,"There's a strong peachy scent to the nose of this bottling, but it's bolstered by sea salt and a scratched lime-skin freshness. The lime flavor is prominent on the sip, from pith to juice, and there is decent tension along with honeydew flavors.",29.0,87,6,0.9993948651295279
5583,McFadden 2014 Blue Quail Chardonnay (Potter Valley),"This has attractive peach and floral aromas and flavors, medium to full body, and a soft texture that is bolstered slightly by appley acidity.",15.0,85,6,0.9993948651295279
5593,Custard 2013 Comfort Wine Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Fuzzy stone fruit from apricot to peach dominate on the nose and palate in this straightforward, creamy and richer-styled wine. Batches of apple and lemon give it a crisp edge toward the middle before denser crème brûlée and vanilla take over on the finish.",22.0,85,6,0.9993948651295279
5631,Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",55.0,95,6,0.9993948651295279
5643,Lynmar 2011 La Serenité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",70.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279
5647,Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",55.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279
5650,Gary Farrell 2010 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",45.0,94,6,0.9993948651295279
5681,Ashan 2016 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of candy corn, spice and almond butter are followed by full-bodied, tropical-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of richness and intensity. It's a delicious example of the variety, with a lingering finish.",25.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
5687,Clay Pigeon 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted.",25.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
5719,Beauregard 2013 Beaureagard Ranch Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter.",50.0,93,6,0.9993948651295279
5732,Kuleto Estate 2014 Homestead Block Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is from a hillside estate vineyard and is entirely barrel fermented, its oak subtle and supportive. Medium bodied and not overripe, it offers honeysuckle aromas and lime and lemon rind flavors.",45.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
5790,Sleight of Hand 2010 The Enchantress Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.",28.0,91,6,0.9993948651295279
5881,Bowers Harbor 2013 Unwooded Chardonnay (Old Mission Peninsula),"Green apple with a squeeze of fresh lemon makes for a basic and easy unoaked Chardonnay. While standard and simple, this is a perfectly enjoyable wine to pair with lighter fare.",15.0,85,6,0.9993948651295279
5909,Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 59 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices.",13.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
5922,Sbragia 2006 Home Ranch Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",26.0,86,6,0.9993948651295279
5946,Husch 2011 Vine One Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"A light, lemony and crisp Chardonnay with a long, lemony finish begging for fresh seafood and spice—think fish tacos—Husch's Vine One has a hint of just-ripe pear layered in, too. Refreshing and aromatic, this is an all-around great value that'll pair well with a wide range of foods.",18.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279
5952,Firestone 2011 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"This rich, ripe wine hits all your Chardonnay sweet spots. It's honeyed in tropical fruits, with oaky notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The best thing is the clean, zesty acidity.",28.0,88,6,0.9993948651295279

5962,Hopper Creek 2006 Los Chamizal Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse.

6038,Abeja 2009 Chardonnay (Washington),"Fresh and firm, with juicy primary fruits that meld together flavors of tropical and stone fruits—a riot of papaya, peach, pineapple, candied lemon and more. The butterscotch barrel notes glide into the mid-palate and coat the back of the throat, resonating long after the wine is swallowed.

6078,Phelps Creek 2007 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Rich Cushman made this wine; it nicely expresses the minerality and tight fruit that characterizes this excellent vineyard.

6136,Keller Estate 2010 Oro de Plata Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Awesomely rich and ripe in Meyer lemon tart, orange zest and golden mango flavors, with oak and lees nuances that make it complex and interesting.

6176,Michael David 2014 Chardonnay (Lodi),"The winemaker aged a majority of this wine on the lees in new French oak, and the rest in stainless steel.

6194,Brewer-Clifton 2012 Machado Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This esteemed winery's younger Chardonnays are all about tension and the future. This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass.

6457,Robert Renzoni 2015 Barile Chardonnay (Temecula Valley),"Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California.
