5888,La Chablisienne 2006 Les Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.",67.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
1308,Alex Gambal 2014 La Maltroie Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021.",80.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5776,Larmandier-Bernier 2006 Vieilles Vignes de Cramant Grand Cru Chardonnay (Champagne),"This wine is sourced from two parcels, one planted in the 1930s and the other in the 1950s. The low dosage is possible because of the concentration and ripeness of the fruit, resulting in a sophisticated, balanced and rich wine with a lemon zest flavor, a tight, mineral texture, and a crisp finish.",90.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5891,Xavier Monnot 2006 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),"Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",99.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
319,Philippe Colin 2014 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020.",110.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5895,Domaine Laroche 2006 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",117.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
2787,Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.",145.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5890,Olivier Leflaive 2006  Corton-Charlemagne,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",150.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
8912,Lanson 2002 Noble Cuvée Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Côte des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further.",150.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
10030,Domaine Chanson 2011 Héritiers Paul Chanson  (Corton Vergennes),"From vines owned by the Chanson family, this is a wonderfully rich wine, deliciously fruity at the same time. Apple and citrus as well as richer apricots come through powerfully. It's structured with a sense of opulence, richness that also has a tight texture. It needs to age; drink from 2019.",187.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
2034,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Combettes Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.",225.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
2035,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste.",260.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5892,Domaine Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",273.0,94,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
17521,Salon 1996 Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast. It is rich, but so austere and structured. Like many Salon Champagnes, this will age for 20 years or more.",350.0,97,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
323,Louis Latour 2014  Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet,"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.",380.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5321,Domaine Leflaive 2008  Bâtard-Montrachet,"This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least.",430.0,97,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
19381,Louis Latour 2009  Montrachet,"The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist.",440.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
10034,Louis Latour 2011  Montrachet,"This is the big one, one of the most treasured white wine vineyards in the world. And the wine is magnificent, balanced with restrained power and style. Yellow fruits are shot through with acidity that conveys a nervy texture and an intense, concentrated character. This needs many years; don't drink before 2020.",520.0,95,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
5322,Domaine Leflaive 2008  Chevalier-Montrachet,"A ripe, toasty wine, very buttery. It has rich, almost sweet yellow fruit balanced with a wonderful mineral texture. The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish.",550.0,97,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
313,Louis Latour 2014 Le Montrachet  (Montrachet),"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",630.0,96,0,0.9554742531623801,above 40
