7692,Cono Sur 2013 20 Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Dense, baked and mulled blackberry and cassis aromas include bold but classy oak notes. This feels seamless except for raring tough tannins, while flavors of toast, graphite and spiced blackberry finish smooth and chewy, with a sense of lushness despite lasting residual tannins. Drink through 2025.",35.0,93,8,0.9994698635153196
7908,Marques de Griñon 2013 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Highly concentrated black-fruit aromas of plum and currant are made more interesting by cola and forest-floor notes. This is a dense, chewy and almost fat Cabernet Sauvignon. Baked berry, fig and savory grilled-meat flavors are massive, backed up by a lush, deep finish. Drink 2018–2025.",40.0,93,8,0.9994698635153196
8591,Ventisquero 2013 Enclave Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Enclave is Ventisquero Winemaker Felipe Tosso's collaboration with John Duval from Australia.

10969,Penfolds 1998 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.",90.0,93,8,0.9994698635153196

Has tannins to resolve, best held for a year or two.",15.0,93,8,0.9994698635153196
1378,Concha y Toro 2009 Terrunyo Vineyard Selection Block Las Terrazas Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes.

Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018.",38.0,92,8,0.9994698635153196
3190,Vasse Felix 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"Vasse Felix's impressively consistent track record with Cabernet continues with the 2009, a mouth-filling, supple wine that still retains a modicum of structure. Bold cassis fruit is balanced by earthy, meaty complexity and finishes long and mouthwatering. Drinkable now, but it should hold easily through 2020, and possibly longer.",38.0,92,8,0.9994698635153196

3483,Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",60.0,92,8,0.9994698635153196
4618,Concha y Toro 2013 Don Melchor Puente Alto Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"Initially this smells foxy, with jumpy untamed berry and plum notes racing across the nose. After the aromas come around, this is hard and choppy on the palate, while herbal black-plum and carob flavors finish more lushly than before, but still fairly tannic. Drink through 2023.",120.0,92,8,0.9994698635153196
4627,Koyle 2013 Royale Los Lingues Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028.",26.0,92,8,0.9994698635153196

8348,Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Powerful blackberry, prune, juniper, cola and fern aromas are demanding but appealing for Spanish Cabernet.

115,Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",45.0,91,8,0.9994698635153196
