37879,Williams Selyem 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Rich, balanced and full bodied, this shows exuberantly ripe, sweet flavors of blackberries, mulberries, dark chocolate and raisins, with notes of exotic spices.

109366,Blackbird Vineyards 2010 Contrarian Red (Napa Valley),"So soft and dense in richness, this is easy to enjoy now. But you really want to restrain that impulse and give it some time in the cellar. Blended from roughly equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's dry and tannic, but with a molten core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise and sweet new oak. Very fine, very elaborate and complex. Give it 5–6 years, at least. This wine could still be unfolding in 2020.",125.0,94,3,0.27822434040406857
25032,Moone-Tsai 2010 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This powerful Cabernet is bold in alcohol and ultra-ripe with fruit. The Port-like heat is balanced by luxurious cherry and black currant flavors, and lush new French oak that imparts a soft toastiness. It's hard to see the wine aging beyond 6–7 years, so decant it and enjoy soon.",185.0,90,3,0.27822233255965423
108212,Shafer 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.",50.0,91,3,0.27819564650016215

58016,Groth 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"There's a lot of rich, ripe blackberry, blueberry, black currant and cassis flavor in this Cabernet, but it's still finding its balance. The fruit is primary in nature with strong tannins and oak that's not yet integrated. The wine lacks subtlety now, but on the other hand, it doesn't seem to have a long life ahead, so give it 3–4 years and drink with steak.",61.0,88,3,0.2781074455012041

105713,Prospect 772 2013 Black Tie Charlie Red (California),"This wine is powerful enough to serve with wild boar carpaccio, if there is such a thing, or with blue cheese like a Port. The color is unusually dark and opaque, a stark black with a faintly purple rim. It smells spicy and tastes very concentrated, like blackberry jam, wood smoke and black pepper. The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.",27.0,89,3,0.27806486056038726
115580,Meeker 2012 Four Kings Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

57721,Waterbrook 2005 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",22.0,87,3,0.2780250043625174
60076,Stottle 2013 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This wine's aromas are quite generous, suggesting herbs, vanilla, baking spice and purple fruit. Its cranberry and cherry flavors are both tart and ripe, supported by soft tannins and a lingering café au lait note. The oak influence gets in the way of the fruit at times, but it's pleasant all the same.",28.0,88,3,0.27800801948699777
78419,Obsidian 2012 Molten Red (Oregon),"Equally amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot go into this high-octane blend. There are suggestions of black olive and dried leaf, but the fruit seems canned and the tannins have a tinny aftertaste.",38.0,85,3,0.27799884014462056
87126,Man O' War 2009 Ironclad Red (Waiheke Island),"This powerful, intense Bordeaux-style blend includes (in decreasing amounts) Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is richly textured, and it offers ripe boysenberry and cassis fruit, layered with supple tannins and smoky oak.

62884,Kanonkop 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A powerful, brooding nose of tobacco, smoke and red cherry starts this elegant Cabernet from Kanonkop. On the palate, more warming spices and tobacco, with smooth, ripe tannins that are fine and velvety. Some oak offers spice, but the wine is extremely balanced and food friendly. The lingering finish delivers a spin of red berry and smoke. Excellent now but could age a few years to further develop.",33.0,90,3,0.2779594438418966
60820,Babcock 1998 Fathom Red (Santa Barbara County),"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast.",30.0,89,3,0.2779567187016797
47707,Ravines 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Though this wine offers the vibrant cherry fruit and pepper of a good New York Cab Franc, it's a bit one-dimensional. On the nose, candied cherry and spice lead, followed by a slightly tart wave of cherry. Oak adds just a bit of interest. Pair with duck or fowl to soften it.",18.0,82,3,0.27795418215719925

61360,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Here's a very rich, elaborate wine that defines the modern, ripe style of Zinfandel. You certainly can't complain about the fruit, which is massive in red and black berry and stone fruit flavors, sprinkled with black pepper, cinnamon and star anise.

While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background.

65734,Vall Llach 2012 Idus Red (Priorat),"Ripe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.",50.0,94,3,0.26986749302506546
22150,Fall Line 2013 Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil.

115209,Coho 2006 Michael Black Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality.

96623,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Capoeira Tinto Red (Tejo),"A blend of Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft and smooth wine.

44631,Fall Line 2005 Horse Heaven Hills Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Herb, spice, smoke and a whiff of roasted meat lead into a wine that is balanced and deep. This puts a focus on the dark side: black fruits, tar, coffee and smoke. It's grainy and tannic, and the tannins and toast may eventually outrun the fruit.

2793,Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley),"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",125.0,94,3,0.2695551617116389
19575,Mitolo 2006 Savitar Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010–2020.",66.0,90,3,0.2695413927720018

The palate on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère-Petit Verdot-Syrah blend is tightly wound, with grating tannins. The berry flavors are a touch leafy, while the finish brings red fruit flavors and a touch of carob. Drink through 2018.",49.0,90,3,0.26366620772302585
49879,Legacy 2006 Red (Alexander Valley),"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",75.0,96,3,0.2636489436388358

18704,Luce della Vite 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,Luce della Vite opens with an inky dark appearance and added extraction that is hard to find otherwise in 2008 Brunello. Soft aromas of cherry and blackberry are followed by supple fragrances of leather and spice. There is fruit pulp in the mouth and the wine's extra richness really helps to balance out its acidity and those still-young tannins.,93.0,92,3,0.2636092331791622

5724,John Duval Wines 2012 Entity Shiraz (Barossa),"This is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper.

There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit.

Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy.

74217,Staglin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",450.0,100,3,0.26307297900242377

87762,Brys 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula),"While the nose seems dominated by oak, with charred bacon and cola aromas, the palate shows plenty of fruit, offering velvety dark cherry in the lead. Savory spice notes streak across the plush, structured palate, giving way to a mocha finish. There's enough acidity and tannic structure to explore how this will develop in the years to come.

It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir.

60805,Schug 1999 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),"The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth.

Velvety and supple, this is a modulated mix of bright, sassy blackberry and currant fruit, spiced up with the peppery highlights of Syrah. The effect is to move it solidly into the Australian camp, which makes perfect sense, for nowhere else in the New World do these two grapes sync up so well.
