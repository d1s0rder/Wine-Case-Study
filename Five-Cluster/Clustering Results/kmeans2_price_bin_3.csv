101692,Iron Horse 2002 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),"The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",38.0,95,3,0.9705251822000759,20-40
40895,Buty 2006 Columbia Rediviva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah. Amazing aromatic complexity grabs you and leads you into the dark interior of the wine, a riot of red and black fruits, moist earth, smoke, anise, herb and toast. Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more.",48.0,96,3,0.9523485422044722,above 40
38982,Roederer Estate 2005 L'Ermitage Brut Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"This impressive bubbly has apple, caramel and toffee aromas, melt-in-the-mouth Bosc pear and spice rack flavors, a rich but firm texture, and long finish. It possesses amazing liveliness, body and depth, and seems to reveal more nuances and freshness with each sip. While terrific to drink now, it can be cellared through at least 2020.",48.0,96,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
17523,Chalk Hill 2005 Botrytised Sémillon (Chalk Hill),"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",55.0,95,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
13988,Rodney Strong 2004 Symmetry Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",55.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
32584,Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after.",75.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
17525,Duckhorn 2004 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now–2010.",85.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
43713,Betz Family 2005 Le Parrain Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish.",85.0,96,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
37384,Dolce 2006 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.",85.0,98,3,0.9523485422044722,above 40
68028,Kendall-Jackson 2003 Stature Red (Napa Valley),"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.",95.0,95,3,0.9738642274378875,above 40
74653,Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"Don't even think about opening this brut for at least six years and probably far longer. Made from 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Noir, it's rich and full-bodied, with elaborately ripe flavors of tangerines, raspberries, roasted almonds and coconut, brioche, honey and vanilla. Good as it is, it simply needs time for everything to transmute into magic.",100.0,96,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
12819,Kendall-Jackson 2004 Stature Red (Napa Valley),"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least.",110.0,96,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
6356,Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",110.0,97,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
44394,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.",125.0,97,3,0.9523485422044722,above 40
60019,Quintessa 2004 Red (Rutherford),"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward.",125.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
82808,Leonetti Cellar 2005 Reserve Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish.",125.0,97,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
83931,Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"An awesome rosé, just a tremendous feat. Made from 11 vineyards in 4 counties, it shows a masterful art of the blend. Insanely rich in toasted bread and lees, showing the influence of six years in the bottle. A tremendous core of strawberries, raspberries, orange zest, roasted macadamia, roasted coconut, pear liqueur and honey lasts into the finish. Despite the richness, the wine is dry. So lovely now you can hardly keep your hands off, but it should age gracefully for the next 10–15 years.",130.0,98,3,0.9733266930026989,above 40
12820,Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine.",145.0,96,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
45461,Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.",150.0,97,3,0.966990360015615,above 40
24001,Iron Horse 2003 Joy! Estate Bottled Sparkling (Green Valley),"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",250.0,98,3,0.9738642274378875,above 40
