32622,Kracher 2013 Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 5 Zwischen den Seen Scheurebe (Burgenland),"Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph.",95.0,97,4,0.9661248930525558
114198,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2008 Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen Trockenbeerenauslese - 375 ml Riesling (Pfalz),"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar.

The balance is exquisite, and the way the acids dance along the palate make the wine clean and lively.",50.0,97,4,0.962802099521644
41066,Royal Tokaji 2013 6 Puttonyos Aszú Gold Label  (Tokaji),"This ethereal Tokaji Aszú is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot.

The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying.",80.0,97,4,0.9591081279288286
112788,Rochioli 2010 South River Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal. The complexity of flavor stuns, offering tiers of pineapples, oranges, green apples and golden mangoes. Then the oaky influences appear in the form of buttered toast and caramel, with a suggestion of honey. The finish is dry and crisp in acidity.",60.0,97,4,0.9572517429009124
80401,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037.",38.0,96,4,0.9737108037137842
78044,Domaine Weinbach 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Cuvée Saint Catherine Riesling (Alsace),"Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance.",62.0,96,4,0.9725904843291402
30856,Williams Selyem 2007 Late Harvest Muscat (Russian River Valley),"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.",40.0,96,4,0.9717323354924539
37389,Macauley 2007 Special Selected Late Harvest Botrytis Sémillon (Alexander Valley),"This is one of the best dessert wines available from California. It's dazzlingly rich and sweet in orange jam, apricot, honey, buttered cinnamon toast and créme brûlée flavors. The intense sweetness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, and the wine despite its sweetness accomplishes the miracle of finishing dry and clean. The grapes are 100% Sémillon.",45.0,96,4,0.9686213322270605
42387,Williams Selyem 2010 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",65.0,96,4,0.9684869492703765
8891,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",78.0,96,4,0.9659102119407827
107177,Kracher 2013 Nouvelle Vague Grande Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese No. 6 White (Burgenland),"Candied lemon, beeswax and honey are wrapped in the sumptuous embrace of vanilla. Topnotes of passion fruit and nettle appear too, while the palate is conquered by the all-encompassing concentration of this TBA. The precise flavors have a bright, etched citrus frame that shapes and balances the sweetness. Apricot, bergamot, apple and passion fruit all make an appearance. Aromatically, the length goes on and on. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2040, at least.",120.0,96,4,0.9656033058145647
42388,Williams Selyem 2010 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The acidity really makes this Chardonnay come alive, providing vitality, a quality that's boosted by an undercurrent of minerals.

30258,Livio Felluga 2006 Picolit Picolit (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Beauty and purity emerge from the nose of this highly complex and delicate dessert wine. Aromas include pressed flowers, honey, white peach and a touch of mustiness that adds depth and dimension at the back. It's a smooth, succulent drink that delivers sweetness, but never too much of it. Gorgeous.",90.0,96,4,0.9645508011654605
71397,Kracher 2012 Nouvelle Vague Nr. 6 Grande Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese White (Burgenland),"The perfume of fully ripe, lusciously juicy peach is nearly overwhelming. It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts. Nectar indeed.",45.0,96,4,0.9628242277695408
107174,Salomon-Undhof 2009 Bienenfeld Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040.",38.0,96,4,0.9626633250304993
98024,Bründlmayer 2013 Heiligenstein Reserve Lyra Riesling (Kamptal),"Beautifully lifted, almost sublimated apple and citrus fruit combine to make a perfumed, appetizing nose. That pure apple theme continues on the concentrated palate that sings with purity to leave a satisfying and honest impression of completeness. Pure and simply very delicious.",35.0,96,4,0.960762574460354
8910,Jean Biecher & Fils 2016 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027.",45.0,95,4,0.9766601539779991
52227,Paul Hobbs 2010 Edwards James Estate Wente Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There isn't a Chardonnay out there as rich, opulent and delicious as this one. It dazzles with tropical fruit, pear, peach, green apple, honey, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Brisk, lime-driven acidity provides beautiful balance. It's oaky, but the smoky, buttered-toast and butterscotch notes are nearly perfect. Drink now with rich crab, lobster or scallop dishes.",75.0,95,4,0.9737175149960541
57047,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2015 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon (Alto Adige),"Enticing intense aromas including exotic fruit, fragrant white wild flower, cut grass and Alpine herb offer an intriguing introduction to this stunning wine.
