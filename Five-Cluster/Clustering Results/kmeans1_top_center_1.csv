3,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",65.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19,Acrobat 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot.

23,Castello di Amorosa 2011 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.",69.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30,Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.",50.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
36,Hawkins Cellars 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.",22.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
69,Z'IVO 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.",25.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
141,Albatross Ridge 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
156,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",44.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
160,Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.",38.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
168,McIntyre Vineyards 2006 Mission Ranch Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart.

172,Harrington 2006 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit.

208,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",15.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
228,Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",45.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
231,Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.",22.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413

261,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",34.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
263,J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.",52.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
265,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future.

324,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
347,Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry.

402,Rusack 2011 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
404,Chehalem 2011 Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex.

410,Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
423,Babcock 2010 Ocean's Ghost Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir. It has a silky texture and complex flavors of red cherries, persimmons, cola and spices. Acidity is great but there's something slightly off, suggesting a trace of unripeness. Drink now.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

453,D.R. Stephens 2014 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure.

454,Davis Family 2014 Soul Patch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
455,Davis Family 2014 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
460,Rex Hill 2014 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
461,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.",65.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
464,Tumwater 2014 Prince Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit.

469,Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",50.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
470,Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",50.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
475,Paul O'Brien 2014 Bradley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA.

476,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Twin Creeks Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture.",42.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
477,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
478,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs.

485,Iron Horse 2013 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site.

498,Loring Wine Company 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body. It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
500,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling.

520,Silvertip 2014 Unfiltered Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose.

This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

563,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel.

618,Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone.

644,Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side.

686,Lane Tanner 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian.

705,Adelsheim 2010 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.",105.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
718,Beacon Hill 2013 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago.

907,Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
911,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",75.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
945,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",24.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
962,Sea Slopes 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola.

963,Trisaetum 2014 Family Reserve MMXIV Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.",100.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
964,Bergström 2015 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.",95.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
965,Bergström 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone.

987,Dion 2014 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
989,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor.

1018,Belden Barns 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored.

1057,Pali 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",48.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
1058,Robert Stemmler 2005 Nugent Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
1094,Tantara 2015 Dierberg Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality.

1623,Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance.

2678,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam.

2694,Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic.

2776,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions.

3003,Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early.

It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
3116,Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest.

3131,Siduri 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,39.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
3145,Bishop Creek Cellars 2007 Whole Cluster Reserve Pinot Noir,"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center.

3153,Left Coast Cellars 2008 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fragrant start brings raspberries and rose petals, along with traces of Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice.

3173,Eola Hills 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"One of Oregon's best-kept secrets is this well-made budget-priced Pinot from Eola Hills. Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit. That brings an extra dimension to the wine, with some tannic muscle and a streak of dried leaf and forest floor flavors along with ripe strawberry fruit.",19.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
3175,Gersing 2015 Madrona Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit.

3322,Lucky Star 2009 Pinot Noir (California),"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety.",9.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
3330,Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice.

3338,Morgan 2012 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan.

3471,Sojourn 2011 Ridgetop Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second.

3477,Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity.

3481,Archery Summit 2008 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within.

Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so.

It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction.

4061,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024.",115.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413

4066,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",72.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
4069,Byron 2013 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy.

4072,Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way.

4077,Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",50.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
4087,Gary Farrell 2010 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Tastes a little vegetal and simple, with cherry jam, asparagus and sweet oak flavors. Not a success, and a particular disappointment compared to the winery's other 2010 single-vineyard Pinots.",50.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413

4108,Rock Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This single vineyard cuvée is quite light, yet retains your interest with a thin dusting of cocoa and ground coffee around the tangy berry fruit.

4138,Scott Family 2008 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"This is a fresh, lively Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's elegantly silky and dry, with crisp acids and pure flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak. A touch of oak adds smoky richness.",39.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

4200,Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish.

4212,Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power.

With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",20.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413

4219,Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",24.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
4227,Coeur de Terre 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.",22.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
4228,Cummins Road 2012 Pinot Noir,"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

4298,Rodney Strong 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017.",25.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

4427,Saxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich.

4477,Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Rock Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Ripe, forward flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola mark this Pinot Noir.

4491,Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",70.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
4649,Luminous Hills 2008 Estate Grown Pinot Noir,"Light, young vine fruit flavors mix strawberry and rhubarb, with a tangy, citrus component underscoring the midpalate.

4664,Rex Hill 2011 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Still young, hard and sharp-edged, the wine reveals dark flavors of charred toast and espresso, set around a core of tight cranberry and raspberry fruit.

4701,Hyland 2012 Select Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Just one barrel was made of this reserve.

4742,Truchard 2011 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This Pinot Noir is rich and elegant, but somewhat straightforward with flavors of raspberry and cherry wrapped in a pleasant coating of smoky oak. It's less ageable than Truchard's 2010 vintage so decant and drink now.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

4882,Fullerton 2014 Croft Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Coming on stiff and herbal, the Croft needs some time and patience. There are not quite resolved streaks of citrus, cherries, earthy tannins and a touch of cocoa powder. Still a baby, this should improve over the next three to five years.",43.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
4883,Gehricke 2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"An elegant, restrained wine from the earthy appellation cooled by Pacific Ocean winds, this wine conveys a plethora of pretty clove, tea and rose petals, finished in cinnamon stick and vanilla.",39.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
4890,Willful 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Nicely textured strawberry fruit is featured here. It drinks almost like an especially rich rosé, fresh and simple, in a good way. There's a dash of bitter green in the finishing tannins.",26.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
4898,Black Kite 2009 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Defines a certain California style in the intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, whose sweetness is accented by caramelized oak. Delicious, and the acidity and tannins are just fine, but it's a little obvious, and wants greater subtlety.",52.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
4916,Longoria 2011 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There are some lean, green peppercorn, mint and herb flavors that suggest unripeness. The chilly vintage appears to have taken its toll, despite some well-oaked raspberry and cherry lushness. Drink up.",50.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
4920,Merriam 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a good, everyday Pinot that's rich and sweet in berries and cherries, with plenty of oak to give it that buttered toast and vanilla deliciousness. Enjoy it now.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
4922,Peters Family 2009 Sonoma Stage VIneyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is heavy and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, with soft acids and rich cherry, currant, anise and mocha flavors. Doesn't have the structure for aging, so drink up.",45.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
4929,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Whole Cluster Fermented Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit.

4930,Wy'East Vineyards 2010 Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Fermented in one ton French oak fermenters, this estate grown Pinot Noir from 1980s plantings has notes of cherry, char, and butterscotch. The fruit is on the lighter side of medium bodied with the wood just a bit too heavy for the wine that's in the glass.",39.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
5018,Miner 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
5039,Rex Hill 2008 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity. Highlights of fresh-cut herbs dot the finish.",52.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5046,Stephen Ross 2009 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"One of the richer, riper Edna Valley Pinots, offering waves of raspberry and cherry marmalade flavors. It sure is delicious, if a little direct. Drink now with lusty fare, like cold smoked salmon or chorizo.",32.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5052,Holman Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"Dry and bright in acidity, with a clean, silky mouthfeel. Shows fine raspberry and cherry fruit, with a squeeze of tangerine, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now with pork tenderloin, ahi tuna, roasted salmon.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5069,Longoria 2006 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Typical of a fine young S&B; Pinot, this is rather hard and closed in tannins now, although decanting will help coax out the cherry and currant fruit. But it really needs a good 4–6 years.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5070,Apolloni 2006 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5076,Retour 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging. Some whole cluster fermentation and native yeasts contribute to the complexity. A very fine debut.",65.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5086,Balletto 2014 Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in color and body, this is a cool-climate-influenced wine full of spice and life.

5101,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.",43.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5113,Firefly Night 2008 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.",55.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5125,Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",40.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
5148,Iron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",85.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5170,Lincourt 2013 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity.",30.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5172,Patz & Hall 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pungent, spicy earth and cinnamon rise out of the wine's bouquet, inviting one to enjoy a structured expression of cranberry, raspberry and black tea. The tannin structure is well managed and the oak strong, yet integrated. Gap's Crown is among the vineyards that figure into the blend, along with several Dutton family properties. This is fresh and focused.",46.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5176,Balletto 2013 Sexton Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a steep hillside vineyard that is estate owned and farmed, this wine is pungent in dark fruit and black tea.

5178,Cebada 2014 Estate Grown Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very light pink, this rosé offers extremely pleasant and approachable aromas of nectarine, pluot, plum, lime and a dusting of vanilla.

5181,Davies 2013 Nobles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Light and smoothly textured, this beautifully crafted wine is earthy in wild strawberry preserves, mushroom and forest floor. With a tannic grip that subsides in the glass, it's built to age but entirely enjoyable now, showing power and concentration on the finish.",55.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5188,Landmark 2013 Escolle Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dark loam and a slate-driven minerality restrain the concentrated black raspberry and black currant ripeness on the nose of this elegant wine, made by a Sonoma-based group co-founded in 1972 by a descendant of tractor-maker John Deere. Lots of eucalyptus and purple sage shrubbery on the palate spices up the soft, luscious blackberry and olallieberry fruit core.",35.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5189,Last Light 2013 Derbyshire Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"This wine from an extreme coastal vineyard is framed by earthy notes of turned black loam as well as a cherry blossom ripeness, with a laid-back sagebrush element and touch of olive. There's a lot of thyme and marjoram on the palate, as well as orange rinds, plum peel, barely ripe cranberry fruit and a graphite tension.",34.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5191,Loring Wine Company 2013 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Ah, the beautiful fruit aromas, polished texture, ripe but tangy flavors and supreme balance make this an elegant and delicious wine. This is not showy, but slightly reserved, as very little spicy oak is showing through, yet the wine's vibrance and purity keep begging for another sip.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

5275,Thomas George 2014 Cresta Ridge Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Minty bay leaf and leather define this wine in a savory, earthy way, with a strong notion of forest floor at its core.

5323,Copain Wines 2009 Monument Tree Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Outstanding. So dry and elegant, with such a deft, delicate texture, yet so explosive in fruit and spice.

5324,Copain Wines 2009 Wentzel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Brilliantly dry and rich in acidity, this Pinot feels very refined in the mouth.

5353,3Fools 2008 Fools Gold Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Very light, this is scented with fresh bread dough and shows a cherry soda pop flavor. Pretty, light and simple on entry, it feels stripped of depth and disappears quickly in the mouth.",22.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
5355,Byron 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"A raw, dry Pinot, marked by thin cherry and tobacco flavors, and a scour of acidity and alcohol. The texture is nice and silky, and the finish is clean. Drink up.",17.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
5381,MacPhail 2013 Wildcat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's a touch of reduction on the nose of this wine, which otherwise offers a nutty profile that's somewhat shut down. Oaky and smoky, it has a bit of minty chocolate on the thick, full-bodied palate.",49.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
5414,Tamber Bey 2015 Walala Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation. Reductive notes of diesel oak give way to juicy, stemmy and grippy characteristics, marked most pronounced by flavors of black cherry, raspberry and black tea.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5415,Tantara 2015 Tondre Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This bottling explores the more concentrated side of Pinot Noir, with hearty aromas of balsamic fig sauce, cooked berries, clove and rum cake. Roasted blackberry clusters and charred figs show on the sip alongside potent baking spices, making for a rich and heavy expression, although leveling acidity pounds into the finish.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
5423,Torii Mor 1998 Balcombe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Starts off with softly perfumed cherries and dried leaves, then turns strongly piny on the palate. Finishes long, with tart cranberry and bitter-chocolate notes. Some excellent elements, including a lush yet structured mouthfeel, but some tasters will find the intense pine-bough flavor distracting.",38.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
5425,Erath 1998 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Snappy and full of raspberry and cedar aromas. It’s mouthfilling and juicy, with a stylish lean edge to it. Puckery on the palate, with a right-on mix of acidity, fruit and oak. It delivers the goods, not missing a twist or turn along the way, and in the final analysis, it’s fairly large, packing a solid punch of berry fruit.",24.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
5426,Evesham Wood 1998 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.",24.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
5429,Bear Creek 1998 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.",30.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
5434,Andrew Rich 1998 Les Vigneaux Corral Creek Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5435,Argyle 1998 Spirit House Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"For those who like their Pinot oaky, this may be just the ticket. It starts out with caramel, coffee and chocolate aromas skillfully matched with sour cherries and a bouquet garni of green herbs. It then turns ever oakier on the palate, with a near-syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with toasty oak-driven spice notes and an herbaceous edge.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5438,Tualatin Estate 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years.",24.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5439,Cristom 1998 Louise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dark in color, almost pure purple; the bouquet carries some heavy oak, with aromas of toast and vanilla. It’s also a little sauvage. Rich and chocolaty, but also quite sweet. It’s deep and woody overall—the vanilla and oak are very prominent, maybe too much so for many people.",39.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5444,Cooper Mountain 1998 20th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This organic bottling marks Cooper’s 20th year, and it’s a tantalizing, high-strung, dusty wine, with a true Pinot nose full of raspberries and cinnamon. Plenty of verve on the palate, which emphasizes fruit and more fruit. The frame is sleek, but it capably carries the wine’s zip.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5446,Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",28.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5447,Adelsheim 1998 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
5479,Sonoma River 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Wrapped in an ethereal texture, this straightforward wine offers savory cranberry, strawberry and rhubarb around earth and spice. Medium bodied and robust, it finishes smooth and clean.",20.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
5501,Nicholson Ranch 2012 Cactus Hill Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Cherry, cinnamon and vanilla play on the light-bodied, softly layered palate of this estate wine that develops flavor and aroma over time in the glass.

5502,Wedell Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Cherry blossom and wild berries show on the nose of this appellation blend by a longtime boutique producer, who flies far under the radar even within the region. The palate shows plum skin, tart dark berry and barely ripe red-currant flavors, along with ground espresso, juniper and sandalwood.",75.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5503,Winderlea 2013 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The old-vine estate vineyard delivers a well-balanced, elegant wine that shows mineral and steel along with tart berry fruit. Despite a much lighter vintage than 2012, there is enough density and depth to reward some additional cellar time.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5509,Angela Estate 2013 Pinot Noir,"The label does not bear the name Angela Vineyard, but the fruit is estate grown. This is a tight, focused, young red wine, with tangy raspberry fruit that touches on black cherry. Vivid and penetrating, it needs plenty of time to breathe, and as it does it reveals subtle layers of mocha and caramel. This has the bones to age. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5510,Archery Summit 2013 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago.

5511,Archery Summit 2013 Whole Cluster Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Roughly 75% of the fruit was fermented with the stems, using native yeast.

5512,Arista 2013 U.V. Lucky Well Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a Ulises Valdez-farmed vineyard, along the same fence line as Valdez's Silver Eagle, this smoky, succulent wine has a reductive quality that will benefit from more time in bottle. Blackberry, strawberry and earth provide a fleshy aspect of intrigue. Cellar through 2023.",64.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5515,Bethel Heights 2013 Casteel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A barrel by barrel selection results in this reserve-level cuvée. Round, forward, spicy and toasty, it's a solid, almost chunky style with bold black-cherry fruit. Barrel aging brings up highlights of coffee and toast. Think duck confit with this bottle, and enjoy it over the next few years.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5525,Pali 2013 Rancho La Vina Pinot Noir (Sta.

Aromatic, with entwined scents of cocoa powder, rose petals and earth, it is delicate but beautifully defined with raspberry/cherry fruit, underscored with wet stone. It is a graceful wine with a decade of life ahead. Drink now through 2025.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
5534,Erath 2006 Hyland Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Among Erath's dizzying array of single vineyard and other designated Pinot Noirs, it is almost impossible to single out the real players.

5636,Dr. Loosen & J. Christopher 2007 Appassionata Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here, but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience.",75.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
5637,Gary Farrell 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California.

5646,The Eyrie Vineyards 2000 Marguerite Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter.

It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H.

5900,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow.

6093,Hawley 2010 Estines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a very big, rich, extracted Pinot. While it's undeniably delicious, it's so stuffed with cherry-pie filling, black raspberry, mocha and cola flavors, it lacks subtlety, especially at this price.

Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity.

6317,Ramspur 2012 Otton Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense.

6711,Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"There is not much going on here. As with most California Pinots in this price range, the Erath is a stripped-down, pale and insubstantial take on the grape.

7022,Rutz 1999 Martinelli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),". Nice drinking wine, dry and silky, with generous berry and herb flavors and a tasteful touch of fine oak.

7691,Cakebread 2014 Two Creeks Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Great fruit concentration and depth give power to this full-bodied wine from Cakebread, better known for its Napa-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Not tricked up with too much oak, it tastes energized, deep and layered. Black cherry, rhubarb and cedar fan out across the palate, lingering a long time on the finish. Best from 2018.",42.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
7705,Alma Rosa 2006 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is a very good wine, albeit with some coarseness to the tannins at this time. It's also a little earthy and mushroomy. But there's a solid core of black cherry, red currant, mocha and tangerine zest flavors. The vineyard is near Sanford & Benedict, whose Pinots require time to come around. This young wine should do interesting things.",49.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
7707,MacPhail 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Very dry and elegantly silky, this Pinot, from one of the best vineyards in the valley, brims with cherry, red currant, cola, licorice and peppery spice flavors.

7749,Walt 2011 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Delicious and soft in raspberries, cherries and the sweet vanilla and the cinnamon toast of new oak, this is a charming Pinot to drink now. It's light and airy in the mouth. Perfect with a simply prepared grilled steak or lamb chop.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
7756,Mansfield-Dunne 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"If fruit were the only thing that counted, this Pinot would get a perfect score, with an upfront burst of cherries, strawberries and raspberries. The oak appliqué is rich and balanced, and the tannin-acid structure is just fine. Its powerful fruit notes suggest to give it 6–7 years.",48.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
7761,MacMurray Ranch 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
7801,Alma Rosa 2007 La Encantada Vineyard - Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Softly tannic and direct in jammy blackberry, cherry and red plum flavors, with chocolate overtones that have a candied, sugary edge. Not showing a great deal of complexity now, but could evolve in a few years. Hard to predict.",49.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
7807,Keller Estate 2006 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a big, rich, thick Pinot that almost seems more like a southern Rhône wine, it's that dark and full-bodied. The flavors are ripe and jammy, of pie-filling black cherries, black raspberries, cola, anise and smoky oak.",75.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
7808,Merry Edwards 2006 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.",60.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
7815,Etude 2006 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance. Drink now and over the next few years.",60.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
7823,Stephen Ross 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is somewhat lean, but its elegantly tailored in its brisk acidity and dryness. While the cherry and berry flavors are modest, the wine's austerity makes it versatile with an enormous range of foods.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
7906,Glenora 2012 Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"A pretty spray of cherry blossom perfume runs from start to finish on this off-dry rosé. It's a bit honeyed on the palate, with ripe, luscious cherry flavor, but it's quaffable and undeniably tasty.",14.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
7910,Ancien 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This cleanly made wine has potential to live long in the cellar. Intensely focused aromas of black raspberry and black plum combine with crushed asphalt and a touch of purple flowers on the nose. The tightly wound palate slowly reveals tart boysenberry, char and pine resin, flavors that the firm structure will reveal even more deliciously with time. Drink 2018–2029.",52.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413

7929,Talisman 2014 Sadie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is the producer's first release from this site.

There is both vibrant energy and tannic grip to the palate, with dense, dark cranberry, tangy fruit skins, a touch of vanilla and a minty fennel element on the finish.",75.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7945,Albatross Ridge 2014 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. There is great energy on the palate, with mulberry and elderberry flavors enhanced by light coffee, soil and fennel bulbs.",55.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7951,Gary Farrell 2014 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus.",75.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7954,Gary Farrell 2014 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Bringing together multiple sites in one wine, this provides a fine example of the sum equalling more than the parts.

Rita Hills),"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity.",50.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7956,Melville 2014 Sandy's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This winery's bottlings manage to pack bright, fruity energy and a wide array of herbs and seasonings into the same lithe frame. In this case, sagebrush and chaparral meet candied red cherry and dark pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows lots of oregano, thyme and bay leaf against a ripe cranberry base, with touches of black tea and rosehip adding to the complexity.",50.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7959,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait.",65.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
7995,Pessagno 2006 Lucia Highlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years.",28.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
8012,Stoller 2010 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously.",25.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
8019,Erath 2010 La Nuit Magique Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort—along with the Battle Creek bottling—in 2010.

8033,Aiken 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years.",55.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
8034,Anam Cara 2010 Mark V Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The Mark V bottling usually gets the most new oak, but in this light vintage the wood has been kept in check.

Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020.",90.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8063,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This mountaintop winery puts much effort in single-vineyard expressions, but this blend rivals even those, with nose-tingling aromas of concentrated hibiscus and pomegranate, plus dried sour cherries and graphite. Prominent herbs like oregano, thyme and dried sage mix with eucalyptus and menthol on the palate, where soft cranberry fruit serves as backbone.",36.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8078,Spindrift Cellars 2007 Spinnaker Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This joins the happily increasing ranks of Oregon Pinots under $20 that can successfully compete with entry-level bottles from New Zealand, California and Burgundy.

8087,Arcane Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade.",24.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
8095,Ken Wright 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.",25.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
8111,Rex Hill 2011 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage.

8226,Gypsy Dancer 2010 Tribute Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Extra time in bottle has proved rewarding for this varietally pure, aromatic, even pungent wine.

8259,Kokomo 2009 Winemaker's Reserve Peters Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes jammy all the way through, with raspberry and cherry flavors that start and end sweet and sugary. The problem isn't the ripeness, it's the balance and control throughout the palate experience.

8308,Owen Roe 2014 Sojourner Vineyard Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries.

8373,Soléna 2013 Grande Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.",28.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
8396,Tom Eddy 2012 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Dark-colored and deeply flavored, this full-bodied wine smells smoky and meaty, tastes savory, feels firm and appropriately tannic. Showing the more robust, hearty side of Pinot, it can be paired successfully with most opulent meat and fowl dishes.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
8399,YNOT 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious",26.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
8423,Joseph Phelps 2013 Quarter Moon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a 100% estate wine from the producer's cool-climate sites near the town of Freestone. Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops. Soft and mellow, it's also feral and funky, with a strong essence of mushroomy forest floor.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8436,Merry Edwards 2013 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange. It is softly voluptuous and velvety, though young, with a biting chewiness that should mellow in the cellar. Drink now through 2028.",57.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8444,Chenoweth 2013 Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This wine is from the Chenoweth grape-growing family and is made from three of its finest vineyard sites: Chenoweth Ranch, Treehouse and Bootleggers, all special spots that have produced grapes for special producers. Here, the result is a smooth and velvety expression of juicy cherry and raspberry, given freshness via vibrant acidity.",65.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8445,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Classic Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices. The palate hones in on that Mediterranean spice character, with Kalamata olives blending into lavender, exotic mulberry and thyme-laced cherry-plum sauce.",32.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8450,Fiddlehead 2011 Lollapalooza Fiddlestix Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Elegant and silky on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of pressed violet, rose bud, grape candy, cherry blossom and lilac. There is a lot of cinnamon and star anise spice on the palate as well as a strong touch of licorice that's laid across deep olallieberry fruit and a lavender florality.",80.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8451,Foretell 2012 Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Stemmy wet forest and a distinct note of mushroom opens this exotic wine, a full-bodied and concentrated expression of the coast.

8474,Talbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is not a successful Sleepy Hollow Vineyard bottling. The cold vintage took its toll, resulting in a wine whose cherry and tart cranberry flavors are cut through with a streak of green veggies. Drink up.",42.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
8482,Donum 2013 Ten Oaks Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Another tiny production, made in a different style from many of the other designates released by the producer this year, Ten Oaks is named for the, yes, 10 trees bordering the vineyard. Medium in tannin and oak, with a surprising lightness of being, it shows a citrus-like quality that makes it refreshing, while a sublime texture keeps rolling along the tongue.",72.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
8491,Maggy Hawk 2013 Stormin' Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The color of this wine is deep and dark, and the aromas and flavors both have lots of plump black cherry, baking spice and clove tones. It's dry, full bodied and pretty massive in terms of mouthfeel, so this is not a delicate flower and is best enjoyed with heartier fare or after some time to open.",66.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
8495,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling.

8549,Gros Ventre 2013 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is an earthy, ethereal, lighter-bodied wine.

8555,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Outcrop Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Outcrop was planted in 1982.

8559,WildAire 2014 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Coconut scents convene around ripe purple fruits—blueberry and plum—which abound here.

8562,Elk Cove 2014 Mount Richmond Pinot Noir,"This deeply flavored wine bursts forth with ripe blueberry, plum and cherry fruit.

8565,Bethel Heights 2014 Flat Block Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),This limited block selection comes from own-rooted vines planted in 1979. Full-fruited flavors combine into a fresh and lush mix of berries and cherries with a citrusy kick. There's a tropical punch sensibility combined with the texture and depth of a very fine Pinot. The tannins are polished and in perfect proportion.,58.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
8582,Fess Parker 2015 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Fresh and easy aromas of raspberry, plum candy, dark rose petals, boysenberry and allspice show on the nose of this clonal study.

8583,Keller 2014 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a wildly exotic wine, vibrantly abuzz in cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, a side note of barnyard-like earth and pretty rose petal. Tight-grained acidity remains firm in the glass and supportive of a grittiness of texture, notes of clove and black tea spiked throughout.",45.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8598,Elizabeth Rose 2012 Pinot Noir (Yountville),"Rustic earth and forest emanate from this Pinot Noir, a rare find from Yountville, a growing area more devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon. From organically grown grapes, the wine has a smooth taste of wild strawberry and is not overly complex, the finish abbreviated and the wine on the lower price range of the variety.",20.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
8600,Ron Rubin 2012 Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a cool-climate pocket within the larger Russian River Valley where even sparkling wine grapes thrive, this Pinot is muted somewhat, its flavors darker and oakier than expected, earthy yet shy in spice",25.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
8612,Bonneau 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Earthy and recalling the aromas of a woodshed or old barn, this tastes of darker fruit. Relatively lean on the palate, it ends as abruptly as it starts.",42.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
8632,Au Bon Climat 2010 Talley Vineyard Rincon Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8648,Kirkland Signature 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in fairly large quantities for a wide swath of palates, this wine is grippy in tannins and possessed of sizable weight and power.",13.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413

8670,Foxen 2013 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",64.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
8677,Antiquum Farm 2013 Juel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot.

8683,Della 2013 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.",70.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
8696,Winderlea 2013 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits.

8732,Riverbench 2013 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"One of the winery's special block bottlings, this shows purple aromas of blackberry, violet and lilac alongside graphite and toasted oak.

8747,Adler Fels 2014 The Eagle Rock Pinot Noir,"This blend of 76% Sta.

8749,Anthony Nappa 2014 Nemesis Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"Pinot Noir is something winemaker Anthony Nappa makes only in rare vintages.

8800,Le Cadeau 2014 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix. Root beer and sweet cola elements combine, and there is little doubt that, good as it is already, this is a wine to cellar. Drink now–2028.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
8802,Loring Wine Company 2014 Rancho La Vina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Graphite, rose petals, vanilla and a strong yet not over-exuberant black cherry quality pump up the nose of this decadent bottling by Brian Loring.

8817,Artesa 2013 Single Vineyard Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Light in color and ethereally earthy, this wine opens with delicate notes of rose petal and allspice.

8834,Russian Hill 2005 Tara Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate. On the plus side, it's a dry, rich wine, with oodles of cherries, blackberries and cinnamon-spiced punch.",45.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
8844,Lander-Jenkins 2016 Pinot Noir (California),"A strong oak aroma and a rather dense chewy texture make this wine a bit of a show-off, while spicy oaky flavors dominate the fruit component. It has definite tannins and a touch of astringency on the finish.",18.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413

8957,Stanton Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut.

8980,Roessler 2008 Griffin's Lair Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins.

9114,Silvan Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",20.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

9160,Fetzer 1998 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (California),"About a third of this is Bien Nacido Vineyard (Santa Barbara) fruit; the rest comes from Sonoma.

9170,Brophy Clark 1998 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This light Pinot offers an elegant nose with tart cherry and leathery, earthy accents. It opens to a like palate, but the wine has an essentially lean, even sharp character, with rather high acidity for the thin fruit. Solid winemaking keeps the Pinot Noir character correct here, but the vintage's fruit essentially lacks the desired depth or ripeness.",20.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
9172,Elizabeth Chambers 2011 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Graceful, and elegant, this offers achingly pure, tart cherry fruit, accented with notes of compost, butter and nutmeg.

9192,Ground Boots 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This wine by Gypsy Canyon's Deborah Hall raises money for dogs in Thailand, but it's certainly no gimmick.

9199,Donkey & Goat 2013 Broken Leg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Vivid, bright red cherry and cranberry notes create the main aroma and flavor impressions, while crisp acidity and lip-smacking tannins make a firm texture. On subsequent sips, more complexity and depth come out as the crisp, austere structure holds its ground. This is tantalizing, and should improve through 2019.",54.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9211,Inman Family 2011 Thorn Ridge Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This vineyard is in the Sebastopol Hills, one of the cooler parts of the valley. With a cool vintage, the wine feels a bit tough with prominent tannins and acidity. It's a balanced, elegant wine, however, with flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and heirloom tomato. Drink now–2016.",68.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9212,Longplay 2011 Lia's Vineyard Hi-Tone Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This cuvée features grapes from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's a light, elegant mix of pomegranate and cherry pie flavors with plenty of natural acidity behind it. Cola and dried herb highlights add complexity, and a persistent minerality buoys the finish.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9214,Marimar Estate 2010 La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is sourced from grapes grown in an organic estate vineyard in the heart of the Green Valley. Flavors of raspberries and pomegranates are delicious, and new French oak marries seamlessly with the fruit. Vibrant coastal acidity makes everything sing. If there's an off note, it's a mushroom and veggie note, courtesy of the cold vintage. The wine is already softening in tannins so drink now.",44.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9230,Schug 2009 Rouge de Noirs Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is like a sparking Shiraz from Australia. It's pretty much as dark in color as a red wine, with a full body and a raspberry pie flavor. The palate is a little bit scouring and sweet, along with the classic yeastiness of a sparkling wine.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
9243,Chime 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"What a great Pinot, and look at that price. The wine is translucent in ruby hue, dry, silky in texture and crisp in acids, showing the textural hallmarks of a fine coastal bottling. The raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors are delicious and complex. A terrific value. Production was 1,100 cases.",19.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9249,Thomas Fogarty 2008 Rapley Trail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a very nice Pinot Noir for drinking soon. It's dry, silky and somewhat earthy and herbal, but turns rich in cherries toward the finish. Feels elegant and complex all the way through.",50.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9251,Churchill Cellars 2008 Bella Luna Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Give this polished Pinot an hour or two of decanting and serve it now with a good steak, or try prosciutto-wrapped dates for an exotic appetizer. It's dry, rich and spicy, with ripe cherry, red currant, cola and bacon flavors, edged with sweet, smoky sandalwood.",45.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9252,Churchill Cellars 2008 Bella Sonoma Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot is made in a lighter style, but it's complex and interesting. It's marked by dryness and acidic crispness. The raspberry, cola and persimmon flavors are enriched with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Seems best now, but it could surprise over the next six years.",39.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9305,MacPhail 2010 Wildcat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a full-bodied Pinot Noir that's a little high in alcohol, but that's the cost of all the richness. The flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pie, sweet date and smoky, buttery vanilla are frankly addictive. Lovely pairings would be grilled salmon steaks with a fruity salsa or lamb chops in a wine reduction sauce.",49.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9310,Cambria 2010 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a big, fleshy wine, with evident tannins and acidity that give it bite and structure. The flavors are ripe and pure, suggesting red and black cherry pie filling, with lots of dusty spice and a hint of sweet oak. It will be very nice now and over the next 4–5 years. And with more than 22,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",25.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9323,Laetitia 2009 Les Galets Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This offers big bursts of ripe cherry and raspberry jam, but that richness is complicated by minerality, earthiness and firm tannins, giving it true complexity. It's not very subtle, and you might think it's a Grenache if you didn't know what you were tasting, but it's certainly delicious. Drink over the next few years.",60.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9331,Nefarious 2013 Madrona Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lake Chelan's Nefarious stretches out with this impressive Oregon Pinot Noir. Stiff and compact when first opened, it fills out nicely. The fruit runs from pomegranate to mountain berry to plum, with a touch of peppery spice. The midpalate continues to broaden and gather strength through a long finish.",37.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9335,Sarah's Vineyard 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Deeply brooding notes of crushed violets, rose petals, black cherries, thyme and sagebrush make for a manly take on this often feminine grape. Elderberry fruit shows on the palate, as do more violets and lilacs, dried mint, sagebrush, menthol and pine-needle flavors.",36.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9336,Soléna 2014 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Young, spicy and forward, this immediately accessible wine is a bowl of cherry candy, backed with pineapple highlights from natural acidity. It's full in the mouth, still with primary fruit flavors, but the structure to age gracefully over the next five to eight years.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9343,Hyland 2014 Coury Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate.",60.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9350,Elk Cove 2014 Goodrich Pinot Noir,"This is the first time this recently purchased vineyard has been featured as an Elk Cove designate. Planted in 2007, it's just coming into its own. The young fruit is tight and tangy—a mix of raspberry and black cherry. Forward, bright and lightly spicy, it's nicely focused effort with some high acid snap to the finish.",60.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9352,Vidon Vineyard 2013 Hans Clone Pommard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Softly smoky, with pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, this strikes a lovely balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and seductive, the flavors seamless and the balance spot on.",50.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9377,Summerland 2010 Vintners Select Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Heavy and dull, with a soft texture framing cherry, berry and spice flavors. Pinot's famously silky texture is there, but the wine isn't offering much else.",35.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
9399,Cellars 33 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a blend of grapes sourced from three vineyard sites, including Keefer, one of the producer's vineyard designates, this wine displays a light red color. It has a noticeably supple texture, a soft expression of cranberry and red cherry accented by black tea.",33.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9405,Donkey & Goat 2013 Helluva Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has a medium-deep color with a slightly purple rim. Fresh and fruity aromas bring to mind strawberry juice, tart cherries and rose-hip tea. With medium body and enough tannin for a velvety texture, this well-mannered, slightly restrained wine keeps asking for another sip.",30.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9414,Phelps Creek 2007 Le Petit Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"For an inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a lovely, expansive aroma that mingles rose petals, strawberry, white chocolate and cola. This is elegant, supple and entirely approachable, with none of the hard, earthy, vegetal or bitter character that can often characterize inexpensive Pinots. Think of a really good village Burgundy from a ripe vintage such as 2005, but at a much better price.",18.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
9415,Ponzi 2006 Tavola Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Soft, silky and seductive, this qualifies as an outstanding everyday Pinot (by Oregon standards) that offers more subtle scent and flavor than most under-$30 bottles. Violets, cherries and star anise are mixed in the nose; the palate adds herbal and earthy nuances.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
9432,Trione 2008 River Road Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This Pinot certainly has lots of concentrated fruit, with an intensity of cherry and raspberry jam, pomegranates and cola. It's also well oaked, to judge from the strong layer of buttered cinnamon toast. Feels strong and indelicate now, with a punch of acidity, but could mellow over the next 2–3 years.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
9435,Pfendler 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"An example of a soft, accessible Pinot whose rich, ripe flavors are the main attraction. Brims with cola, cherry, cranberry and red licorice flavors. Seems best over the next 2–3 years.",45.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
9521,Expression 39 2013 Ordway Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A sense of depth and gravity imbues this full-bodied and richly flavored wine. It smells woodsy and mushroomy along with lots of ripe plum. It feels broad and plump on the palate, is nicely supported by moderate tannins and acidity, and has a lingering finish.",50.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9523,Fritz 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation. Layered, with a twinge of yeasty baked bread, it has a strong personality, stemmy and feral, with a lasting linger of grenadine.",40.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9535,Chêne 2014 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"An intriguingly and wondrously unique nose offers baked plum, shaved kola nut, pressed red rose buds, cinnamon and dried tea leaves. The palate carries that array of scents forward, showing root beer and more kola nut as well as tobacco lead, slate and slightly sour black plum skins.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9561,Mahoney 2009 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A tight, dry and somewhat one-dimensional Pinot Noir. It offers cherry, cola and spice flavors, and is elegantly structured. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, but it's ready for drinking now.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
9605,Lucienne 2012 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
9629,Adelsheim 2008 Quarter Mile Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Sadly, just 44 cases were produced, from Block 1 of the original estate vineyard. Rhubarb, cherry, cinnamon and suggestions of light tropical fruits are delicately entwined here. It would be easy to skip over the wine's complexity; you must let it breathe open and it will reward you with fascinating, subtle layers that slowly unravel.",90.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
9642,Brogan 2006 Michaela's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",110.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
9643,Calera 2007 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Typically Calera's most luscious, delicious wine in youth. The year 2007 was kind, and the result is a Pinot rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and cola, wrapped into a silky texture, with near perfect acids and tannins. As good as it is now, it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",45.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
9650,Brogan 2007 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"What's so likeable about this Pinot is its dryness, silkiness and elegance. It shows a cool-climate structure, with a bite of acidity and fine tannins, and tantalizing flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and minerals. Should develop in the bottle over the next six years.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9651,Calera 2007 Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9720,Vidon Vineyard 2007 Three Clones Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively.",39.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9736,Pali 2011 Rancho La Viña Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The wine tastes and feels tight and remote now, despite luscious raspberry, strawberry and oak flavors. But the promise is there, with firm tannins, crisp acidity and bracing minerality providing the structure for aging. This should hit its stride between 2015–2017.",56.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9739,Melville 2011 Terraces Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness.",56.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
9749,Big Basin 2012 Alfaro Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9762,Freeman 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is rich and ripe, oozing with black cherry, boysenberry and strawberry jam aromas and flavors. It feels full and rather soft on the palate, as the acidity and tannins appear very mild.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9777,DanCin 2015 Écarté Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA. It's loaded with ripe, fleshy cherry fruit and suggestions of steely minerality, typical of the terroir. Big, full, delicious and nicely balanced, it wraps up with a yummy chocolaty finish.",38.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9778,Decroux 2015 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This bottling's core of black cherry fragrance is wrapped in sugar plum, balsamic, allspice and nutmeg notes, combining elegance and power. Mulberry and wild cherry flavors show on the palate, lifted by baking spice and gingerbread accents and balanced by solid acidity and tannins. A sagebrush note pops on the finish.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9779,Domaine Eden 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This wine's wild raspberry, mace, composting violets, kola nut and musk hints make for a very pretty but extremely complex nose. Fermented with 30% whole clusters, it's energetic on the palate, with dark cranberry and sharp raspberry flavors enhanced by allspice and anise. It has a very long finish.",35.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9783,Fess Parker 2015 Older Barrel Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas. A tight boysenberry note emerges on the palate, dusted with clove and lavender and cut by lively acidity. A thorough and complete wine.",58.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9788,Roark Wine Co. 2015 Burning Creek Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark. It packs bright and fruity raspberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and crushed violet aromas on the nose. The refreshing palate pairs snappy raspberry fruit with fennel pollen and eucalyptus touches.",72.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9789,Lavinea 2014 Elton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead. The old-vine grapes create a skeleton of mineral and acid upon which just-ripe fruit flavors of mulberry, plum and blueberry are placed. Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9790,Lavinea 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This deeply fruited wine is a rich cranberry/purple in hue, and flavors put blueberry and plum front and center. There's a touch of cassis, and the tannins are brushed velvety smooth, while remaining substantial, even muscular. Bergamot, pomegranate and marionberry flavors come through as well, in a lush cascade of spicy fruits.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9791,Lucienne 2015 Hook Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Winemaker Paul Clifton excelled in this vintage, finding the balance between the region's ripe fruit, natural acidity and powerful spice. Baked black cherry, hibiscus, earth, gingerbread and cola notes show on the nose. The palate is creamy and lush, but the acidity is persistent, carrying its dark red fruit and minty chocolate flavors into the finish.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9793,Windrun 2015 Vintage Selection No. 12 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish.",33.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9796,Bethel Heights 2015 Casteel Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"A barrel-selection, top-of-the-line cuvée, this is intensely aromatic with black cherry, soft leather and baking spices in play. Flavors focus in the midpalate, leading into supple tannins and a smattering of cocoa powder. Overall it's a big wine, full flavored, balanced and already drinking very well.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9825,Saxon Brown 2009 Parmelee-Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This small-production single-vineyard Pinot Noir is dry, elegant and may be deceptively simple in its youth. It feels delicate now, almost fragile, with the suggestion of barely ripe cherries and cola that's been left out overnight so it loses its spritz. It's a wine of nuance, not power, and could easily develop dramatically over the next six years.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9833,Gresser 2009 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.",24.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

9847,Bryn Mawr Vineyards 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine's lovely rose petal and strawberry aromas, along with other tart and tangy wild berry notes, gather with appealing weight and length.

9852,Chehalem 2015 Corral Creek Vineyards Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This aromatic wine offers rich fruit and floral scents. It's tart and spicy on the palate, with bright red fruit. Although aged in 42% new and 33% one-year barrels, oak-derived flavors aren't evident. Still, it's a young wine pulling itself together.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9855,Delgado 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Caramel toasted oak contributes a concentrated richness to this full-bodied expression of the coast—a dark brooding offering of baked cherry and cola spice. Underlying acidity and specks of forest floor contribute brightness and complexity that pair well with the fruit.,32.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9856,Dois Irmãos 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Plum, black cherry and mocha cflavors ombine in this smooth, well-integrated wine. It must have seen some time in new oak, and the pretty baking spice accents add length and pleasure to the finish.",35.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
9884,Keller 2011 El Coro Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The tough, earthy taste of raw mushrooms makes this Pinot less than lush. That's despite some good Lifesaver candy raspberry flavors. The grapes are from the estate vineyard, in the Petaluma Gap. Cold vintage, cool growing area, slightly unripe wine.",52.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
9887,MacMurray Ranch 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"With a delicate, silky mouthfeel and bright acidity, this wine fulfils Pinot's basic requirements. It has raspberry, persimmon and mushroom flavors, and also is quite tannic. Drink now, after decanting it for a while.",23.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
9889,Pali 2012 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Intensely ripe raspberry and cherry pie flavors mark this wine. Oak brings even greater richness, in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. The finish is dry, and there's a good burst of acidity. The alcohol is a little hot, but still, it's a nice, silky wine for drinking now.",23.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
9896,Joseph Soggé 2014 DeNatale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light and clear in color, this ethereal and delicate wine is earthy, with a brightness of cherries and a woodsy back note. Subtle in alcohol and power, it provides a food-friendly experience of cardamom and rose petals that makes it pretty on the nose and elusive on the palate.",38.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9901,Torii Mor 2013 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This pure Pommard-clone bottling offers lighter red fruit with highlights of cocoa and baking spices. The balance is good, and this should age well and develop interesting aromatics if cellared. Drink 2018–2025.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9904,R. Stuart & Co. 2013 Vignette Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This unfined and unfiltered wine carries itself lightly, as is appropriate to the vintage and the grape. It's clean and delicate, with light raspberry fruit and hints of leaf and dried herb.",30.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9905,"R. Stuart & Co. 2014 Love, Oregon Pinot Noir (Oregon)","Scents of rose powder and petals come up first, followed by hints of cherries. Then the palate brings raspberries, with a sour-candy tanginess. The cleansing acids and overall balance are pitch perfect.",28.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9907,Spindrift Cellars 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This displays the bright and polished fruit of this excellent vintage. Highlights are pretty cherry and strawberry candy, which touch on cotton-candy charm without becoming sweet or cloying. Just 15% of the wine saw new oak.",22.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9909,Krutz 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source. Clay and chalky earth notes show on the palate, which is very full and rich with tart cherry, black plum and pencil-lead flavors.",40.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9918,Alchemist 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Firm but fully ripe, this mixes black cherry and dark chocolate in a tight and chewy style. It's already showing a slight hint of browning, but aerating it aggressively is recommended, or wait until 2017–2018 before drinking.",28.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
9935,Schug 1998 Heritage Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Specially selected lots account for this top-of-the-line bottling. It's really very good. The fruit tends toward raspberries and cherries, and it's smooth as silk in the mouth. The nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and peppery notes last for a long time on the finish. The difference between this and the typical Carneros bottling is intensity; the fruit is more focused. It's the difference, say, between a flashlight and a laser.",30.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
9941,Schug 1998 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Cherry-berry fruit, spice, a velvety texture and a long finish make for a lovely wine, soft and limpid, but with underlying power. The tannins are as light as air, but somehow substantial anyway. The framework is exceptional. You'll be smacking your lips over this beauty.",18.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
9961,Tortoise Creek 2015 Mission Grove Pinot Noir (California),"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture.",12.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
9965,Balletto 2014 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Dank earth, dark berry and cherry are the standouts in this wine, which is a bit more lush than some of the producer's vineyard-designates. Approachable in its acidity and oak, it's a good place to start at a somewhat reasonable entry price.",29.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
9975,Castle Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Medium body and an attractive earthy, oaky flavor profile make this wine a little different from the norm and a great value.

10068,Lost Canyon 2012 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Bold notions of strawberry and cherry form around a robust core of oak and tannin, giving this rounded, approachable wine a medium to full-figured build.

10077,Storm 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a worthy followup to Storm's fine 2008 bottling. Although it's not quite as rich, it does provide a pleasing Pinot Noir experience.

10111,Amalie Robert 2011 The Uncarved Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime.

10128,Chehalem 2014 Wind Ridge Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Steely and tight, this block selection reveals a chalky flavor of citric acid that overshadows the fruit, which turns thin in the finish. Ample aeration helps a bit.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
10135,Mollie 2012 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This wine, made by a relative of the Jocko's Steak House family, is vibrant.

10202,Coeur de Terre 2014 Abby's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age.",65.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
10203,Coeur de Terre 2014 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Crafted principally from estate-grown fruit, this has the complexity and downright panache of a far more expensive bottling. Mixed brambly red fruits combine seamlessly, punching through to a lingering finish etched in minerals. What a terrific value!",22.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
10204,Davis Bynum 2014 Jane's Vineyard Clone 23 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Compostable earth marks the entry of this clonal exploration—a robust, full-bodied and ripely warm wine.With mint, pine and black tea accents, it offers wild raspberry and rhubarb fruit, bringing a homemade pie to mind.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
10205,Demetria 2014 Le Belier Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The nose of this bottling is pleasantly earthy and rustic, with composting rose petal, forest floor, snappy cranberry and iron-tinged aromas.

10222,Purple Hands 2015 Kropf Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"When first opened, this seemed a bit shallow, but it blossomed with breathing time into a lovely brambly berry-soaked wine with a full-bodied palate.

10227,Phillips Hill 2012 Boontling Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has a medium-garnet color, not overly dark, and the aromas are a bit restrained.

10237,Carden 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Firm and flavorful, this brings well-ripened raspberry and black cherry fruit into focus.

10244,DanCin 2012 Pas de Trois Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Grapes from three vineyards (estate, Hyland and Durant) and seven different clones are blended here, then aged for 14 months in 40% new French oak. At first sniff it's more steely than oaky, with chunky flavors of red fruits firmly underscored with highlights of earth and stem. There's a vein of black licorice also, and the wine leaves the impression that waiting until 2016–2017 will help bring out its best.",34.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
10248,Foursight 2012 Charles Vineyard Zero Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Not too deep in color or overly effusive in aroma, this nevertheless full-bodied wine has fresh red cherry and plum flavors backed by firm acidity and tannins.

Rita Hills),"Very yeasty and slightly clouded in the glass, this wine by regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost shows buttered plums, rising sourdough bread and freshly picked scarlet red rose petals on the nose.

10291,Bjornstad 2009 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"So delicious to drink now, it's easy to overlook the complexity and ageworthiness of this Pinot.

10297,Ermisch 2010 Eréndira Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine.",35.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10298,Fig 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Created by Joshua Klapper, the fine winemaker at La Fenetre, for Santa Monica's Fig Restaurant, this wine is balanced in alcohol and subtle, but complex in its array of fruits, spices, earth, oak, tannins and acids. If you're in the area, check it out.",34.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10303,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 114 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Bolinas-based Sean Thackrey's new project, Cassiopeia is centered on one block from a single Anderson Valley vineyard. His quest was to see what four different Pinot Noir clones on one rootstock, all the same age, and treated otherwise similarly, could become once turned into wine. This, the 114, is lightly rendered, though deceptively full and meaty, tasting of dark cherry and herb.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10306,Siduri 2011 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A huge wine, massively extracted with raspberry and cherry jam fruit, with complex hints of mocha, cola, vanilla, buttered toast and wood spice.

10309,Whitcraft 2011 Pence Ranch Clone 828 Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness. The vineyard is within a touchdown pass of the Santa Rita Hills boundary. Drink now–2020.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

10326,Erath 2006 Bishop Creek Pinot Noir,"The first Bishop Creek designation from Erath, this dark-toned, deep and concentrated Pinot Noir is one to cellar. The fruit is seamless, sappy and dense, suggesting a mix of ripe berries. Fourteen months in French oak, about 40% new, seems just right, as the barrel notes of toast and coffee dance around the juicy berry flavors without smothering them.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10327,Buena Vista 2006 Ramal Vineyard Swan Selection Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a supple, polished and delicious Pinot Noir, so drinkable on its own or with a nice steak.

As beautiful as it is now, it should slowly evolve over the next eight years.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10329,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2005 Laurène Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
10353,Prodigal 2015 Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of three clones shows plump red-plum and hibiscus aromas on the nose as well as sharp cinnamon, cola and sumac spices.

10361,Anthony Nappa 2014 Shared Table Farm Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"Primary, concentrated raspberry and cherry flavors pierce through the core of this rich, fruity Pinot.

10397,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2015 Trouble Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There's a funky, foxy note and a sour edge to this wine, which seems disjointed, or perhaps still showing a little bottle shock. Component flavors include sour plum and wild cherry, and the finish is leathery and tannic.",30.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
10420,Furthermore 2010 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Flavor wasn't a problem with this Pinot, which comes from a great vineyard. It floods the mouth with raspberries and cherries. There's also lots of oak influence, in the form of buttered toast and sweet wood sap. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in fancy deliciousness.",40.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
10436,Ten Acre 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a sound Pinot Noir, well-made and clean, with some complexity.

10437,Amelle 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"With a soft mouthfeel and sweet, ripe raspberry, red currant, cola and oak flavors, this is a Pinot to drink now. It would be a mere candy bar, except for an earthy, grounding quality.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
10492,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Bernau Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
10497,Thistle 2007 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Thistle makes a spicy, herbal, earthy style of Pinot Noir, so don't look for sweet, ripe, jammy flavors. The fruit tastes like the tart, wild berries of the Northwest, and it's backed with tart acidity and chewy tannins. But the concentration, focus and detail of the wine elevate it, and it persists in the mouth far longer than you anticipate.",24.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
10515,Stoller 2007 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),This is a standout in this price range. The well-defined cherry/cranberry fruit is wrapped in fresh rosemary and tarragon spices; the tannins are polished and there is an intriguing scent of pine forest that permeates the finishing flavors also. Such complexity is not always found in wines twice as expensive.,25.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413

10544,Toretti's 2010 Inocencio Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Sharp and minty, this wine has some underripe notes, yet the flavor of peppery black cherry tastes jammy. The alcohol is high and somewhat unbalanced, which gives the wine a heavy mouthfeel.",44.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
10584,Witching Stick 2012 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A distinctive mint character comes up in the aroma and carries through the flavors of this fruity and full-bodied wine.

10632,Expression 38 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Feral earth and forest highlight a plush, lush texture of full-bodied ripeness and voluptuous personality in this wine from the famous site.

10749,Pali 2007 Boer Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Beautifully rich and ripe in cherries, raspberries and sweet smoky cedar, this Pinot is fully drinkable now, although decanting will help.

10760,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Cherries and strawberries abound in this elegant wine.

10768,Coeur de Terre 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A lightly funky whiff of the chicken yard underlies the aromatics, but for most tasters it will be an asset, as it does not block the pretty cherry fruit. These forward, appealing cherry flavors, matched to natural acidity and lengthened with that whiff of funk, make for a delicious and value-priced effort.",22.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

11011,Rusack 2008 Rancho Santa Rosa Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Rusack's best 2008 Pinot comes from this great vineyard that displays such fine Santa Rita Hills character. It's ripe enough in cherries to satisfy, and also brisk in acidity, with complex mineral and herb notes, and the oak barrel layering is perfect. Lovely now for its silky texture, and will develop over the next 5–7 years.",45.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
11018,Kason 2007 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This reserve is the best of Kason's 2007 releases, with cranberry fruit, minty spice, moderate tannins and overall balance. The thinness of the vintage shows through, and this will need to be drunk now, rather than cellared. Aging in 80% new French oak puts some toast into the finish.",28.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
11020,M. Autumn 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the dryness and crispness you want in a fine coastal Pinot Noir, with good flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranate juice and sandalwood.

11075,La Merika 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Shy aromas of graphite, rust, dried black cherries and a slightly sour element greet the nose on this wine. The palate offers rose petal and cherry flavors, proving a tad one-dimensional but easily quaffable.",15.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
11167,Kings Ridge 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Cranberry, spice and fresh herb give this peppery Pinot plenty of flavor interest. Definitely on the earthy and herbal side, this juicy wine is a good go-to bottle for everyday drinking.",17.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
11175,Hawkins Cellars 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.",22.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
11207,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A fairly subdued, mostly mineral-driven nose characterizes this wine by the Santa Clara Valley-based producer founded in 1978, with bits of brick and graphite most prevalent. The flavors are more prominent, with allspice-laced cherries, toasted oak and iron.",32.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
11257,Windy Bay 2011 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Most of what this wine has to offer comes through its enchanting aromas of mint, cranberry, and toasty spice. The palate—light, delicate, and tart—can't quite deliver on this promise. Still, a varietally correct Oregon Pinot Noir at this price? Yes, please!",14.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
11264,River Road 2011 Stephanie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Pretty good  Pinot for the price, showing Russian River silkiness, dryness and acidic structure. The cola, sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors are classic, if a little thin. Drink up.",20.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413

11303,Left Coast Cellars 2014 Right Bank Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tart raspberry fruit limned with orange peel provides excellent definition across the palate.

11312,Native Flora 2014 Next Time Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light pretty red fruits mingle here, supported with tart citrus. It's an elegant, rather steely style, and one that needs aeration and a bit of patience. The best drinking window should be 2020 through 2025.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

11361,Foley 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Hedonistic notes of hot cherry pie prime the nose on this wine, which gains complexity thanks to sagebrush, eucalyptus and black slate aromas.

11403,McManis 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"In Pinot Noir, you get what you pay for. Granted, MaManis's 2010 is a pretty simple wine.

11414,Demetria 2007 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A beautifully balanced, elegant Pinot Noir from a great appellation that's ready to drink now. It's dry and firm in acidity, with complex flavors of cherries and raspberries, although to overemphasize the fruit gives the wrong impression. Also prominent are minerals, flowers and herbs.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
11424,Morris Ranch 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area. The climate shows in the brisk acidity, while the excellence of the vintage gives savory flavors of cherries, anise and cola. Oak adds a fine touch of toast. Drink now–2013.",42.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
11426,Calicaro 2008 Paris Mountain Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Direct and appealing now, like a cola drink infused with cherry and raspberry essence, with the caramelized, brown butter sauce complexities from oak barrel aging. That's pretty delicious, and the finish is dry and crisp, but this is not a wine to age.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
11430,Pear Valley 2012 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"Extremely ripe and fragrant aromas of strawberry preserves smell quite quaffable on this decently priced wine.

11437,Bouchaine 2012 Bacchus Collection Terraces Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Oaky and tannic at first sip, this wine has a softness waiting to let loose on the palate and reveal more floral cherry and raspberry notes.

11468,Rex Hill 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fruity and forward, this is a pretty, approachable wine with bright berry and cherry fruit. There's a strong note of citrus, particularly orange flesh and rind, and it's the sort of no-nonsense, gluggable wine that one rarely finds associated with Pinot Noir. This will be best enjoyed by 2018.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

11495,Lemelson 2006 Meyer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Meyer Vineyard, in the Red Hills of Dundee, ripened especially well in 2006, bringing forth concentrated fruits that mix raspberry, cranberry, pie cherry and finishing hints of rhubarb. Spice and sharp acids add definition to the midpalate, and the careful barrel aging has introduced accent notes of nutmeg, licorice and black tea. Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
11499,Le Cadeau 2006 Equinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Le Cadeau's Equinoxe Cuvée is the winery's most limited offering, just 110 cases.

11505,Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2005 Balistreri Family Vineyard Freestone View Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.",100.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
11531,Melville 2011 Block M Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows intensely concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, with an earthy note of sweet beetroot and a dusting of exotic crushed hard spices.

11543,Cinnabar 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A pretty Pinot, showing just the right balance of weight and fruit.

11561,Talbott 2014 Diamond T Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Hailing from a precipitously perched vineyard above Carmel Valley on the coastal end of the region, this bottling offers baked red cherries, beets, rhubarb pie, cinnamon spice and a touch of iron-rich soil on the nose.

Rita Hills),"Baked black plum, gingerbread, dried mint, clove-laden cherry pie and a touch of light licorice show on the nose of this rich style of Pinot from the Santa Ynez-based, family-owned winery. The palate starts with rich black-cherry fruit, but then dives into an intriguing wash of thyme, sagebrush and anise, finishing on dried cranberry and pomegranate.",55.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
11578,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The eponymous winemaker of this brand is based in San Francisco, from which, in this bottling, he turns out a stunner. Focused, intense, energetic and yet delicate, the nose is full of just-ripe raspberries, bay leaf, thyme, eucalyptus and chipped slate. A sip reveals crushed herbs galore, from oregano to anise, set against tart pomegranate and red plums. Menthol shows on the finish.",43.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413

11630,Russian Hill 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Smells thin and sweaty-funky, with little flavor, except the heat of alcohol. Maybe there's a drop of cherries.",28.0,81,1,0.9331578735408413
11639,Le Cadeau 2006 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle.

As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision.",47.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
11645,Torii Mor 2006 Olson Vineyard Old Vine Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Just 44 cases of this fragrant and elegant reserve were made from the estate vineyard's oldest vines; at 35 years of age they have the grace and sensuous elegance that only time can bring.

11646,Torii Mor 2006 Olson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The flavors are sappy and spicy and full, and the wine has a pleasing depth and richness. The fruits run through red and purple berries and lead into hints of chocolate and leaf. The winemaking is polished and confident, and yet Jacques Tardy has left just enough roughness in the flavors to give the wine personality and character. May be cellared for up to a decade.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
11648,Black Kite 2006 Kite's Rest Vineyard River Turn Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Give this crisp young wine some time in a decanter, and it gets better as it warms up in the glass, evolving from being tight, acidic and closed to offering exotic flavors of raspberry jam, tangerine zest and baked cherry pie, complete with the smoky-sweet crust.

11658,Franchere 2015 Havlin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is an herbal, low-alcohol style. Tart wild berry, lemony citrus, fresh herbs and a streak of iron combine gracefully.

11814,Orentano 2010 R. Buoncristiani Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Some unripe mushroom and leafy notes compromise this silky wine, along with richer flavors of cola. The alcohol is nice and moderate, but the cold vintage has taken its toll. Drink up.",38.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
11849,Patz & Hall 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows good Sonoma Coast character in the tart acids and cool-climate flavors of pomegranates, cherries and cola. Lots of new French oak adds rich notes of buttered toast and smoke. Appealingly dry, it's a fancy, elegant wine from this fine producer, but finishes a little short.

11901,Monte Ferro 2013 Dion Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is becoming a golden age for quality, value-oriented Oregon Pinot Noir. But within that broad category, there are very few single-vineyard, Willamette Valley entries. Add this to the list. All Pommard clone, 30% new French oak, and a pale, lovely shade of rose, this brings substantial berry, root beer, earth and iron flavors into play. Complex and refined, it has subtle power.",22.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
11906,Phillips Hill 2012 Valenti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This has a red-brick rim, and mellow aromas and soft texture seem to confirm this is a mature wine that's ready to enjoy.

11935,Loring Wine Company 2006 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Keefer has not been Loring's most successful bottling. The '06 is pleasant, and in its own way delicious, with upfront raspberry, cherry, cola and smoky vanilla flavors balanced with crisp acidity. But it has a candied one-dimensionality, and doesn't seem likely to age.",50.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
11947,St. Innocent 2014 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Zenith is the winery's estate vineyard, and represents a particularly fine value in a splendid lineup.

Rita Hills),"Winemaker Rachel Silkowski takes cues from her mentor Brian Loring in her debut wine, which is brawny and lavish with nose-ticklingly spicy aromas of cloves and nutmeg laid across black plum, olallieberry and violets.

12145,Buena Vista 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"An oaky, concentrated wine, this is briary in robust black and blue fruit that offers a smidgen of black tea. Tannic, this is a powerful wine from a powerful vintage, exuding much of the appellation's earthy signature.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

12194,Lachini 2014 Prima Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012. Production is up sharply, and it's a ripe, round fruit pie of a wine, best enjoyed while still young. Red fruits and citrus are in the mix, with a touch of papaya.

12218,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Outland Ridge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins.

Well done but not overdone.",35.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
12219,William Hatcher 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Hatcher delivers excellent value. Concentrated black cherry fruit runs on through a delicious, cherry cola finish. It's dusted with cinnamon and sassafras, and built for cellaring through 2024.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413

12581,Del Rio 2009 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"With alcohol at just 12.7%, this is one of several under-13% Pinots tasted recently that seem to be setting a new trend in Oregon.

12886,Kason 2014 Dijon 115 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this suffers from a sameness of flavors.

13013,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown and Bottled Pinot Noir (Alexander Valley),"On the thin side of light-bodied, this has an abundance of oak that overpowers the subtle fruit in this wine from an estate property in a relatively warm appellation.

13081,MacPhail 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Punchy, sizable tannins make this wine a beast at first. It's dry on the palate, yet sultry, well-defined layers of dark cherry and toasty vanilla-oak manage to persist around seasonings of minty dried herb and cinnamon.

13112,Bailiwick 2010 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"The vineyard is a fine one, the fruit source for highly regarded Pinots from Tandem and Bailiwick's own Silver Pines label.

13149,J. Christopher 2014 Dundee Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Ripe red fruits mingle gracefully, along with suggestions of toasted coconut, from aging in one-quarter new barrels.

13213,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Emerald Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Velvety and thick, this wine is tannic, oaky and still tenacious about its youth.

13387,Foursight 2014 Clone 05 Charles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Unconventional but outstanding, this wine is an earthy throwback to an earlier era, from its light, brownish color to its dried leaf, rhubarb and wet earth aromas to its lean but complex red cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors.

13412,Phillips Hill 2010 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic.

13525,Paraiso Vineyards 2006 West Terrace Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Best to give this young Pinot a year or two in the cellar, because it's a little too closed to completely enjoy now. It doesn't show the generosity of the '01 or '05, but is more tannic and a little earthier. Should mellow through 2009 and let the cherry flavors emerge.",40.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

13581,Kendall-Jackson 2010 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"A very nice Pinot Noir that's dry and silky, with satisfying cherry, cola, oak and spice flavors. Not one to age, but fine for drinking now, and easily as good as many Pinots costing more.",19.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
13589,Clos de la Tech 2010 Domaine Lois Louise Cote Sud Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Black-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by Silicon Valley veterans T.J. and Valeta Rodgers, but it is deftly hidden behind layers of earth and herbs, from dark clay and black pepper to budding violets and rosemary.

13746,Suncé Vineyard & Winery 2009 Winemaker's Reserve Zora's Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel.

13752,Siduri 2012 Hawk's View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further.",42.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
13777,Evening Land 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The most widely available bottling from Evening Land, this has a strong streak of earth and bark, with somewhat flat-tasting fruit flavors of black cherry cola.

13781,Carmel Road 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"There's a peppy ease to the aromas of this bottling, with light raspberry and rhubarb lifted by cola and sarsaparilla notes. The palate is a tad fruit-punchy, with red cherry and some thyme to give depth.",25.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413

13857,Gavilan 2013 Pinot Noir (Chalone),"The nose of this wine is quite shy at first, and it takes patience to pull out aromas of plum, crushed berries and a touch of charcoal.

14143,Chanin 2013 Duvarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Raspberry and cinnamon spice hit the nose first followed by crushed cloves on this supremely balanced wine by Gavin Chanin from a vineyard that's northwest of the Sta.

Once tasted it's a lush, forward, sweetly appealing wine with the impressive fruit concentration of the 2012 vintage, underscored with a layer of mineral.

14384,Chehalem 2013 RR Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"The RR wines receive special packaging, but little technical information is provided. Though this is a 2013, it's of a piece with the winery's 2014 Pinots, which is to say that lemony acids and a plethora of herbal components overshadow the fruit. There are hints of wild berry, and a finish with light suggestions of chocolate.",79.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

14434,Keller 2009 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The brisk acidity and tough tannins suggest cellaring this Pinot Noir for a while. To judge by the core of cherries and red currants, it should ride out the years effortlessly. Beyond the fruit is a fine, mushroomy earthiness and a feral quality sometimes found in better Sonoma Coast Pinots. Give it until 2017.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413

14563,Zilaro Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Temecula Valley),"It must be challenging to grow Pinot Noir in this warm region, but this bottling shows some promise.

14614,Penner-Ash 2014 Pas de Nom Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"From select barrels, this “no name” reserve takes the signature elements of the winery's Pinots—notably forward, plush berry fruits and a strong whiff of tobacco—and punches them up to the next level. Big, solid, almost chunky with packed flavor, it touches lightly on lifted aromatics, and frames its tannins in dark chocolate.",125.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
14617,Panther Creek 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Much riper than the previous vintage, this retains those complex aromatics, with cocoa powder, rose petals and chocolate highlights around ripe raspberry and cherry fruit. It is a graceful, precise and delicious wine, buttressed with fresh non-chalky acidity, baking spices and a hint of ginger. The long outstanding finish suggests tucking a few bottles away for enjoyment over the next decade.",45.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
14628,Clos du Val 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
14636,MacPhail 2006 Wightman House Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Here's a wine that straddles the border between ripeness and unripeness. Very dry and high in acids, its cherry and root beer flavors have an edge of lightly-sugared green mint tea. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it's a clean, interesting Pinot Noir to have with a good steak.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
14648,Foxen 2015 Block 43 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Very fresh although not particularly fruity aromas of raspberry mesh with allspice, thyme and tarragon on the nose of this block-designate bottling from the historic vineyard. Energetic and lighter red-fruit flavors like pomegranate show on the sip, where fennel is the dominant spice.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
14655,Bernardus 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.",55.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
14675,Bruliam 2012 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot is all about fruit, which is both its strength and its limitation. Raspberries, strawberries, persimmons are there, alongside caramelized, buttery oak. The finish is tannic and dry. Drink by 2016, after decanting.",46.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
14683,Wild Horse 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"For twenty bucks, you get a a cool-climate Pinot that's eminently drinkable. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and delicately structured, with cola, raspberry and persimmon flavors. It won't age, but is a fine example of Central Coast Pinot Noir. With production of 140,000 cases, it's easy to find.",20.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
14732,Courtney Benham 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"A good starter Pinot, if you're just learning about the variety. It's properly dry and silky, with red cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and spice flavors.",16.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
14733,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"Starts off a bit green and stemmy in aroma, and in the mouth, tannins overwhelm the cherry-berry fruit. Good and dry, but a bit underripe and simple. Drink now.",18.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
14736,Erath 2012 Oregon Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is a fine budget bottle, with an aromatic mix of tart berry and pine needle. A streak of chocolate surrounds a supple, smooth wine that carries its tangy fruit through a satisfying finish, with just a suggestion of tanned leather.",19.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
14742,Pennywise 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"Smoky and assertive in aroma, this is concentrated in flavor, with ripe black cherry, a touch of almost-sweet boysenberry and plenty of toasty, oaky shadings. Not sweet, but as rich and compelling as a blackberry tart.",12.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
14746,WildStock 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A new brand from Scott Paul, this relatively value-priced wine is tight and tart, with cranberry and black cherry fruit. The acidity juts out a bit, though that may improve with additional bottle age.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
14766,Michaud 2014 Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Pressed cranberry, underripe raspberry and white pepper form the alluring aromatic base for this bottling that dives into Kalamata olive and cardamom notes on the nose. There is great energy on the sip, with anise, buzzy Sichuan peppercorn and Indian spice enlivening the tomato leaf and cherry-tomato fruit.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14770,Morgan 2014 Double L Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The waves of aromas on this bottling are quite intriguing, starting with meat then moving to black olive and tobacco. It finally settles into dense rose petals, purple flowers, cinnamon, dark hibiscus and black plum. The sip focuses on minerality, with chipped slate showing first, then goes toward juniper and pine, all against a black raspberry and pomegranate backdrop.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14771,Navarro 2014 Deep End Blend Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Long a producer of high quality and good value, Navarro seems to be raising the bar higher on its Pinot Noir. A vivid, potent and concentrated fruit component lights up this full-bodied wine from the first whiff through the finish. Black cherry, violet and cassis come together in a powerful beam of flavor. A good backbone of acidity and firm tannins supports that power nicely.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14786,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Estate Vineyard Etzel Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way.",60.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
14800,Pacific Coast 2008 Babcock Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dry and brittle, with less than fully ripened cherry fruit. There's actually a vegetal edge, which makes the acids and tannins uncomfortably hard. A poor example of this celebrated vineyard.",40.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
14848,Reata 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This shows real Sonoma Coast character in its silky texture, strong acidity and transparency of its raspberry and cherry notes, which allow for a mineral-driven taste of the soil to shine. The wine improves in the glass as it airs, picking up extra layers of complexity.",30.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
14884,Pali 2013 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lavender, potpourri, cranberry-orange juice, Sichuan peppercorn, graphite and cinnamon hit the nose on this bottling from winemaker Aaron Walker. The complex, ever-evolving palate blends pomegranate and citrus rinds with black slate, peppercorns, dried oregano, thyme and rosemary.",58.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14891,Gary Farrell 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp undercurrents of tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry provide a brightness and light to this wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. An inaugural release for the producer from this vineyard, it bristles with cinnamon and clove, delving into black pepper spiciness as well. Drink this structured wine now through 2023.",70.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14892,Ghost Hill 2012 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Pinot Noir,"The color alone catches your attention; it's a deep, smoky sunset hue that leads into an equally captivating palate. Rich, warm and dense with cherry pastry flavors, it also brings accents of cherry tobacco, orange liqueur and a glassy minerality.",42.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14903,Hyde de Villaine 2012 Ysabel Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"From the 1,400-elevation Van der Kamp Vineyard, this wine conveys roses and black tea, along with a woodsy, truffle-like character. While powerfully round and soft, it offers elegance in abundance, alongside a swatch of fresh-dug earth and a thick finish of forest floor. Drink now through 2022.",116.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14907,Stemmler 2013 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Gorgeous fruit aromas and flavors fill out this plush-textured and softly balanced wine. It offers ripe black cherry and raspberry tones and a full body, but has a delightful, light touch on the palate. The finish lingers nicely, too.",44.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
14919,River's Edge 2013 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Elkton Oregon),"Quite a different style from last year's 15% alcohol version, this seems raw, slightly bitter, and hints at garlic in the nose. Black cherries, cola and earth are in the mix, but something is not quite settled.",24.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
14927,Andretti 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This dense, full-bodied wine exhibits characteristics of savory dried cranberry and pomegranate as well as an earthy sense of rose and herb. The contrast reaches its apex on the slightly sour finish.",45.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
14931,Spell 2013 Nichole's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Rich, thick and robust, this offers a mélange of black cherry and strawberry. A fruity element dominates over any savory varietal character.",39.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
14960,Big Table Farm 2015 Pelos Sandberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Crisply fruity, this shows some carbonic brightness, pushing cranberry and raspberry fruit ahead of lighter flavors of cherry Popsicle. It's a lightweight, yet delightful, summertime red.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14966,Chehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",70.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14968,Clos du Val 2015 Gran Val Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Made in a full-bodied and fleshy style, this comes from an estate vineyard long owned by the producer. Cloudy, with a distinct fresh cherry aroma, it opens with leathery tannins and pronounced oak notes before its bright, citrus-like acidity settles in.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14969,Coeur de Terre 2014 Tallulah's Run Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This opens with juicy cranberry and cherry fruit, remaining concentrated through the core palate. Good as it is, the wine fades more quickly than its reserve siblings, which would suggest drinking this one first while the others gain further time in bottle.",65.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14979,Etude 2016 Grace Benoist Ranch Estate Grown Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This creamy, lush wine expresses orange and tangerine fruit mostly, with slight cherry and strawberry accents. High-toned acidity lifts the riper, plush mouthfeel.",28.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14985,Iron Horse 2014 North Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"From a replanted block of the vineyard, this wine is zesty, savory and high in acidity. With a backbone of stony texture and a deep core of licorice and strawberry flavors, it's bold in tannins and intensity, yet finishes bright.",85.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14987,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration.",74.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
14999,Maison L'Envoyé 2012 Two Messengers Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A forward, softly fruity wine closer to California Pinot than most Oregon examples. The vintage contributes lush fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry, while aging in 20% new French oak brings a layer of smooth milk chocolate.",30.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15006,Cinnabar 2012 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Chewy tannins make this Pinot Noir feel hard in the mouth. On the plus side is a dense core of raspberries and cherries, as well as a rich appliqué of smoky oak. Try aging it until 2017 to let it mellow.",44.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15022,Ravines 2009 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Whispers of charred wood, ripe bramble and earth add an elegant rusticity to this Pinot Noir's subtle black-cherry flavor. This is delicately structured, with bright, brisk acidity and a hint of dried mushroom that linger on the palate.",23.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
15050,Hartford 1999 Dutton Ranch-Sanchietti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Pure, seductive Pinot aromas combine floral, rose-petal aromas with dark fruit and brown sugar. Rich flavors of blackberries and boysenberries cascade across the palate in a fall of velvet. Moderate acidity makes it approachable now, but there's enough tannin to preserve it for a few years. A wine that can stand up to steak but still retains a sense of Pinot elegance. Editors' Choice.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
15052,Dutton-Goldfield 1999 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Fabulous, fun wine. The aromas are beautiful: cola, black raspberry, dark tea, vanilla, smoke and dusty spices. On the palate, it's limpid, delicate. It seems to float, yet there's powerful fruit. Wonderful now and through 2003.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
15054,Sebastopol 1999 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Combines a delicate body with punchy flavors to create a feminine wine of considerable power and finesse. It avoids jamminess, coming down on the side of less ripe earth and tomato, although there are gorgeous stone fruit notes and a sumptuous overlay of smoky oak. The flavors and texture are absolutely terrific.",30.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
15059,Au Bon Climat 1999 Knox Alexander Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A gorgeously plush Pinot, redolent of bright cherry, strawberry, plum, cinnamon and herbs. Explosively fragrant, it's rich and lively on the palate, where it finishes long and lush. A real winner from this Central Coast specialist in Pinot Noir.",45.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
15062,Hartford 1999 Arrendell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Aromas of dark fruit, anise, smoke and dried herbs morph into flavors of stone fruits (plums, cherries) in the mouth, with a strong undercurrent of pomegranate. This thick, almost syrupy wine is almost steroidally concentrated, but stays focused thanks to lemony acids that might be too much for some tasters.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15080,Angeline 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"A little one-dimensional, but pleasant enough, with silky flavors of cola, licorice, cherries and smoky oak. This is one of the better Pinot Noirs in this price range.",14.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
15108,Cru 2012 Vineyard Montage Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Pretty and polished, this Pinot is delicately structured, with a great burst of acidity and a dry, spicy finish. The raspberry, vanilla and toast flavors are a little thin, but pleasant and complex. It's ready to drink now.",24.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
15113,Bernardus 2012 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The texture is off, resulting in a rustic feeling, despite lush flavors of raspberries, figs and sweet, toasty oak. Mainly the problems are jarring tannins plus alcoholic heat on the finish.",70.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
15127,La Montagne 2011 Huber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This single-vineyard Pinot is a bit tough. The main issue is the tannins, which are edgy. It's ripe in raspberries, pomegranates and cola, with good acidity and a jacket of oak. Drink up.",55.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
15133,Bernardus 2012 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Despite ripe cherry, red licorice and cola flavors, this Pinot feels heavy and tannic in the mouth. It lacks the delicacy you want in the variety. It will age for many years, never quite shedding its rusticity.",55.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
15148,Wrath 2008 San Saba Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey),"The vineyard bears only a Monterey appellation, but the location is strategically close to both the Santa Lucia Highlands and the Arroyo Seco. The wine is quite good, racy in acidity and dry. It offers complex flavors of strawberries and cherries, with earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and mulch. A real success, and a wine that will pick up bottle complexity over the next 4–5 years.",49.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15153,Sequana 2008 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"You'll find an unusual note of freshly crushed black pepper in this Pinot Noir. Not overwhelming, but enough to vie with the cherries, cola and sandalwood. It's an excellent wine, dry and silky, although not on a par with the magnificent 2007.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15154,Ellman Family 2008 Alexis Skye Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tremendously complex, offering ever-changing elements for the palate to discover. Cherries, raspberries, dusty spices, gingerbread, bacon fat, sweet vanilla, toast, they all flood together. Delicious, but seems a little soft, possibly lacking the structure to age.",49.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15188,Stephen & Walker 2006 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"There's a depth of Burgundian flavor, a forest floor and mulch note in this rich, earthy Pinot Noir. It explodes with red and black cherry, licorice, tangerine zest and cola flavors, with a superb tannin structure. Beautiful now, and should develop for up to eight years.",39.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15194,Gary Farrell 2006 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Great structure marks this lush, young Pinot Noir. Crisp acidity and refined, firm tannins give it a solid framework, and the flavors are delicious. Shows pie-filling cherries, black raspberries, currants and mocha, with spicy cinnamon and anise. Will age for up to a decade.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15201,Erath 2006 Bishop Creek Pinot Noir,"The first Bishop Creek designation from Erath, this dark-toned, deep and concentrated Pinot Noir is one to cellar. The fruit is seamless, sappy and dense, suggesting a mix of ripe berries. Fourteen months in French oak, about 40% new, seems just right, as the barrel notes of toast and coffee dance around the juicy berry flavors without smothering them.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15228,Anthony Nappa 2015 Anomaly Pinot Noir (New York),"Sweet scents of sun-kissed watermelon and raspberry perfume this irresistibly zingy wine. The bright berry palate is deeply concentrated, but also shaded by tones of bramble and mineral that lend depth and substance. It's satisfyingly full in body with a thirst-quenching finish.",20.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15239,Bouchaine 2013 Bacchus Collection Terraces Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a dry, tannic estate wine that's rich and ripe with a leathery aspect of gun smoke and blackberry. It shows more in the way of black fruit and spicy pepper than fruit that's delicate or crisp.",60.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
15240,Byington 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Dark pink in the glass, this bubbly is incredibly foamy throughout the experience. It begins with aromas of strawberry, raspberry, plum and red apple, then explodes with bubbles on the palate, which make it hard to find the sour pomegranate and plum-skin flavors that eventually emerge.",39.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
15259,St. Innocent 2013 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lushly scented with fresh-cut wood, red berries, cherries and toasted coconut, this delicately entwines the flavors that follow. It's a gentle, lovely, graceful and low-alcohol beauty that should continue to drink well into the mid-2020's.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15286,Joseph Jewell 2012 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Spicy, fruity and fresh, this hearty vineyard-designate is high-toned in red cherry and citrus, well-integrated and softly layered, with a blistering note of tannic power on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",48.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15299,J. Rochioli 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is direct and candied, with cherry and raspberry jam and and sweet oak flavors, but brightened with crisp acidity. A very good Pinot, but pricey for the quality. Keep in mind that this is not one of Rochioli's vineyard-designated bottlings.",79.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
15341,Signaterra Benziger 2012 La Reyna Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From one of the Benziger family's coolest-climate vineyards, and one that is Demeter-certified Biodynamic, there's a richness of cherry amid subtle aromatics of rose and cinnamon spice. A delicate wine that's light in texture, it offers earthiness and a long, balanced finish.",49.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15403,Et Fille 2012 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Despite the famed vineyard on the label, this seems a bit gauzy, chalky and stripped. There are light suggestions of berry and cherry, and hints of the nice details of earth and mineral that old vines can often bring. The finish is dilute and slightly metallic.",48.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
15427,Hawks View 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Medium weight, round and tangy, this shows a core of cranberry/cherry fruit, a whiff of cola and a suggestion of the tack room. It's a detailed and somewhat earthy Pinot Noir. From the estate vineyard, it's what you hope to find in Oregon— Pinot that is artisanal, a little quirky, distinctive and above all, enjoyable. Fades just a bit too quickly.",35.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15430,William Hatcher 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A little extra bottle age has helped this wine soften up, but it still seems to stop a bit short. The entry is firm and shows some Oregon herbal character, along with tart, wild berry and light baking spices. There is a vague hint of barnyard as well. The tannins are beginning to smooth out, and this can probably benefit from a few more years in the cellar.",48.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15432,I'M 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",35.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15434,La Fenêtre 2008 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two.",39.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15437,Arista 2008 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A challenging wine. It's rather strong and dry and extracted now, lacking delicacy, and makes you want to stick it in the cellar for a while. Yet there's a certain hollowness that may limit ageability. If you drink it now, give it a good decant.",54.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
15485,Boedecker Cellars 2011 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The wine features very pretty aromatics and a soft and elegant entry that is just on the edge of high-toned.

15497,Matrix 2013 R. Buoncristiani Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"High-toned red fruit wraps around jolts of black tea in this savory, structured and nicely made vineyard-designate, a full-bodied, burly wine. Drinking well upon opening, it develops nuance and character in the glass as it goes along.",52.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15502,Ousterhout 2013 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a light, clear and moderately oaked vineyard-designate from a tremendous Westside Road site. Pomegranate, rhubarb and cherry-orange play on the palate in lithe, ethereal and elegant ways, remaining light bodied and refined throughout.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15508,Spindrift Cellars 2013 Bovine Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),The fragrant mix of flowers and fruit introduces a wine already moving into secondary fruit flavors. Strawberry and cherry components are softened with highlights of cola and caramel. There's a hint of orange creeping into the hue around the rim. Drink now through 2018.,28.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15514,Loring Wine Company 2014 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"From a vineyard in Nipomo at the southern end of the county, this fresh bottling show strawberries, ripe lavender, exotic rose petals, cinnamon and lots of red-spice notes. The palate is peppy, with tangy cranberry and pomegranate fruit as well as deeper notes of sandalwood, flint and gravel.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
15522,Animale 2014 Pinot Noir,"Listed as well in excess of 15% alcohol, this is sourced from a single vineyard in a hot year. The grapes were left to hang while sugars rose precipitously. Flavors suggest mincemeat pie, brown sugar and root beer. Not typical, but tasty enough. Drink over the next year for peak flavor.",28.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
15546,Henry Estate 2015 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is an elegant edition of the Henry Estate Pinot Noir. It has shed its rusticity in favor of a delicate expression of varietal character.

15594,Roar 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Delicious in raspberries, cherries, sassafras, cola, orange blossom tea and vanilla, with a beautifully silky texture, this single-vineyard Pinot comes from low-yielding vines in the central part of the appellation. It's a little too soft for cellaring, but offers solid pleasure now.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
15605,Inman Family 2007 Thorn Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a very good wine in here, with bright acidity, smooth tannins and complex flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola. Yet there's also a strange metallic taste that makes you wonder about the screwcap. It could just be the high acidity combined with minerality. Give it a good long decant before drinking.",56.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

15739,SeaGlass 2015 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"One of the more reliable grocery store brands on the market right now, this bottling shows aromas of hot cherry pie with a vanilla and nutmeg crust.

15752,Citation 2002 Citation Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Released in the autumn of 2011 at nine years of age, the 2002 Citation, not surprisingly, has dried out. Fruit leather and earthy tannins are lightly streaked with citrus. Drink up.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

15776,J. Christopher 2012 Dundee Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from several different Dundee Hills vineyards, this wraps its black cherry fruit in tart acids, chalky minerals, and a hint of iron.

It's already a sturdy, expressive, impressive wine with deep flavors of fruit, earth and rock.",39.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15778,Martinelli 2012 Three Sisters Vineyard Sea Ridge Meadow Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A light, clear color suggests a lighthearted wine, but this coastal vineyard-designate delivers plenty of power around a core of damp, earthy wild strawberry and blackberry. Soft, with managed and integrated tannins, it's relatively high in acidity and is well structured, with a pleasant jamminess and aromas of freshly cut rose.",63.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

15854,Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Bliss Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Shows the gorgeousness of fruit this vineyard always delivers, as well as the seemingly impossible balancing act of feminine generosity and structural power. The result will be evident to anyone who loves Pinot Noir. This is a massive wine, ripe with red fruits and berries and mocha, but it's also worthy of aging. Give it at least six years.",70.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
15855,Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Lynn's Blend Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome wine that shows the power of the estate vineyard, yet with a deft, elegant touch.

15880,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Pinot Noir,"In a three-pack of 2014 Pinots from Saffron Fields, this shows reserve-level density and extra complexity.

The texture is firm due to good acidity and lightly gripping tannins, but the rich flavors soak through them for a lingering finish. It will be best after 2020.",52.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
15892,Lioco 2014 La Selva Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Generous and mouthfilling, this is a medium- to full-bodied wine with fruity aromas.

15924,Methven Family Vineyards 2005 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb.",25.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413

16020,Fulcrum 2008 Hein Vineyard - Hayley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Shows the challenges of the 2008 vintage, which was alternately cool, hot and rainy in the North Coast.

16072,Fess Parker 2014 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Winemaker Blair Fox loves this single-clone bottling, and for good reason.

16086,Trisaetum 2015 Ribbon Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged.

It's balanced, dry and rich in cherry and raspberry-pie flavors, with an opulent overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Drink now–2015.",34.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16513,Point & Line 2015 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Concentrated aromas of violets and rose buds meet with black raspberry on the nose of this bottling. Quite light in the glass, it's full of tart red-fruit flavors, from cranberry to red-plum skins, with herbal tones on the midpalate: oregano, marjoram and dried lavender. The finish is grippy and driven by menthol.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16544,Patz & Hall 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of raspberry and cherry fruit and sweet, caramelized oak in this Pinot Noir. It's rather simple, but crisp in acidity. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",42.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
16571,Waits-Mast 2009 Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A classic coastal California Pinot, dry, silky and complex.

16704,Tandem 2007 Auction Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Absolutely delicious now, this barrel selection of Tandem's different vineyard designates dazzles with flashy flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, cola, persimmon, pomegranate and cinnamon-pepper, elaborated with the bubbling brown sugar accents of oak.

16705,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Windy Hill Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Shows the full-bodied richness and fruity concentration of all Fogarty's Pinots.

16714,Chanin 2007 Le Bon Climat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16717,MacMurray Ranch 2007 Winemaker's Block Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Easily the best MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ever.

16762,Terra Valentine 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Strawberry and a rich streak of raspberry liqueur play nice in this fresh, zesty Pinot. Tight with tension on the palate, it also features layers of earthy forest-floor mushroom. Big in style, it comes together nicely and makes for an enjoyable wine.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16824,Ponzi 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tons of raspberry, vanilla and licorice, backed by spice, coffee and all sorts of size and depth. The complexity is excellent, but so is the straightforward attitude it shows. Given time, it unfolds in layer upon layer of excitement. A gem of an appellation wine; it makes you wonder just how good the Ponzi Reserve will be.",25.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16825,Torii Mor 1998 Eason Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Intense and earthy aromas of perfectly ripe berries, chocolate and a little natural funk in the form of mushroom. The highlight of this beauty is the cushy, plummy mouth, which is complex, cool and ultimately sublime. A real playboy of a Pinot, which opens up sensationally if given an hour's breathing. Only 116 cases made.",35.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16826,Panther Creek 1998 Bednarik Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Wild roses and forest undergrowth wrap their persistent tendrils around ripe cherries and just a hint of toast on the nose of this complex and seductive offering. Finishes with enough structure to suggest trying again in a couple of years, once the midpalate has filled out.",48.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16829,Cristom 1998 Marjorie Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Earth and cola notes accent a true Burgundian nose of rustic raspberry and herbs. This is a stylish, reserved wine—one that sits nicely on the palate and glides down smooth while still holding its cards tight to the vest. It should blossom and soften in about three or four years; now it has everything going for it.",39.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16830,Argyle 1998 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This one is all about the seductive and sexy side of Pinot. The ample bouquet is pure elegance, with an atypically rich cherry and chocolate character. The luscious mouthfeel supports the plummy flavor, which is accented by clove, lavender and anise.

16831,La Bete 1998 Knight's Gambit Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Multi-dimensional and inviting, the nose offers a melange of cherry, spice, earth and gamy notes. A very supple mouthfeel follows with wonderfully firm, but not biting, acidity. Dark cherry and oak flavors hang on a handsome frame.

Has great character; a most impressive example of the vintage and the Knight’s Gambit and Red Hills Estate Vineyards.",40.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
16834,Adelsheim 1998 AVS Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aromas and flavors of dark cherry, earth, and leather; lots of toast, too.

Supple and sophisticated Oregon Pinot Noir.",40.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16837,Siduri 1998 Archery Summit Vineyard Pinot Noir (California),"An atypically oaky wine for Siduri, with a rich veneer of French oak overlying black cherries, cola and spice. The intensity builds on the palate, where root beer and black cherries culminate in a long, smoky-spicy finish. Needs a couple of years to pull itself together, but the raw materials are all there.",49.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16838,Domaine Drouhin 1998 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Commanding nose, with cherry, purple basil, mineral and meaty elements. Fine depth of fruit, with sweet-tart and earthy notes, and a brisk mouthfeel. The tangy finish with its tart cherry, mineral and earth complexity holds you a long time. Serious, and fulfills Domaine Drouhin Oregon's promise to make great Pinot Noir on a par with Burgundy.",38.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16839,Panther Creek 1998 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tree bark and pine needles mark the aromas, adding woodsy complexity and weight to ripe black cherries.

16843,Chehalem 1998 3 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Earthy and engaging, and a little bit rugged.

Light oak shows itself early in a finish that unfolds in layers, revealing complexity and class.",25.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
16844,Elk Cove 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Very youthful, so the first aromas are of a wild field, with some cranberry. It’s a full-volume wine, with an appealing chunky forwardness but also bright acidity, style and character. In a word, it’s “balanced.” Will go with almost anything, from baked salmon to dark chocolate. A real pleaser, especially at this price point. Best Buy.",18.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
16856,Erath 2009 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Cherry flavors turn a bit syrupy, with a sour cherry candy appeal. Acidic and slightly volatile, this tight, chewy wine spent 14 months in 40% new French oak barrels.",34.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
16859,Firesteed 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though two years older than the widely available Oregon bottling from Firesteed, this wine is almost its twin. Elegant and balanced, with light flavors of wild berry and an herbal underpinning.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

16870,Victor Vineyards 2011 Pinot Noir (California),"Full bodied but smooth textured, this is ripe and enticing.

16877,Heron 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Globe-trotting Laely Heron's take on roughly 16-year-old vines in Monterey reveals aromas of Coca Cola, black cherry, ripe plum, sweet beet juice and a bit of tree bark. The palate is powered by anise-spiced cherries and pomegranate, fairly straightforward but quite quaffable.",19.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
16904,Kessler-Haak 2010 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Give this dry, elegant Pinot a couple of years to let all the parts knit together. Right now, the oak stands out, and the acidity seems out of balance with the rich raspberry and persimmon fruit. It's a remarkably complex wine, however, and should be even better by 2016.",42.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
16914,Pence Ranch 2010 Westslope Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This is sourced from the winery's steepest and most wind-exposed blocks in their estate vineyard. The wine is dry and fairly tannic, with a rich concentration of raspberries, currants and mushrooms.

16963,Bergström 2010 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Delicate and detailed, this balanced Pinot Noir displays a perfect mix of wild berry, mushroom, green tea and a whiff of compost. These threads of flavor, and others associated with them, create a delightful tapestry that continues through the lengthy finish.",65.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
16966,Rex Hill 2010 Old School Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This new designation from Rex Hill is a bit reticent aromatically, but full on the palate, with plummy fruit and a light hint of barnyard.

16971,Castle 2005 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A lovely young Pinot, filled with fresh fruits and spices, wrapped into a fine, silky texture.

17021,Siduri 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Deep and hearty aromas of blackberry, candied violet and dried lavender are enhanced by a touch of roasted pork on the nose of this red by Adam Lee.

17023,Bernardus 2015 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This bottling from the famously rich wine-making vineyard shows incredible restraint on the nose, starting with the reserved aromas of lavender, white pepper, bergamot, pomegranate and snappy raspberry.

17027,Navarro 2015 Methode A L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This suave and sophisticated wine is so smooth to sip that its depth of flavor is a little deceptive. A subtle potpourri of clove, cinnamon, black tea and blackberry aromas swirl around a great core of mild acidity, fine-grained tannins and many layers of concentrated fruit flavor. The texture is velvety and the finish lingers for at least 30 seconds.",32.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413

17068,Saracina 2011 Klindt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is an elegant Pinot Noir, aromatic in cherry and raspberry with juicy acidity and a memorable finish, understated in alcohol and too-ripe flavors.

17092,Soléna 2015 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"This vineyard, and the AVA it occupies, is often characterized by some sharp metallic mineral-driven flavors. Here it seems just marginally ripe, with beet, black tea and metal dominating the astringent finish.",55.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
17098,Lander-Jenkins 2013 Pinot Noir (California),"Ripe, almost-sweet fruit flavors dominate this full-bodied, soft-textured wine. It's a richer, oakier style of Pinot than most but will make a lot of people happy with its easy-going, welcoming personality.",18.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
17109,Brooks 2014 Big Cheese Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake. The fruit leans toward raisins and figs—just on the edge of overripe—and continues into a finish with vanilla wafer and macaroons. There's a lot going on, but it has not (yet) knit together.",48.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
17134,Gary Farrell 2012 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley.

17149,Siduri 2012 Lingenfelder Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's an intensity of cola-cinnamon spice and clove within the aromas and flavors of this single-vineyard designate, intriguing invites to explore further.

17161,Vision Cellars 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
17196,Domaine Alfred 2006 Chamisal Vineyards Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Bone dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, this Pinot has cherry and rhubarb flavors with an edge of fresh green herbs and peppercorns.

17197,Baker Lane 2006 Hurst Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The vineyard is in Sebastopol, and the wine shows its cool origins in brisk acidity, a soft, delicate structure, and a peppermint and clove edge to the cherry fruit flavors.

17198,Belle Glos 2006 Clark & Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"The vineyard is in Santa Maria Valley and the wine's success is dependent on vintage conditions, just like in Burgundy. Past releases have varied widely. The '06 is right in the middle, a dry, silky wine with cherry, cola, crushed brown spice and anise flavors, but also with a heavy tug of baked fruit.",50.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413

17246,Rooster Hill 2014 Barrel Reserve Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Subtle whiffs of rose petal, spice and earth entice on the nose of this rustic but pretty Pinot Noir. Lush in body, the palate suggests ruddy plum and cherry flavors shaded in tones of leather, smoked meat and balsamic. Finely grained tannins frame a long finish.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
17271,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2010 Laurène Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This reserve-level Pinot from DDO is exceptional in every way. Silky, elegant and deeply-fruited, it marries a plush midpalate of red berries and cherries to compelling grace notes of pine needle, cola and mocha. Delicious and ageworthy; if past vintages are any indication, this can go until 2029.",65.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
17276,Ken Wright 2012 Canary Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The 30-year-old vines at Canary Hill seem to have ripened well at lower brix, yielding a full-flavored, forward wine with lovely plum and cherry fruit.

17277,Ken Wright 2012 Carter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"A spine of steel runs through the core of this wine, supporting spicy fruit flavors of cranberry, pomegranate and raspberry. Details of black tea contribute to the length, while the balanced tannins and underlying minerality give it still more structural support.",65.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
17280,Sokol Blosser 2010 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This single block selection is a truly pretty wine, with scents and flavors of rose petals, raspberries, brown spices, nutmeg and mocha. It's complex and elegant, with a mouth-pleasing creaminess.",80.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413

17289,St. Rose 2011 Nunes Vineyard 777 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in color, this delicate wine is herbal and yet bright in Bing cherry, quite nuanced and slight at first, unveiling its concentration and complexity slowly and seductively over time. Made by longtime grape growers, the acidity is lively and the weight slim, traces of restrained oak and garden herb dancing in the background. Only 54 cases made.",44.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
17294,Ken Wright 2012 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Many wineries source fruit from this exceptional vineyard, but few make a better wine than this. Fragrant, elegant and smooth, it's tight and detailed, with a toasty edge to pretty cherry fruit. It flows gracefully into a finish laden with milk chocolate highlights and a streak of cola.",65.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
17297,Scott Paul 2011 Audrey Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Essentially Scott Paul's reserve, this is sourced entirely from biodynamically-farmed, 40-year-old vines at the Maresh vineyard. The Audrey layers cherry fruit with streaks of mineral, and carries plenty of underlying acidity. The wine manages to feel full-bodied without losing a sense of elegant proportion.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
17307,Domaine Anderson 2013 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This wine offers very ripe and vivid fruit in the aromas and the flavors, like blackberries and dark plums picked when they're just beginning to shrivel. The texture is broad and the body full, but the tannins and acidity feel low, so the wine's personality is both big and soft.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
17361,Witching Stick 2012 Dowser's Cuvee Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Nicely balanced and smooth, this starts with red cherry and raspberry aromas with hints of spice.

17390,Furthermore 2010 Bohemian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a nice, lightly silky texture to this Pinot Noir. It's rich in raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors that finish dry, with a touch of sweet oak. More problematic is the acidity. It doesn't feel natural, and sticks out, the way acidity does in Riesling. Drink up.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
17393,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
17481,Frank Family 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Offering a strong opening aroma of pine resin, this wine feels crisp and crunchy on the palate, with cranberry, pomegranate and red cherry flavors.

17494,Lula 2013 Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Mellow, suave, complex and layered, this wine blends oaky spice flavors with delicious ripe fruit in a harmonious texture. It's medium-bodied, showing generous oak influence and a mouthfeel marked by firm tannins and acidity.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17495,Marshall Davis 2014 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Single (777) clone, half new French oak, packed with flavor—this is ready to go. Concentrated flavors of black cherry, cola and vanilla, adorned even further with dusty sweet spices, make this a grab-and-go kind of wine. There's a lightly funky umami character to the finish, along with more barrel notes of coffee and caramel.",36.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17504,Rocky Point 2012 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Released three years ago, this is drinking at or near its peak. The fruit remains lush, with herbal threads tied throughout, and a pleasing scent and streak of tobacco. Black-cherry flavors push into velvety tannins, with a finishing touch of licorice.",65.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17505,Siduri 2014 Betty Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Dusty plum flavors meet baked bread aromas in this tightly-wound, tense vineyard-designated wine. It's marked by an undercurrent of pomegranate and rhubarb, the texture taking on more savory tones of forest and black tea as it finishes.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17506,Siduri 2014 Ewald Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A waft of freshly baked baguette unfurls on the nose of this wine, followed by sautéed mushroom scents, giving it earthy character. Soft and round on the palate, the fruit tends toward darker, lusher notes of blueberry and plum.",49.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17508,Territorial 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Here is a well-priced example of the outstanding 2014 Oregon Pinots. Black cherry and pomegranate fruits make for a juicy fresh fruit-driven palate. There's a touch of cola and caffè latte as well. It's seen 20% new French oak, to good effect.",26.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17518,Congress Springs 2006 Pinot Noir (California),"Thin, dry and harsh, with cola flavors that are so thin, all you can really detect is the heat of alcohol. If you're not fussy, it's a basic introduction to Pinot Noir.",13.0,80,1,0.9331578735408413
17544,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2008 Elton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Eola-Amity Hills has a distinctive “voice” in the newly-defined Willamette Valley AVAs. It brings in earth and herb in a round and integrated style, not abrasive or stemmy, but adding Burgundy-like notes to the essential Pinot Noir character. The fruit is light and mixes cherry and citrus, and the tannins are proportionate and supple.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
17549,Roar 2010 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Would have benefited from being held back a year or so longer before release, but you can compensate by cellaring it. Dry, very full-bodied for a Pinot Noir and rich in tannins, it shows robust blackberry and black cherry flavors. Should mellow and improve after 2015 or so.",52.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17569,Calera 2009 de Villiers Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Shows much in common with past vintages of this bottling. It's dry, tart in acidity and somewhat earthy, with a nice balance of cherries, herbs and cedar. Feels complex and distinguished, in a dry, elegant style.",35.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

17574,Ken Wright 2010 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"The Shea is a bit of an anomaly at 13.7% in a vintage where the other Ken Wright Pinots float around the 12–12.5% mark. Not surprisingly, the fruit is thicker and the midpalate more full and broad, with pleasing cherry-berry flavors framed in chocolaty oak. Though not as aromatically complex as its companions, it offers plenty of rich fruit flavor.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17588,San Simeon 2006 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"A little awkward. The wine shows a nice silkiness and crisp acidity. But the flavors have a cooked taste, with stewed blackberries and cola, in addition to caramelly oak.",24.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
17626,Calera 2004 Reed Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mount Harlan),"Shows the earthiness that often marks young Calera Pinot, which makes it less flashy but more elegant and food-friendly than many more expensive wines. The herb-infused cherry, raspberry and cola flavors are ripe and succulent, but acidity is a little deficient, so this may not be the most ageable wine.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
17646,Prodigal 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of clones 115, 667 and 777 shows deep pomegranate, dried violets, roiboos tea, baked plum and sarsaparilla notes on the nose. Cooked plum fruit also shows on the sip, which is dusted with clove, nutmeg, dried roses and earthy tannins. This plush wine is a mouthful.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
17651,Lucie 2014 Bacigalupi Vinyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft, juicy acidity and texture buoy this wine in wonderful ways, providing a lithe foundation to punches of sassafras and truffled earth.

17656,Winderlea 2014 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Here is a bold, striking wine from the estate vineyard. Black cherries capture the core flavor of the Dundee Hills AVA, with substantial, somewhat grainy tannins. Highlights of coffee grounds add another dark note. Pair this with a thick, wild-caught salmon steak.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
17667,Lutum 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a hearty version of the variety for this producer, known for its oft-lighter approach. It reveals skill as well, the grapes from another prime site overseen by brand partner Bill Price. A feral shock of mushroom dominates on the nose before punchy tannins and a medium-body distract slightly in contoured texture, only barely letting in crisp flavors of orange peel and dark cherry.",60.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413

17697,Solminer 2015 Duvarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This bottling from a vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills by David and Anna deLaski explores the lower ripeness, exotically spiced range of Pinot Noir. Aromas of tart boysenberry, sour hibiscus, sumac and white pepper show on the nose. The palate picks up a bit more viscosity to deliver cranberry, Kalamata olive and cardamom flavors.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17699,Starmont 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This well-made, well-priced wine over-delivers in terms of quality. Smoky cherry and plum accentuate the toasted oak, as a sturdy foundation of tannin gives it power and strength. The savory finish mixes forest and tea.",27.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
17717,Bruliam 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Dark reddish-orange in color, this medium-bodied rosé offers refreshing acidity against a dramatic backdrop of intensely etched flavors, a mix of dark cherry, strawberry and blood orange that refreshes and rewards.",20.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

17756,Oregon Trails 2015 OTWC Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This young release carries strong scents and flavors of cranberry, along with the sharp acidic attack that implies, which qualifies it as a good choice for many fatty dishes.

17807,Belle Glos 2006 Taylor Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A bit hot and heavy, lacking the freshness you want in a new-release Pinot Noir. The flavors are of cherries and blackberries baked into a pie that got a little overcooked.",60.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
17876,Lost Canyon 2006 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery's Saralee's bottling has been variable over the years. The '06 is tasty and eminently drinkable if you want a nice, dry, crisp Pinot. It's pale in color, silky in the mouth, and direct in cherry, cola, spice and oaky flavors.

17889,Duck Pond 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tart and forward, with cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center, this is a tasty, acidic and lightly spicy effort that shows some nice precision.

17912,Soléna 2013 Zena Crown Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This new vintage of the Zena Crown seems already faded. Light, tart strawberry fruit lacks concentration and carries a bit of bitter herb flavor. Tannins are earthy and the finish abrupt.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
17921,Ghost Pines 2013 Winemaker's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County),"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County.

17928,Ghost Hill 2014 Prospector's Reserve Pinot Noir,"Sourced from the estate's Bayliss-Bower vineyard, this reserve is a barrel selection that saw a touch more new oak (17%) than the regular bottling.

17951,Hirsch 2014 San Andreas Fault Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A toasty wood-smoke aroma meets firm, vivid and rather tart fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, elegant and cerebral wine.

17964,Baxter 2009 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"There's lots of forward raspberry, cherry and pomegranate fruit in this soft, lush wine. Oak brings an additional layer of richness. It's delicious—like toast spread with butter and jam—but a little one-dimensional. However, it's a wonderful dimension to explore now.",35.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
17965,Baxter 2009 Run Dog Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This shows both the finesse of the Anderson Valley and the '09 vintage that was so kind to coastal Pinot Noir.

18075,Sedition 2013 Chenoweth Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A new effort from Jigar Vineyards, sourcing some very good grapes, Sedition is light, clear and lingering on the palate in cherry-cola, mint and dried herb.

18129,Manzoni 2013 Home Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's a touch on barnyard on the nose of this bottling by one of the region's earlier settlers, with aromas of hay and oyster mushrooms adding intrigue to the cranberry fruit.

18181,Left Coast Cellars 2014 Truffle Hill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Bright raspberry fruit dominates here, backed with ample acidity. Give it a little breathing time and it fleshes out and lengthens. At this stage the fruit is clean and primary, but the overall structure suggests giving it another couple of years of bottle age for prime time enjoyment.",42.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
18193,Silver Mountain 2013 Tondre's Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation.

That's just what you get in this bottling from Siduri. The chilly vintage has made it lighter and lower in alcohol than the rich 2007, but it's more elegance and complex. This is a very interesting wine, one to linger over as it breathes in the glass.",48.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18376,Merry Edwards 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious.

18506,Talisman 2012 Badger Block Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A tiny-production wine from a windblown ridge in the Petaluma Gap, Badger Block is earthy and piquant in wild strawberry. Spicy and soft, it's almost velvety on the palate. Persistent in depth and length, the body is generous but balanced, spiked with the scent of fresh-picked rose petals.",75.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18507,Talley 2013 Stone Corral Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Light notes of pomegranate and hibiscus intertwine with Earl Grey tea and lavender on the nose of this wine from one of the region's most famous producers.

18520,Red Car 2012 Doc's Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry.

18534,Navarro 2009 Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"A fine young Pinot Noir, bristling with clean acidity and bone dry. It's strongly flavored, giving a burst of cherries, raspberries, cola and spices.",19.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18540,Bridlewood 2015 Pinot Noir (California),"Black pepper and rosemary aromas join forces with black cherry and blackberry flavors in this well-balanced, moderately tannic wine.

18547,Cummins Road 2013 Pinot Noir,"Strawberry fruit, framed in orange peel, characterizes this simple, yet enjoyable wine, from first sip to the last. It's forward and fruity, with a short tail.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18561,Joyful Noise 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This sends up scents of grape jam, plum and cherry, and those round and forward fruit flavors combine in the mouth. It's a tasty young wine, with plenty of immediate appeal from its lollipop-rainbow flavors.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18577,Donovan-Parke 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"Heavy and inert, with simple cherry Lifesaver candy and spice flavors and an aggressive texture. But it is dry.",15.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
18586,Heron Hill 2010 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Fragrant, with notes of ripe cherry and strawberry, this brisk, bright Pinot Noir is delicately framed, but juicy with nervy sour-cherry and cranberry flavors. Drying tannins make this an elegant food wine to pair with even robust poultry or pork dishes.",15.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
18588,Kastania 2010 Jaden & Keira's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This dry Pinot has a lovely, silky mouthfeel and ripe flavors of strawberries and oak. Tough tannins, marked acids and some green flavors distract.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
18598,Calera 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This Pinot is dry in style and tart with acidity, along with flavors of cranberries, cherries, sweet tobacco and oak. Gritty tannins and inconsistently ripened fruit lend this wine a common touch. It's certainly not an ager, but it is an appealing wine to drink now.",26.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
18610,Alma Rosa 2007 El Jabalí Vineyard - Mt. Eden Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows a real Burgundian-style earthiness, with rich humous, mushroom and gamy, leathery flavors, marbled with a deep well of spicy plum sauce. This earthy richness, with the distinct tannins, suggests ageability for this dry wine. Best after 2009.",49.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18621,Merry Edwards 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Acidity marks this ripe, delicious wine, giving it a tartness that works to balance the extraordinarily ripe flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, mulberries and pomegranates all mingle together, with spice and cedar complications, and the finish is totally dry and somewhat tannic. Great now, and should hold for a good six years.",36.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
18622,Talley 2006 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"There's a fine Pinot Noir in the bottle, but it needs a little time to come around. Tasted in the Fall of 2008, it was a bit hard in tannins, which masked the fruit. But there's a polished core of wild blackberries, cherries, cola and red plums that suggest aging through 2009, if you can keep your hands off it.",32.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
18645,Longoria 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience.",32.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
18658,Woodenhead 2011 Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"Unfined and unfiltered, this has a deep garnet color with a little smoky touch at the rim. The aromas resemble ripe cherries and cola, the flavors emphasize both fruit and savory components like sage and smoke and the feel is nicely dry. The way it holds back a bit on richness is fine for a change.",38.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
18671,Balletto 2012 Sexton Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a burly amount of black fruit and black tea in this estate wine, concentrated and coiled in a tight tannic structure. The fruit tends toward ripe black cherry and even blackberry, the texture is soft and the finish delightfully marked by a touch of chocolate.",42.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

18700,De Loach 2010 OFS Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is an absolutely lovely Pinot Noir that's softly refined and balanced, yet so complex. It's silky and dry, with waves of raspberries and cherries, red currants, mocha, red licorice and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now–2015 for fresh appeal.",40.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18706,Masút 2011 Block 11 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"A very earthy Pinot Noir with tinges of mushroom and leather. This is a fine, sipping wine that's concentrated and smooth. A perfect companion to rustic foods, like pork tenderloin or richly sauced pulled-pork sandwiches.",55.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18827,Adelaida 2010 HMR Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"The chocolate and black-cherry jam flavors are a little too heavy and rich, lacking zest and complexity. But there's no denying this Pinot is delicious to drink now.",40.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18828,Alta Maria 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A bit on the brawny side of Pinot Noir, with jagged tannins and plenty of full-bodied cherry fruit. Not a bad wine, but lacking the delicacy of the 2008 and 2009 vintages.",28.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18829,August West 2011 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lots of enjoyable cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors in this dry, crisp Pinot Noir.

18830,Babcock 2011 Psi Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows a dry, acidic profile, with tantalizing raspberry and sour-cherry candy and sweet oak flavors. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18831,Babcock 2011 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere, but it does have dryness and vital acidity in its favor.",60.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18834,Torii Mor 2010 Dundee Hills Select Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.",45.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18839,Woodenhead 2010 Wet Kiss Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An easy, delicious Pinot Noir, this is dry and brisk in acidity, with rich cherry, cola, cranberry and sweet oak flavors. The silky texture makes it especially drinkable now.",52.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
18873,Twomey 2011 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"From the Ferrington and Monument Tree Vineyards, the latter now owned by Twomey, this delicate Pinot has an aura of baked bread on the nose followed by just-ripe Bing cherry. With firm tannins and a subtle texture, it is a delight to drink and to pair. You couldn't go wrong with a pork roast swaddled in mushrooms.",46.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18876,Foxen 2011 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Enormously rich, showing cola, black cherry pie filling and even some dark chocolate notes. There's a soft sweetness of fruit and oak that suggests drinking this lovely wine now. You can't go wrong with a grilled steak, or carne asada.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18878,Goldeneye 2010 Ten Degrees Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Goldeneye's estate-grown Pinot, much of it from Gowan Creek Vineyard, this wine is intended to be the best blend from the best barrels. Powerful, with a ripe mouthful of blueberry, it is framed well by oak, giving it a roasted quality and suggestion of forest floor.",110.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18887,Goldeneye 2010 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"What stands out about Confluence most is its wealth of plush mushroom and woodsy earth accenting the otherwise rich, ripe, black cherry flavor. Powerful, it offers Anderson Valley's nuances, a dash of spice and bright acidity.",80.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18888,Goldeneye 2010 The Narrows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"From a cool site, The Narrows is rich in ripe, dark cherry and a touch of herb, offering concentrated and intense flavors, with plenty of acidity to pair alongside a dish like roast pork tenderloin with rosemary or Quiche Lorraine.",80.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18891,Foxen 2011 Block 8 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"There's a severity of acids and tannins that limits this Pinot's immediate enjoyment. It feels tight and hard, despite a core of black and red cherries and the sweetness of toasty oak. All indications point to the cellar. Give it 6–7 years, and it could be going strong well after 2020.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
18923,Love & Squalor 2014 Sunny Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf.",52.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
18930,Hawley 2014 Oehlman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy with subtle Asian spice and forest floor scents, this wine is medium in build and generous in tannin, still untangling its limbs in the glass.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
18933,Carabella 2014 Inchinnan Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
18989,Sebastiani 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light bodied and modest in flavor, with lots of acidity. You find yourself wishing there was more in the way of fruit. Still, it's pretty good for the price, with a nice, silky texture.",18.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
18992,MacRostie 2008 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's something off in the aroma, which is herbal and peppery. Turns richer once you take a sip, with pleasantly dry, crisp cherry candy, white pepper and oak flavors. The vineyard is in a cool site, and it tastes like the grapes were not fully ripe. A disappointment after so many great bottlings from MacRostie.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19011,Silver Mountain 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A perfect shade of medium pink, this is a standard, down-the-middle rose. Lemon, watermelon and fresh-cut cherry-tomato notes play on the nose, while the palate packs raspberry and Key-lime flavors.",17.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19024,Portola Vineyards 2012 Los Trancos Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley),"Grown along the Bay Area's Peninsula near the heart of Silicon Valley, this wine is brisk and energetic, with raspberry, pomegranate, dried ginger, sage, rose petals and lavender on the nose. Earthiness leads the slightly sour palate, with turned dirt, juniper and iron, finishing on a menthol sensation.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19055,San Simeon 2009 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"A good everyday Pinot Noir, tart in acids and with some edgy tannins. But it has the variety's nice, silky texture, with rich cherry, rosehip tea and sandalwood flavors.",18.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19057,Tyee 2008 Estate Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Light and tart, with high acid cranberry fruit flavors. It's clean and straightforward, though the old vines (some are 34 years old) do not deliver the complexity that might be anticipated.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19071,Marimar Estate 2014 Don Miguel Vineyard Earthquake Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With a reductive quality and prominent oak, this is a thick, concentrated wine built on unwavering tannins. The fruit is elusive and shy. Clove and cola eke out of an earthy element that's part rose garden, part smoke and eucalyptus.",59.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19073,Flowers 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dry and weighty at first on the palate, this wine is ultimately tart and tangy, awash in grippy acidity sparked by flavors of cherry and lime.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19112,En Garde 2013 Starkey Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a smooth, well-mannered and distinctly varietal wine, richly rewarding in cola spice and earthy black tea, with a juicy finish.",54.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19149,Ken Brown 2013 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dark strawberry and red-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by the regional pioneer, leveled by scents of violets, rose petals and pencil lead.

19150,Le Cadeau 2014 Merci Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Subtle fruit flavors mingle mountain berries, plums and cherries with enticing baking spices. There's a touch of herb, earth and tanned leather also, bringing complexity and texture into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020.",80.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19193,Fulcrum 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This Pinot tastes young and undeveloped, but it should go places. Evidence of its youth lies in the big tannins and acids and the way the fruit flavors are so fresh and primary. Although it's delicious in berries and currants, it just hasn't pulled together. It's so balanced it should benefit from 4–5 years in a cellar.",54.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19202,Wild Horse 2008 Cheval Sauvage Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Lightly silky, this has mouth-cleansing acidity and delicious red-cherry pie, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's really easy to drink now, elegant and complex. You can even give it a little chill on a hot night.",60.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19214,Loma Prieta 2007 Saveria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Dry and briskly acidic, this is rich in cherry, mocha and spice flavors that are just starting to turn the corner and develop aged bottle notes. Fascinating now, it should continue to evolve over the next several years, gradually dropping fruit and picking up earthiness.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19217,Sinor-LaVallee 2008 Anniversary Cuvée Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Falls off a notch from the '07, with tart acidity and sweet oak dominating. The depth just isn't there, although it's certainly a fine wine. Tastes like buttered cinnamon toast spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with white pepper and cocoa.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19218,Talisman 2007 Adastra Vineyard Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"A good, rich wine, brimming with ripe, fruity raspberries and cherries and lots of savory spices. Feels a bit rustic, with a sweet, caramelized finish. Drink soon.",46.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19229,Lane Tanner 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian. But it's richly sweet in raspberries and cherries, and the smoky oak is nicely integrated with the fruit. A pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19240,Roessler 2008 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the coolness of the vintage with a tartly acidic mouthfeel that gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy feel. Other flavors include mint and a pleasantly sweet touch of butterscotch from oak. Other than the sharpness, this is a pretty nice Pinot.",46.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19248,Twomey 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"A good, polished Pinot for drinking now. It's brisk in acidity and has a hint of green mint, but the raspberry, cherry and cedar flavors are delicious.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19285,W.H. Smith 2006 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Raspberries, cherries, cola, tea, rhubarb pie, licorice, vanilla and sweet leather flavors flood the mouth, wrapped in a delicately silky, complex texture, and the finish goes on and on in oak-inspired fruit and Asian spices. Compellingly delicious; drinks now and through 2009.",48.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
19290,Patz & Hall 2005 Chenoweth Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced. Cherries, raspberries and blackberries flood the palate, enriched with earthier notes of balsam, cola, soy, licorice and spice. Drink now through 2011.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
19293,W.H. Smith 2006 Maritime Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the precision and control of Smith's previous Maritime Pinot, marked by a tense, exciting structure.

Best now through 2010.",54.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
19297,Gainey 2005 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is Gainey's basic '05 Pinot, and it shows the quality of the vintage. The wine is dry, crisp in acidity and under 14% in alcohol, with dramatic cherry and boysenberry fruit complexed with leather, cola, Chinese five spice and balsamic notes. Fairly tannic, it's best now and for a few years.",30.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19307,Stone Wolf 2012 Barrel Select Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing.",14.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
19309,Coelho 2012 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tight and tart, this is packed with concentrated, high-acid flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The wine is young and fresh, with both grip and depth, and should age nicely through 2019–2021.",25.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
19316,Kobler 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Delicately floral in aroma, this soft, earthy Pinot offers blue and red berry fruit that are layered and generous on the finish. Food-friendly, it has the heft to stand up to bigger, bolder flavors on the plate or suffice as a sipping wine on its own.",38.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
19327,Arista 2009 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tastes young and acidic but weirdly ripe now, with jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors and a tart finish. The question is whether it will age. Unlikely, but you never know.",58.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19328,Arista 2009 Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This is a big Pinot Noir, full-bodied and dry, and a little heavy. But it's rich, offering delicious waves of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, cola and savory spices. Unclear if it will age, but nice now with steaks, chops, grilled salmon.",38.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19382,Marimar Estate 2007 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Massive, flamboyantly rich, a real treasure in the mouth. Just dazzles with the intensity of cherries, black raspberries, Dr. Pepper, plums, sweet vanilla-scented sandalwood and a wild array of savory spices. The wine is a small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, which is in the heart of the Green Valley. Drink now and through 2013, at least.",49.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
19400,Chime 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"At this price with Pinot Noir, you never know what you're going to get. Chime's track record is all over the board. With this 2012 vintage, their California Pinot Noir is average, and fairly priced. It's light and silky, with raspberry sour candy flavors.",13.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
19422,Cattleya 2012 Donum Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Big and bold, this emphasizes flavor impact. Attractively deep in hue, it stays ruby-colored and fresh-looking at the rim. An oak influence shows in the vivid vanilla and light maple syrup aromas and carries over to the flavors that show a vein of ripe berry fruit, too. Full bodied and velvety in texture, it has ample tannins that help carry flavors to the finish.",85.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19424,William Hatcher 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Hatcher delivers excellent value. Concentrated black cherry fruit runs on through a delicious, cherry cola finish. It's dusted with cinnamon and sassafras, and built for cellaring through 2024.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19426,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Outland Ridge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.",35.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19460,Fire and Oak 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This shows red cherry fruit accented by a black sage and sweet pine twist on the nose.

19498,Pali 2009 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Make this wine a little drier and the score would rise. As things are, it's just too sweet and one-dimensional in jammy raspberries and cherries, while oak brings buttered toast and roasted coconut flavors that are candy sweet. Good as it is, it palls after a while.",48.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19509,De Loach 2009 Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Give this dry elegant Pinot 4–5 years in the cellar to soften and mellow. Right now, the tannins dominate, making it tough. Underneath are fascinatingly earthy flavors of cherries, cola, mushrooms and exotic spices.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19525,Balletto 2009 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Shows the ripe fruit of Balletto's Pinot Noirs, with bright, forward raspberries and cherries. But there's an appealing earthiness, something like wild mushrooms sautéed in olive oil. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast. Drink now–2015.",34.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19570,Clos La Chance 2005 Erwin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's a tight, muted quality to this wine. While it floods the mouth with cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, the acids and tannins are Burgundian, suggesting ageability. You can drink it now, but decanting is advisable. Otherwise, stick it in the cellar until sometime in 2009 or 2010.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19589,Davis Bynum 2011 Jane's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A fine Pinot from this veteran producer. They haven't lost their deft touch despite changes in ownership. The wine is classic Russian River, showing full-throttle berry-cherry fruit, balanced with good acidity, while maintaining a delicate mouthfeel. It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19593,J. Christopher 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fine entry-level Pinot Noir to introduce J. Christopher's expansive single vineyard offerings. This is balanced and true to variety, with clean Pinot cherry cola fruit flavor. There is just a delicate sense of underlying earth and leaf, adding some welcome complexity. Drink over the next 3–5 years.",28.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19609,Château Bianca 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Here's a most Burgundian, delicate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at a price that can sometimes deliver clumsy, thin, and/or vegetal flavors. This has varietally-true detail, clean fruit and delightful nuances of citrus, dried herb and rose petals.",17.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19617,Inman Family 2012 Thorn Ridge Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a vineyard farmed by Ted Klopp of Klopp Ranch, this is a light, spicy vineyard-designate, silky smooth in crisp red cherry and berry. A streak of fresh-picked herb overlays the soft wine, which finishes with a taste of wet stone-like minerality.",56.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19726,Francis Coppola 2009 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Coppola turns to a respected grape source for Pinot, and what do you know? This is his best ever. It's a lovely wine, supple and bright, with cherry, pomegranate and spicy persimmon flavors. The 50% new oak is perfectly integrated into the wine's power.",35.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19738,Twomey 2010 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"All of the parts haven't yet come together: The oak, acidity, fruit and tannins hover around, but they're not quite completely harmonious yet. Still, it's very rich, with a massive black-cherry core. It seems to have all the components for a little time in the cellar.",46.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19755,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Angel Camp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This has lots of fresh, lively fruit characteristics in the aroma and the flavor. It's well balanced, showing good firm acidity and fine tannins to blanket the ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's medium bodied, very appetizing and agile.",58.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19763,Alma Rosa 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Deep cherry, sagebrush and cola are laid across wet slate and purple flowers on a complex nose in this appellation-wide blend from Richard Sanford's team. Crushed wild herbs, like mint, sage, thyme and pine needle are prominent on the palate, backed up by a splash of red fruit.",40.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
19780,Spindrift Cellars 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle. The finish gets a little tight, with some plastic flavors creeping in.",24.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19790,Greenwood Ridge 2006 Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"The winery has struggled with Pinot made from this warm, sunny highland appellation, which is more suitable for Zinfandel. Their '06 is a savory wine, dry and rich in cherries and oak, with a silky texture. But there's a heaviness that makes you think Pinot isn't the best grape to grow this far above the Anderson Valley fogline.",27.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
19794,Boedecker Cellars 2005 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level.",45.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19795,Capitello 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy! In a world where so many Oregon wineries are making Pinot Noir that is superripe, extracted and alcoholic, this shows why the Burgundy comparison is still valid.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19796,WillaKenzie Estate 2005 Pierre Léon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pierre Léon is a selection of different clones from the winery estate. Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal.",36.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
19798,Domaine Meriwether 2004 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.",30.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
19821,Bogle 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A bit weedy and thin in fruit, but not bad for the price. It's a dry, silky wine, with gentle flavors of cherries, mint, cola and sandalwood.",13.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
19827,Buena Vista 2007 Swan Selection Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Ripe and rich, but rather heavy and softly sweet, this wine lacks the vibrancy and elegance you want in a fine Pinot Noir, especially at this price. It's a decent everyday wine, with cola, rhubarb pie and cherry flavors.",42.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
19835,Buena Vista 2007 Ramal Vineyard Dijon Clones Estate Vineyard Series Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Oak dominates this wine, towering over everything else and offering a strong dose of caramel, hardened by wood tannins. There are some good cherry and red currant flavors, but they're swamped by the barrel regimen. Disappointing for this fine Carneros vineyard.",42.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
19845,Lundeen 2014 La Cantera Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
19875,Goldeneye 2012 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Subtlety and a savory quality help this wine stand out from the rest of the Goldeneye lineup. It has meaty, slightly peppery aromas along with subtle cherry scents, a plush, almost soft texture and delicious, moderately ripe flavors like pomegranate and black cherry.",82.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19879,Patz & Hall 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pungent, spicy earth and cinnamon rise out of the wine's bouquet, inviting one to enjoy a structured expression of cranberry, raspberry and black tea. The tannin structure is well managed and the oak strong, yet integrated. Gap's Crown is among the vineyards that figure into the blend, along with several Dutton family properties. This is fresh and focused.",46.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19880,Pellegrini 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Silky smooth and delicate, this comes from a long-standing family-run winery in the heart of the appellation. It's a subtle, floral wine offering layers of dark plum and strawberry. Medium-weight and tangy in acidity, black tea and toffee notes linger on the finish.",30.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19885,Talbott 2013 Logan Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price.",25.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19886,Tolosa 2012 Beyond Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Roasted beets and beef aromas combine with scarlet-red rose petals, peppercorns, black clove, cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose of this wine. The palate offers more cinnamon and purple flowers, with herbal lift from thyme as well as a solidly structurd frame that ensures this bottle will last quite a while.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
19911,Winter's Hill 2014 Single Block Series Block 1 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The aromatics suggest rose petals, while the tart fruit flavors run to raspberries and citrus. The freshness and complexity hint at further improvement over the next three to five years.",49.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19915,Amalie Robert 2012 Amalie's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This cuvée has the prettiest aromatics of the entire 2012 lineup, highlighted with rose petals and spice. Apples and cranberries are the fruit components, amped up with stiff acidity. It finishes with a faint touch of chocolate.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19921,Bucher 2014 Bucher Vineyard Three Sixty Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Three Sixty comes from four blocks of the Bucher Vineyard, planted to a range of clones. Made in small amounts, it offers a wealth and breadth of black cherry, vanilla and smoky oak, the tannins softened and well integrated into the whole. It takes on savory aspects of coffee and clove as it opens.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19933,Bernardus 2009 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Enormously ripe, as you'd expect from this famous vineyard. Explodes in red cherries, licorice, cola, anise and smoky sandalwood, so rich and deep and long in the finish. Plenty of racy acidity provides balance. You might want to give this Pinot a few years in the cellar to calm down.",80.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19937,ZD 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Earns extra credit for the sheer audacity of ripe cherry, raspberry and vanilla cream flavors. Almost as sweet as a candy bar, but actually dry, and balanced with acidity and minerals. A fine Pinot Noir that should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19938,Heart O' The Mountain 2008 Triple Seven Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A big Pinot Noir, darkly colored and full-bodied in the mouth. The depth of fruit is impressive, packing a solid core of black cherries and plums. Might gain some bottle notes over the next 4–6 years.",52.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
19950,Fess Parker 2015 Parker West Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From the family's westernmost vineyard, this bottling is fabulously complex. It shows dense dried fruit and turned earth aromas, along with chaparral, smoke, clove and nutmeg. Those wild elements figure strongly on the sip, which shows thyme, rosemary and sagebrush accents around a core of plum, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors. A vanilla flair graces the finish.",58.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19959,Lucienne 2015 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"As it opens, this wine's ever-so-slightly-dried black-cherry aroma emerges with elegance and power, alongside unending layers of potpourri, crushed flowers, juniper and dark spice. The palate leads with a tart cranberry note that broadens into a warmer strawberry flavor, laced together with tingling acidity and sagebrush spice.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19966,Bethel Heights 2015 Justice Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Juicy dark-purple fruits hold the center of this supple, engaging wine that's still young, with chewy tannins. There's tangy bite to the acids and plenty of muscle for aging. Drink 2020 through 2030 and possibly longer.",56.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19967,Comartin 2015 R-Bar-R Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"From a vineyard at 1,100 feet elevation in the southern part of the appellation, this bottling shows light and lively raspberry, plum, white pepper, fennel and damp herb aromas. The palate abounds with red fruit, well-woven acidity and layers of herbs. A raspberry jam note pops on the finish.",45.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19968,Della 2015 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy forest floor and sage notes make for a savory experience in this otherwise juicy wine. Robust, full-bodied and concentrated, it offers developed flavors of baked plum, strawberry and rhubarb compote, the fruit edged with menthol.",70.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19969,Della 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From four vineyard sites across the appellation, this coastal wine shows an intriguing note of rose petal and turned earth before unleashing full-bodied waves of chewy, cool-climate tannin. Its rhubarb and red cherry fruit has a savory edge; acidity carries it long into the finish.",60.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
19975,Niner 2012 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Niner's Paso Robles Bordeaux-style reds have attracted attention. Now the winery turns to Pinot Noir, but they wisely turn to the cooler Edna Valley. The resulting wine is dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with pleasant raspberry and sandalwood flavors.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20002,Freeman 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Very ripe and deliciously forward in cherries, cola, bacon, anise and sweet smoky sandalwood, with silky tannins. The acidity is a bit low, giving the wine a softness that limits ageability. Now–2011.",44.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20020,Siduri 2008 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Released too young, at just over a year of age, this Pinot tastes sugary, with primary fruit essence, glycerine, alcohol and caramelized oak giving it an uncomfortable sweetness. It's probably technically dry, and should actually taste dry by 2011, but it's certainly not ready to drink before mid-2010.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20049,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20065,Left Coast Cellars 2011 Latitude 45 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is stiff and herbal, both in scents and flavors. There's a strong streak of earth dampening the light cranberry fruit. The aging in two third new French oak adds a bit of chocolate to the finish.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20077,Fiddlehead 2011 Burtie Baby Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Winemaker Kathy Joseph delivers this seven-barrel ode to her father, who'd be proud of the tight blackberry, wet clay, shaved cedar and iron-rich aromas. The acidity is bountiful but not overpowering on the palate, where elderberry, dried lavender, wild mint and damp earth combine for a deep and lasting sip.",88.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20083,Red Stitch 2014 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This wine by retired baseball stars Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts shows both ripeness and restraint in all corners. On the nose, that means star anise and slate layered across black cherry and blackberry fruit. On the palate, the very full mouthfeel packs thyme, crushed herbs and elderberry flavors into an earthy package.",56.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20084,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond.",80.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20088,Claiborne & Churchill 2013 Runestone Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Very tight and linear in all the right ways, this focused wine shows black raspberry, sweet hummingbird sage, clove butter and star anise on the nose. It's even lighter on the palate, where potpourri, olallieberry, black pepper and pencil lead converge. It will age gracefully, thanks to judicious acid and tannins. Drink 2018 through 2028.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20090,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Bright and clear, this young wine is powered by racy cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's a wine that will appeal to those who love primary, juicy, tangy red fruit, but will carry a long way in the cellar for those who value the extra dimensions that well-aged Pinot can convey. Tuck a few bottles away and watch as they blossom into complex wines with dusty elegance. Drink now through 2030.",48.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20092,Rex Hill 2013 Sunny Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Opening scents of cherry blossoms, fresh-picked cherries, and a dusting of powdered chocolate beckon further exploration. Complex and layered, this opens nicely into a full-flavored effort, with black cherry fruit, cola and a touch of dry earth and mushroom compost. The details and length are impressive. Drink now to 2030.",55.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20097,Bethel Heights 2014 Casteel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is the winery's reserve-level cuvée. It's bright and high-toned, offering woody notes around lush cherry and mocha flavors. Delicious already, though more bottle age should further pull the barrel flavors into proper balance. Toasted marshmallow and caramel latté highlights adorn the buttery finish.",75.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20098,Blue Farm 2013 King Ridge Vineyard Estate Farmed Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"From a two-acre site at 1,110-feet elevation only five miles from the Pacific Ocean, this wine opens as if it were a lovely, expansive rose garden, so fragrant and intensely earthy. Built with sizable tannic structure and toasty oak, it features burly waves of spicy acidity and warm baking spices, exhibiting both tension and grace. Drink now through 2023.",80.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20099,Chanin 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The slightest touch of wildfire kicks off the nose, followed by aromas of hibiscus, light cranberry, dried rose petal, roasted pork shank and white pepper. It's quite light upon first sip, then a peppery intensity builds as flavors of underripe raspberry, fresh thyme and dewy oregano arise. For a lighter style of the grape, it's a classic, and stays fresh for days.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
20103,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Gisèle Pinot Noir,"WillaKenzie's most affordable estate-grown Pinot, this opens with a truly lovely bouquet of rose petals, raspberries and dusty chocolate.

20155,Mahoney 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A good, standard Pinot Noir, dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors accented by smoky oak. Drink now.",24.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20163,Ancient Oak Cellars 2009 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Ripe and fruity in raspberries and cherries, this Pinot is also sweet in toasty oak. It has a nice, pleasantly silky texture. Not going anywhere, but good for drinking now.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20190,Anam Cara 2014 Nicholas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A well-balanced mix of highlights: dried herbs, dusty cherry fruit, and a streak of citrus come together in this estate-grown wine. It finishes with a lick of caramel, from aging in 22% new oak.",37.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
20200,Erath 2011 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The 2011 Estate Selection brings flavors of rhubarb, citrus and tart raspberry, along with suggestions of pine needles and chocolate. It's well structured and proportionate—a good reflection of the vintage and Willamette Valley-style Pinot Noir.",34.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
20201,Failla 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a fine Pinot for drinking now. It's dry and brisk with coastal acidity, firm tannins and elaborate raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, touched by sweet, smoky oak.",34.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
20215,J. Christopher 2011 Nuages Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The name comes from a Django tune, and also means “clouds” in French. Nothing cloudy here though—it's a pretty, lively, fruit-driven blend with cherry candy flavors. Crisp and fresh, a streak of cola runs comet-like through the tail, along with a hint of mint.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20246,Rex Hill 2013 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tart, young and focused, this brings cranberry and black cherry fruit forward, with a lively, spicy mouthfeel. Flavors are battened down with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Give this an hour or more of breathing time, or decant.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20264,La Crema 2008 Nine Barrel Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A problematic wine, especially considering the price. It's dark in color, quite tannic and bone dry, with powerful cherry and cola flavors, liberally accented with smoky oak. Has all the hallmarks of an ageable young Pinot Noir, but there's a stubbornly unripe streak of green peppercorn all the way through. Difficult and risky to predict where this wine is going.",90.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
20268,Peters Family 2007 Sonoma Stage Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A little tough and gritty around the edges, a rustic wine rich in extracted cherry and blackberry jam flavors. Plenty of strong tannins and zippy acidity too. Feels unresolved, and the question is whether cellaring will result in improvement. Try after 2012.",49.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
20307,Firesteed 1999 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Pale in color, with delicate Pinot-like aromas of strawberry, beetroot, coffee and hard spices. Drinks lightly fruity, spicy and dry. It's a simple, one-dimensional wine, but a very pretty one, and notable for its polished flavors.",10.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
20315,Talbott 2012 RFT Diamond T Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Cranberry, sour cherry, turned earth, dewy chaparral and anise aromas arise on this bottling from the historic Monterey producer. The mouthfeel is quite full, with sour cherries, leather, tobacco and mocha flavors cut by a judicious amount of acidity.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20318,Byron 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"It's hard to find a tastier Pinot Noir for this price. Aromas of rose petals, pungent violets and raspberry juice show just a touch of chai tea, and the palate proves juicy and fun, with cranberry, pomegranate and raspberry elements. Black tea and mocha flavors add just enough seriousness.",19.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20331,Iron Horse 2012 Home Block Single Clone Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"The inaugural offering of this block-designate is dark and brooding, with tightly constructed, sizable tannins and oak still pronounced on the palate. Time should develop its floral notes of rose and orange peel, with accents of tea, cranberry and pomegranate. Cellar through 2017.",85.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20338,Acacia 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light, clear color betrays a balanced, vibrant wine, nicely weighted in ripe Bing cherry and raspberry. The ethereal nature of things take on body and oak midway through, and a satisfying, herbal earthiness of cola spice. Enjoy through 2022.",65.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20340,Barnett 2013 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Elegant, yet still brimming in meaty tannins, this wine offers deftness on entry, diving deeper into blueberry cobbler and baked bread as it goes. On the nose, roses and cinnamon entice, while mid-weight oak and licorice pull in more savory directions. Ideal through 2021.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20386,Phillips Hill 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Sometimes a blend of vineyards like this one can equal or surpass the single-vineyard bottlings. This complex and well-rounded wine achieves a good balance between seductive fruit flavors and more subtle, woodsy, savory nuances from whole-cluster fermentation, while not going over-the-top in body or oakiness. Each sip uncovers more spice, more cedar and more subtlety.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20390,Sanguis 2013 Loner R13-a Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dark clay, deep layers of earth, black-cherry bread and black-slate aromas show on the nose of this finely woven wine by Matthias Pippig. The palate is distinctive, with rich yet not overripe black-plum loaf, mocha dust and black cardamom spice hiding behind the silky yet dense structure. Excellent now, it will joyously evolve. Drink 2016–2028.",80.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20391,Sante Arcangeli 2014 Split Rail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Light in color but bursting with aromas of candied cherry, pencil lead, sauteed porcini mushrooms and rain-soaked gravel, this is a fabulous wine from an oceanview vineyard above Corralitos. Italian spices of oregano and bay leaf combine with a sesame-oil warmth and bright raspberry fruit on the zesty palate.",45.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20392,Domaine J. Meuret 2013 Phelps Creek Vineyard Les Chênes Pinot Noir (Oregon),"It takes a precision winemaker to craft a Pinot Noir with such detail from a cool vintage in a cool region. Jon Meuret (founder of Maison Bleue) has the right stuff, as this new project demonstrates. Drink it now for its pure raspberry and cranberry fruit, its lightly rendered oak, its length and texture. Or wait 8–10 years and watch it develop into a complex, elegant wine with mature fruit and polished, terroir-driven flavors. Drink now through 2026.",39.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20394,Westwood 2014 Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),"A lovely bouquet of dusty rose petals marks the entry of this delightful wine. Softly textured, it's subtle in tannin and oak, with interweaving swathes of black tea and grenadine-intense cherry. Medium bodied, it remains silky and fresh through the lengthy finish.",44.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20397,Sojourn 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a gentle giant of a wine, subtle and sublime in earthy rose petals, allspice and black tea that maintain a spiky, lively acidity throughout. Blueberry and black cherry compete for attention, balancing the grapes' more savory intentions, before a smoothly intense finish rides things out.",59.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20399,J. Christopher 2013 Olenik Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Expressive and loaded with fruit, mineral and spice components, this powerful wine centers around dense flavors of black cherry and cassis. Threads of coffee, caramel, wet rock and citrus keep coming through, and the wine seems to gain strength as it goes. Just a hint of heat comes out in the tail end.",58.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20440,Belle Glos 2008 Clark & Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Tremendously rich and ripe, this Pinot just dazzles the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, bacon and other intense umami flavors. It's dry and silky, but the drawback is excessive softness.",44.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20453,Trisaetum 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This light, elegant wine uses estate-grown fruit, and brings the same general character as the single vineyard offerings. Briary berry fruit, with pepper and spice, shows a more herbal aspect than the single vineyard wines. Sealed in screwcap, this wine may be enjoyed over the next 4–6 years.",36.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20469,Chessman 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"There's hearty earthiness and darkness to this bottling, with black plum, beets, cola, rhubarb, turned earth and a light asphalt character to the nose. The palate is framed by aggressive acidity, showing flavors of dark red fruit, clove, plum skin and dried herbs.",20.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20476,Laurelwood 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a solid, ready-to-drink effort, with forward flavors of raspberry and cherry. The well-managed tannins remain in the background, but put a definite edge around the finish, which wraps up quickly.",26.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20480,Firesteed 2005 Citation Pinot Noir (Oregon),"In some vintages (such as 2004) the extended bottle age given to the Citation Pinot works in its favor. In this latest release, it has subtracted from, rather than added to, rather ordinary fruit flavors. Leather notes in both scent and flavor come up against raisined fruit. Tannins are tough and astringent, and there is a stemmy character to the finish. Drink up.",75.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20482,Irvine Family Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A reductive, bitter rubber component stubbornly dominates this wine. There's cranberry and rhubarb fruit, ample acids, and otherwise all is in balance. But that burnt rubber note carries right through the finish. Two bottles were tasted with similar results.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
20496,TeBri Vineyards 2009 Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Select bottling, which appears to be TeBri's reserve, shows medium concentration, with strawberry and cherry flavors. Cola, earth, caramel and chocolate notes come together on the pretty finish.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
20523,WillaKenzie Estate 2012 Aliette Pinot Noir,"This selection is from the winery's first planted vineyard, now nearing 20 years of age. It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age.",48.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20526,Scott Paul 2012 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has.",39.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20531,Big Basin 2012 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Another wildly complicated Pinot Noir from Bradley Brown, this smells of crimini mushrooms, smoldering chemise and sweet cherry tomato reduction sauce, with a pinch of cinnamon. It's lush with soft red and purple fruit once sipped, with smoky spice on the edges and smashed olives throughout.",44.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20542,Domaine Serene 2011 Winery Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking.",85.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20543,Reata 2011 Pinot Noir (Napa County-Sonoma County),"Tightly wound and dry, this is an elegant, fruity Pinot marked by tart flavors of cranberries and pomegranates and relieved by richer notes of cherry pie and sweet oak. Turns sharp on the finish, with a cut of acidity. Drink up.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20557,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Heritage Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes as ripe, bright and spicy as it smells, with intense, pure flavors of raspberry, strawberry and cherry essence dusted with crushed white pepper, cinnamon and vanilla. Drink this light-bodied, savory young Pinot now and over the next year or two.",55.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20563,Walt 2011 Rita's Crown Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"With luscious raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors, this silky Pinot is ready to drink now. It has a good structure of tannins and acids, as well as lots of new oak, which it handles well.",60.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20569,Longboard 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Longboard shies away from overt fruit in favor of earthier tobacco flavors in this dry, complex and tannic young Pinot Noir. That doesn't mean you won't find plenty of raspberries and cherries. The wine is dry, delicately structured and frankly delicious, making it Longboard's best Pinot Noir ever. Drink now–2019 as it gradually sheds fruit.",33.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20572,Archery Summit 2011 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Fruit from this 12-acre site has a well-rounded aspect, with nuanced flavors of pomegranate, marionberry, black cherry and cola. Hints of game and cured meat come through also, and the mouthfeel is sleek and wiry. It's drinking well but could certainly be cellared through 2024.",85.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20573,Babcock 2012 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"All the parts are here to make this Pinot a lovely companion to appropriate beef, pork and game dishes, especially if wild mushrooms are involved. The wine is utterly dry and bright in acidity, and the tannins are fairly thick for a Pinot Noir. The black cherry, pomegranate, leather, black pepper and sandalwood flavors are appealing now, but the wine should develop bottle complexity until 2020.",60.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20582,Windstream 2012 Sarmento Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"While this bottling is always interesting, it is dependent on vintage conditions. This bottling, from the excellent 2012 harvest, is Windstream's best ever, a provocative example of a cool-climate Pinot from a fine vineyard in an excellent year. It's bone dry, tart in acidity and hugely complex, offering layers of raspberry sour candy, cherry-pie filling, persimmons, tobacco spices and just a touch of smoky oak. The mouthfeel is silky and delightful. As good as this wine is, give it at least until 2018 to develop further.",40.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20583,Davis Family 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Some Pinot Noirs are soft and lush. Others are lean and tart. This Pinot is a little of both. A blend of the winery's three single-vineyard 2011s, it shows the qualities of them all. The result is dry, tart, elegant and ready to drink now. You'll find acid-driven sour-cherry candy, persimmon and tobacco spice flavors, with a touch of smoky oak.",45.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
20600,Vista Hills 2011 Marylhurst Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish.",36.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
20619,Rancho Sisquoc 2015 Flood Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Light and fresh aromas of strawberry and raspberry meet with licorice and vanilla on the bright, fruit-punch-like nose of this bottling. There is snappy energy to the palate, with pomegranate and tannin-laced cranberry flavors as well as a light dusting of baking spice.",30.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
20669,Fort Ross 2012 Fort Ross Vineyard Sea Slopes Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Pleasantly pungent in ripe damson plum, this Pinot has lovely acidity, giving it a spicy mouthfeel around firmly present tannins. Full-bodied midpalate, the wine mellows through to the finish, ending in juicy fruit and earth.",42.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20672,Babcock 2012 Appellation's Edge Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Bryan Babcock's three decades of experience show better than ever right now. This bottling from Radian Vineyard offers aromas of charred cloves, wet slate, peppercorns and macerated raspberries. Lively and energetic on the palate, it bursts with flavors of wild berries and ripe cranberries, with a tart citrusy twist that's a wakeup call to the mouth.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20678,J Vineyards & Winery 2012 Nicole's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Nicole's is a consistent stunner, upholding its reputation just fine with this vintage, a vibrant and spicy take on rich, robust cherry and black raspberry that's both juicy and smooth. The finish wraps up nicely with a take on dark chocolate and mint.",65.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20679,Wayfarer 2012 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"From one block of the estate vineyard planted exclusively to Dijon clone 667, Paige's is deep and dark in color, intense in oak and earthiness, almost a quarter of it undergoing whole cluster fermentation. As intense on the palate as it is darkly hued, it offers brambly blackberry and dark cherry around a core of wild Tahitian vanilla and cinnamon-cardamom spice.",125.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20689,Dutton-Goldfield 2012 Fox Den Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice.

20690,Foxen 2012 John Sebastiano Vinyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A powerful, brooding nose of black cardamom and crushed clove melds with pomegranate and cherry, resulting in an incredibly aromatic wine that hails from a popular vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. The flavors are also quite deep—sour cherry, mocha, more clove—atop layers of bitter plum peels and refreshing acid.",48.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
20700,Iris Vineyards 2014 Chalice Estate C Block Pinot Noir (Oregon),"The aromatics jump out, an intriguing mix of cherry fruit, leather, coffee and mocha. This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate. With ample aeration it fills in, finishing with dark fruit, roasted tannins and a little heat.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20706,Loring Wine Company 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"A swell deal for lovers of rich Pinot Noir who can't afford single-vineyard pricing, this countywide blend packs rose petals, stewed red cherries, hibiscus punch, wet gravel, black plum and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is juicy with a wide array of berry and cherry fruit, boosted by gingerbread spice and dark clay minerality. It's ripe but layered.",27.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
20741,En Garde 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Elusive raspberry tries to find its way to the fore of this big-bodied Pinot, its time in oak apparent yet integrated.

20772,Taz 2007 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Too dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, with extracted, jammy flavors of grilled blackberries and cherries, as well as an herbal note of jasmine tea.

20773,Purple Hands 2013 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This well-regarded vineyard shines here, ripening the grapes fully in a challenging vintage.

20792,Vista Hills 2012 Skyraider Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Produced at White Rose winery, this estate bottling is compact and spicy, framing its raspberry and red plum fruit with aromatic herbs.

20822,Garnet Vineyards 2014 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From an estate-farmed vineyard, this medium-bodied wine is earthy and aromatic in baked bread, with soft, moderate acidity.

20829,Drew 2009 Valenti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"The Mendocino Ridge appellation, which is defined by elevation boundaries, borders Anderson Valley. This Pinot shows cool-climate crispness but also fog-free, ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries that are deep and impressive.

20846,Belle Glos 2009 Las Alturas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A big, rich, full-bodied wine, flashy and dramatic. Floods the mouth with cherry-berry flavors, yet somehow feels light and elegant despite the weight and tannins, which is a kind of magic. You'll find all kinds of raspberries, cherries, sandalwood and exotic spices, but the wine isn't really ready. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar.",44.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
20855,Waits-Mast 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot.

21173,Koz 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Campfire smoke, roasted game, black pepper and raspberry greet the nose on this wine from the smooth jazz saxophonist, made in Buellton by the Terravant facility.

21182,Kessler-Haak 2010 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Clone 2A Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),There's a real bite of lime juice that brightens the ripe raspberry and persimmon flavors on this Pinot Noir. Pair with rich meats and cheeses for balance.,42.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21185,Martin Ray 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This winery's Santa Barbara bottling has established a track record as a fine, elegant Pinot Noir at a fair price. It's not one you need to age, but it shows a clean, pure approach, with a silky mouthfeel and classic Pinot flavors of persimmon, cola and mushrooms.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21187,Billsboro 2010 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"High-toned aromas of cherry cola and berry preserves are enticing on this concentrated, fruit-forward Pinot Noir.

21225,Dobbes Family Estate 2012 Quailhurst Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Asian spices, plum jelly and milk chocolate flavors combine in this solid effort, which lacks only a bit more midpalate weight to really excel. As it stands, it is a tasty wine with a slight dip between start and finish.",65.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
21252,Spicy Vines 2016 Nouveau Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413

21259,Left Coast Cellars 2015 Cali's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is still pretty stiff and tight through the midpalate, with fruit ranging from cranberry to raspberry and sour cherry. Tannins leave a slightly green impression; the wine doesn't seem ripe and full flavored. Some extra bottle age might improve it. Drink 2020 to 2024.",24.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21270,Fritz 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Expansive, long and tannic, this wine is robust and powerfully concentrated, the flavors a mixture of tart cranberry, raspberry and black tea.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21276,Sineann 2007 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"The richness of the aroma belies the elegance of this outstanding Pinot Noir. Tightly woven scents of sweet herb, tobacco, clove, forest floor fungus and spicy red fruits provide an introduction to a wine that can only be called svelte. It's as smooth as silk in the mouth, loaded with flavor and polished to a warm glow, which is exactly what it leaves you with after just one sip.",36.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
21284,Rex Hill 2006 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A full, fleshy, lushly fruited Pinot Noir, streaked with espresso and caramel from barrel aging. The fruit and overall structure are up to the challenge of the wood; lots of black cherry and even hints of cassis running through the core. A finish with some noticeable heat supports the 15.4% alcohol reading, but it's a tasty bottle of wine.",52.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
21288,Lemelson 2006 Thea's Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Thea's Selection is Lemelson's “measuring stick” Pinot Noir, as it is a blend of blocks from the different estate vineyards. This elegant release emphasizes aromas of pungent herbs, lifted with hints of rose petal and briary berry. In the mouth there is a lively, sappy, fruit-centric focus, showing concentrated raspberry (framboise) flavors. In short, a thoroughly delicious bottle that makes the case for blends over most single-vineyard offerings in Oregon.",38.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
21334,Ampelos 2008 Rho Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Tastes rustic and harsh, with acidity giving it a sting. The fruit is drying out and turning raisiny.",45.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413

21360,Archery Summit 2011 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Restrained and elegant, this deeply flavored Pinot Noir takes a masculine turn with threads of iron filings, earth and herb.

21379,Donum 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Give this polished young Pinot Noir some time in the cellar to come around.

21385,Donum 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Donum is at the top of it's Pinot Noir game. This is simply wonderful, offering a wealth of red fruit, cola, spice, mineral and earth flavors. The tannins are negotiable, the acidity brisk and clean, the finish dry and long.

21516,Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vintage was kind to this bottling, resulting in fabulously ripe flavors of cherry, black raspberry and cola that finish in a swirl of exotic spices. It's a bit heavy and direct in primary fruit, but the acids and tannins are fine, and should allow this wine to age for the next 6–8 years.",70.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21520,Donum 2009 Thomas Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"An excellent wine—it's big and brawny, but magnificently packed with flavors of briary fruit, cola and spices. It has all the weight, depth and length one could want, yet it never loses its delicacy and elegance. It's pretty tart in acidity, but that could help it develop. Try after 2015.",100.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21527,Gracianna 2014 Estate Mercedes Riverblock Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A rustic nose gives way to a touch of clove and Asian spice, as full-bodied, robustly ripe baked plum and cherry generously provide flavor and power on the palate.

21560,Left Coast Cellars 2004 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A barrel selection, the Suzanne's Reserve is more concentrated than its less expensive sibling (the Cali's Cuvée) but does not have as interesting a flavor set. Here you'll find the tangy cherry fruit is accompanied by sharp acids and chewy tannins. Although it is a 2004 the wine still seems wrapped up and refuses to let go. Give it plenty of air before drinking.",40.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
21562,Siduri 2006 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows the crisp, silky elegance and spicy fruit that characterizes this red hot appellation.

21591,Bruliam 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is one tight young Pinot Noir. You take the first sip, and the acidity hits you, then the tannins, and finally the fruit, which is ripe and vast in raspberries and strawberries. Oak adds smoky caramel to this parfait. Give it until 2018 or 2019, when it should hit its peak.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
21605,Fleur de California 2007 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"For fifteen bucks you get a nice, silky Pinot Noir with some pretty good fruit and crisp, palate-stimulating coastal acidity. The flavors of cherries, currants and cola will play well with a beef taco.",15.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
21625,Riverbench 2010 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is a full-bodied, sumptuous Pinot Noir that's filled with candied, pie-filling flavors of black cherries, licorice, mocha and spices.

21631,Jim Ball 2009 Les Pintades Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Everything about this Pinot is upfront, but it's beautiful. Softly appealing, with a silky mouthfeel, it offers flattering raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with smoky, sweet, buttery notes.

21646,Redhawk 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Redhawk makes a value-priced lineup of Pinots, and in 2009 it is the two least expensive that have the most varietal character and charm. Concentrated cherry candy fruit builds depth and interest with a wash of mint and menthol. It's full-bodied and mouth-filling, and the flavors linger a long time.",18.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21658,LaZarre 2009 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"A solid Pinot Noir, dry and nicely tart in acidity, with raspberry, cherry, cola and mint flavors. It's an easy wine to drink now.",28.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
21663,Patz & Hall 2009 Chenoweth Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Rich and heavy, like a chocolate pastry dessert with blueberry, raspberry and cherry fruit.

21666,Renteria 2008 River Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Not quite ripe, with a vegetal, herbal edge to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The acidity is nice and brisk, and the texture is beautifully silky, but that tug of greenness distracts, and limits ageability.",40.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
21668,Siduri 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Doesn't taste fully ripe, with a wintergreen, minty edge to the raspberries and cherries. Sugary sweet in the finish, too. Shows the difficulties of this extremely cool vintage.",30.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
21740,Boedecker Cellars 2008 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb.

21747,Second Growth 2015 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Young and forward, this pleasant wine brings black-cherry fruit front and center—a good start, but it doesn't really develop any further. It just does a quick and quiet fade out.",30.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
21770,m2 Wines 2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),"This Lodi-based producer shows skill in handling Carneros-grown fruit, putting together a medium-bodied, deliciously earthy wine. It's leathery in texture and exuberant in cardamom, strawberry and burnt orange flavors.",35.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21772,Black Kite 2014 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's an intriguing mix of smokiness, tangy cranberry and sanguine notes on the nose of this bottling from a winery obsessed with the Burgundian style. The palate combines aromatic and woody flavors of juniper, pine needle, bay leaf and eucalyptus with base notes of baked red cherry. Fascinatingly, it's richer in spice than in fruit.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21774,Vidon Vineyard 2014 Brigita Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"These 15-year-old vines deliver additional complexity, further enhanced by native yeast fermentation. This is a delicate wine, but not a wimpy one. Tart berry and cranberry fruit carries a taste of toasted grain as it does a graceful fade through the finish. Give it plenty of air and it really opens up! Drink now through 2022.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

21806,Merry Edwards 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Power vs. finesse. Which wins out? It's pretty much a draw in this blend of various sites throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation. It shows the acidity and dryness of the coast, as well as the long hangtime richness of the vintage, with spicy raspberry and cherry flavors liberally oaked. A gorgeous wine, and a bargain given that it's the least expensive of the winery's 2010 Pinots. Drink now–2014.",39.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21809,Gary Farrell 2011 Toboni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Offers tremendous pleasure now and over the next six years, in a wine that feels elegant and sophisticated. The tannin-acid balance is perfect, giving it a taut firmness, while the raspberry, cherry, plum and cassis flavors are elaborately rich, yet dry in the finish. The vineyard is in the Santa Rosa Plain, a cool area producing Pinots of elegance.",55.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21826,Balletto 2014 Burnside Road Vineyard Emerson Block Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The Emerson Block is a one-acre collection of east-west facing rows that debuted as its own wine in 2012.

21829,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir,"This is bursting with brown baking spice highlights, in aroma and flavor. Moderately plump fig and cherry fruit flavors thin out in the finish, but don't quit. An hour of decanting is a big help.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
21835,Vinum Ferus 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosé brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore.

21847,Suacci Carciere Wines 2012 Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This bottling comes from two Pinot clones planted within a 6.5-acre vineyard in Blucher Valley, a frigid, low-yielding site. On the edge of ripeness, the wine is unusual in orange pith, cranberry and pomegranate with a vividly tangy crispness. Soy, balsam and pine tar provide an edgy character that adds complexity and texture.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21848,Three Sticks 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The second vintage by this producer from this highly regarded vineyard, this wine shows how racy the site can be, cooled from Petaluma Gap winds and fog and yet also robustly capable of ripe, rich red fruit. Measured acidity buoys a densely concentrated wine chewy and bright in pine, dark cherry, cranberry, strawberry and earth. The finish is lean and citrusy. Drink now through 2023.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21849,V. Sattui 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This wine has gorgeous ripe fruit aromas, mouth-filling flavors and a plush, generous texture. A hint of smoke shades the ripe black-cherry aromas. Layered flavors of clove, cedar, pomegranate and rosemary intermingle on the palate. Despite the ripeness and full body, a fine coat of tannins and supportive acidity keep the mouthfeel fresh and appetizing.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
21853,Eric Kent 2013 Sascha Marie Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road.

21869,Black Kite 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From the producer best known for its own Anderson Valley estate wines, this Pinot is varietally rustic in pine needle, dark, baked plum and smoky oak, the oak stylistically reminiscent of many of its other wines.

22003,Apolloni 2007 Olivia Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A hard, tannic wine, this shows concentrated raspberry fruit flavors, but does not have the fullness and texture of this winery's 2006 releases.

22027,Drew 2009 Fog-Eater Pinot Noir (Alexander Valley),"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
22032,Due Cani 2011 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Perhaps because of the cold vintage, the wine is unsatsifyingly dry, tannic and acidic, showing only hints of sour cherry candy, cola and green mint tea. Not an ager, so drink up.",48.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
22049,Due Cani 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This wine, even at the age of four-plus years, remains dry, tannic and acidic. It has modest raspberry and cherry jam fruit, but isn't going anywhere.",43.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
22050,Dutcher Crossing 2012 Maborishi Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The winery specializes in Zinfandel. While the Maboroshi Vineyard has produced great Pinots for other wineries, this one is tough in tannins. Give it a good, long decant and drink up.",42.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413

22065,Gary Farrell 2013 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees.

This is the ripest to date, and has a healthy 14.7% alcohol level, but it retains many of the spice and herbal highlights that keep it interesting.

Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop.

22470,Mistress 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"There's an earthy note of cola that grounds the ripe cherry and pomegranate fruit, giving it depth and complexity. Made from one of the vineyards closest to the coast, this wine provides plenty of Pinot character. Thick tannins and vital acidity suggest aging until at least 2013.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
22483,Bailiwick 2009 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Tight and brittle now, with acidity and dryness starring.

22597,Trinitas 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Marked by bright acidity and jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, this Pinot is nicely silky, but a bit one-dimensional. It has a long, spicy finish. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",45.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413

22623,Freeman 2012 Gloria Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This very substantive wine carries rich and complex flavors on a firm and lively frame.

22857,Acacia 2000 St. Clair Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This one has extreme funky, deep aromas of tree bark and barnyard.

Rita Hills),"Grown in Santa Barbara County pioneer Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, this grabs attention with tobacco smoke and funky earth aromas.

22974,Ternion 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton. The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure. Not exactly the wine for those seeking a red fruit experience, but good for those seeking the savory side of the grape.",23.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413

23035,Erath 2005 Prince Hill Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a thin, hard and tight version of the estate wine. It shows a bit more depth, but it's compact and slow to unravel.

23045,Firesteed 2002 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Firesteed gives even its modestly-priced mid-tier Pinot extra time in bottle, which smoothes out the leafy flavors and softens up the tannins.

23277,Flocchini 2009 Andrea La Rue Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Citrusy acidity gives this dry, silky Pinot Noir a cranberry tartness, which gets the tastebuds whistling. Pair this with lamb, salmon or tuna to help tame the acids.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
23304,Torii Mor 2006 Olalla Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This tastes like fruit from a cooler, perhaps higher altitude site. It's got a bracing minerality that runs through the fruit and gives the wine a solid backbone. Rhubarb and cranberry fruit is tightly laced against that rocky core, with plenty of natural acid propping up the finish. Little oak flavor is evident right now, though 38% of the barrels were new. This wine should be decanted, but as it opens it really shines.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

23393,Treos 2011 Founders Choice Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This reserve-level wine is annotated with interesting highlights of iron, mint and tea leaf, all wrapped around a black-cherry core.

23415,Tondré 2007 Tondré Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Shows the exuberant volume and power of most Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs, with strong, jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and big, sturdy tannins, although the wine never loses its essentially silky texture. Feels juvenile and precocious now. Give it until late 2010 to begin to mellow.",43.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23437,Lucas & Lewellen 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Plump strawberry, strawberry blossoms, candy licorice and pencil lead aromas show on the nose of this wine from viticultural legend Louis Lucas and retired judge Royce Lewellen.

23488,Castle Rock 2013 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"The color is slightly light, the aromas are moderately spicy, and flavors recall baked cherries and plums.

23497,El Lugar 2013 Hawk's Roost Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Minty sage and cedar dot the aromatic profile of this wine that is holding on to tannin and oak with a fierce stubbornness.

23527,Lost Canyon 2010 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Cellar this young wine for 5–6 years to let it mellow. Right now, it's aggressive in tannins and acids.

23531,Kazmer & Blaise 2010 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros),"As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable.

23539,Bonaccorsi 2008 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta.

23541,Demetria 2009 Le Belier Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A huge wine, brimming with ripe cherry, blackberry and cola flavors, housed in a firm structure of acidity and minerality.

23546,Fort Ross 2007 Symposium Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Held back for nearly four years, this Pinot still brims with acidity. Tartness is the shock that precedes columns of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola, bearing banners of exotic spices. A precise, intellectually pure wine, it should be decanted now, and will develop interestingly over the years.",30.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
23547,Arista 2009 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"An elegant Pinot Noir, dry, silky and crisp in acidity, making it a natural for lamb chops or a grilled steak.

23556,Fort Ross 2008 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Elaborately ripe, this polished Pinot explodes with fresh flavors of raspberries and cherries that taste pie-baked, with the smoky, sweet, toasty crust. It's just delicious, and also obviously fruity-sweet, with a jammy attractiveness. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in richness. Drink now.",37.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
23557,Foxen 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block 8 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Exceptionally rich, a Pinot Noir that tastes dramatic from the get go.

23558,Foxen 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",56.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
23568,Pali 2012 Bluffs Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in a more full-bodied style than many other Russian River Pinots, this one's a little heavy and soft.

Best now through 2020.",68.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
23586,WildAire 2014 Yates Conwill Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This vineyard, often featured in the Sineann lineup, moves over to WildAire for this sensational debut. The blend is a two-clone mix of 777 and Pommard, and it captures a range of delicate, well-defined flavors. Raspberry, cherry, light char, smoke, pepper, bitter herb, vanilla and camomile tea come rolling through. The prime location, which borders on Jadot's Résonance vineyard, contributes a great deal, but the winemaking brings it on home.",45.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
23591,Chanin 2014 La Rinconada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Quite light in color, there is a red-cherry and strawberry base to the aroma of this bottling, which is laser-focused and redolent with scents of a morning hike through the chaparral, fresh with wild mint and sage.

23623,Vista Hills 2009 Rollins Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Toasty and tart, this lively wine is built upon wild-picked berry flavors.

23658,Flowers 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a gorgeously light coastal offering, a subdued expression of the variety that unravels its layers slowly and methodically.

23662,Melville 2014 Terraces Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very light in the glass, this bottling is also delicate on the nose in terms of power. But it offers tons of action nonetheless, with fresh and dried herbs, flint and a tiny bit of smoke adding to the red-fruit aromas.

23677,William Hatcher 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Named for the senior partner in the Rex Hill wine group, this single cuvée is always interesting, and never better than in 2014. The lush aromas of new French oak recall young Burgundy, and the tart, tightly wound fruit is clearly built to age.

And, in this wonderfully long hangtime vintage, its flavors are extraordinarily rich and pure, brimming with cherries and raspberries. It shows layers of complexity, yet is too young, with the parts unintegrated. Give it 4–5 years in a cool cellar.",70.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
23809,Notre Vin 2006 Clos Madeleine Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.",90.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
23812,Alta Maria 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",25.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
23823,Domaine Carneros 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This bottling has been getting steadily richer and better over the years and has now reached the point where it's an authentic Carneros beauty. The '06 is a Pinot Noir to drink now, to savor its rasp-berry and cherry freshness, crispness and silky texture.",35.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
23883,Smoke Tree 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Made by longtime Domaine Chandon still-wine Winemaker Joel Burt, this red offers delicious value, sourcing from sites within the Russian River, Sonoma Coast and Carneros AVAs. Coolness and restraint are the guides, the wine light in color and texture, with just touches of spice, strawberry and tea. It finishes juicy, with a citrus flair.",25.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23887,The Withers Winery 2014 English Hill Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a cool site overlooking the ocean in Occidental, this is a feral, earthy wine, with a nose of garden patch, black tea and orange. Juicy at its core, it's structured in smooth tannin. Hints of new oak provide pleasant accents without overburdening the herbal and fruity core.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23895,Windemere 2013 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a very full and deep wine, with aromas of black plum, mulberry, Dr Pepper, mint-chocolate chip and purple flowers. It's hearty on the palate as well, with black tea and rose petals showing alongside thick, rich mulberry, clove and baking spice galore. It's not dainty at all.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
23903,Balletto 2014 Burnside Road Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A vineyard-designate since 2007, this wine shows vigor and volatility in the glass, a mix of white pepper, heightened acidity and an underlay of black tea and forest floor. Brooding in dark berry, it never lets the fruit become entirely ripe, opting instead for savory complexity.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
23929,Fullerton 2014 Five Faces Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years.",33.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23938,Portlandia 2014 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23953,Romililly 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine shows how well the Russian River Valley does with Pinot Noir. Dry and delicate in texture, the wine is also potent in flavor. The fruits range from ripe red cherries and pomegranates to earthier tones of heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now.",35.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
23974,Devona 2013 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Veteran winemaker John Abbott (Chalone, Canoe Ridge, Abeja) jumps back on the Pinot Noir wagon with this new project. This is the second vintage for his Freedom Hill designate, a vintage that was notoriously difficult due to monsoon-like rains mid-harvest. Abbott cajoles the grapes into an elegant, refined expression of high-acid Pinot Noir. Slightly saline, with mountain strawberry fruit and autumnal (forest floor) accents, this is lean but polished, and should cellar well now through 2022.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23977,Eisold-Smith 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This complex, already ready Pinot melds flavors of fruit, root, spice and earth in a bold, almost over-the-top style. Blueberry, root beer, cola and soft leather components come into play, with a dried-cracker character as it resolves in the back of the palate. Best for near term enjoyment.",30.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
23985,Brooks 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Put this into the budget category (for Oregon Pinot Noir) where it shines. Fruity and forward, there's plenty to like in the mix of orange flesh and rind, and strawberry and cherry hard candy. The fruit is backed with ample tannin, and a warm touch of mocha and toast fills in the finish.",28.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
23992,Harry & David 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Dilute and slightly bitter, this does not reflect the warm near-perfect 2014 vintage. Thin generic red fruit comes and goes quickly, with earthy, stemmy tannins left to finish.",25.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
23996,Rascal 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is sour, bitter and just all-around dull tasting. A charmless wine.",13.0,81,1,0.9331578735408413
24009,Lynmar 2014 Monastery Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate.",70.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
24019,Wedell Cellars 2010 Hillside Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"A prime example of why Pinot Noir is great to release later in its life, this six-year-old wine is signing with concentrated strawberry, iron, dried rose petals, stewed black cherry and raw beef. The palate is quite earthy but also packs black plum, vanilla, pepper, thyme and marjoram into a wondrous and complete package.",125.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
24020,Talbott 2010 Kali Hart Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Acidic and minty, this Pinot Noir just doesn't have enough richness, despite some modest cherry and cola flavors. Its dry and silky qualities are pleasant.",21.0,83,1,0.9331578735408413
24036,Talbott 2010 Logan Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's a green, vegetal unripeness to this wine that suggests asparagus. The cool vintage simply didn't provide enough warmth to ripen the grapes, though the alcohol still manages to be quite high, which gives the wine a hot feeling.",25.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
24038,Thomas Scott 2010 Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Simple and sharp in acidity, this Pinot has a jammy raspberry flavor. It tastes sugary-sweet all through the finish. It was tasted twice.",26.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
24061,Erath 2010 Prince Hill 777 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Delicate and pretty, this has a pale cherry flavor, with light but proportionate tannins. It fades a bit quickly, offering a final hint of milk chocolate.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24065,Grandmaster 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"From a demanding vintage, this offers tart cranberry and rhubarb flavors, with a forceful herbal component. It's well-structured, offering citrusy acids and good length to the finish.",14.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24081,La Rochelle 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Sweetly caramelized, smoky oak, with all of its vanilla and wood sap flavors, dominates this wine, although it does have a considerable framework of raspberries and cherries. Feels a bit one-dimensional, but it's a pretty Pinot Noir, from a good address.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24085,Paul Dolan 2007 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"A very dry, acidic, rather severe Pinot Noir, made in a tighter, leaner style than most. If you find California Pinot too fruity, you'll like the streamlined raspberry, pepper and mineral flavors.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24111,Artesa 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon. It has delicious flavors of cherries and pomegranates, along with earthier notes of ripe heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms splashed with Balsamic.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24146,August West 2015 Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Concentrated cherry and plum aromas meet with iron, cinnamon and gingersnap on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. The flavors surpass the aromas in succulence—star anise, nutmeg and bay leaf seemingly wrapped in buttered pastry.",48.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24150,Challen 2013 Zotovich Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The nose of this bottling from actress Challen Cates impresses with its spicy cherry, mulberry, juniper and mace notes. The palate is silky in texture and extremely well integrated, long-lasting and layered, with shiitake mushroom, forest floor, red cherry and earthy loam flavors.",60.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24179,Castle Rock 2007 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"A pretty, lightweight Pinot, showing the variety's silky texture and cherry flavors, but it thins out on the finish.",12.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
24199,Chime 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),This wine has some pleasant layers of black cherry and tea yet is marred by its unresolve between being thin and overly oaked. The earthiness on display is on the funky side of things.,20.0,83,1,0.9331578735408413
24247,Thomas Fogarty 2011 Razorback Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Shows the richness and full body that a young Fogarty Pinot often displays, the result of a warmer growing region. The wine is forward and jammy in red cherries and earthy fruits, such as pomegranates and persimmons, with a spicy finish. Fine now, and will hold for a couple years.",65.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24321,McCall 2013 Corchaug Estate Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"There's plenty of peppy, primary raspberry and cherry flavors here, but they're layered amindst hints of bramble, earth, mushroom and beets. This is an elegant, intensely Old-World Pinot but with New-World ripeness to boot. Spry and vibrantly acidic, it finishes with a fringe of fine-grained, firm tannins.",30.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24325,Municipal Winemakers 2015 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Snappy aromas of black raspberry leap out of the glass along with white pepper and bay leaf in this layered red by David Potter. There is solid ripeness to the sip in the form of tangy plums, pomegranate and cranberry, dusted by dried herbs and pepper. It's very fresh and energetic in style.",36.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24339,Sineann 2009 Schindler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already.",42.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
24368,Hirsch 2011 East Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Winemaker Ross Cobb, formerly with Williams Selyem and Flowers, did his best, but this Pinot tastes acidic and labored. It has lean flavors of strawberries and raspberries and new French oak. The wine isn't showing well now, seemingly a victim of the harsh vintage. Its future is problematic.",85.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
24375,Niner 2012 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Niner's Paso Robles Bordeaux-style reds have attracted attention. Now the winery turns to Pinot Noir, but they wisely turn to the cooler Edna Valley. The resulting wine is dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with pleasant raspberry and sandalwood flavors.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
24378,Jack Creek 2011 Kruse Vineyards Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This is rather dark in color and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. In fact, you might mistake it for Grenache, with its full-throttle cherry, red currant and mocha flavors, not to mention the tannins. You can criticize it for being non-varietal, but it's delicious.",36.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24381,MacMurray Ranch 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With classic raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into a delicately crisp mouthfeel, this is a classic Russian River Pinot for drinking now. Everything about it suggests beef, whether it's in a taco or a full-fledged steak.",28.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24383,Bergström 2011 Le Pré du Col Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This new offering is light and elegant, with tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. There's an herbal edge to the wine, all in proportion, with generous acidity that could reward a few more years in the bottle.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24384,Bernardus 2012 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.",65.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24385,Calera 2011 de Villiers Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Raspberry jam, orange peel and sweet oak flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, not showing much of interest now, but the complexity suggests limited ageability. Try after 2017.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24390,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs 2012 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Dark and brooding in savory mushroom yumminess, Paul Hobbs' more affordable Pinot Noir offers dark cherry and spice in good proportion. Concentrated, lush and perfumed it'll accompany a range of foods enjoyably.",35.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
24398,Sarah's Vineyard 2015 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a fabulous example of a light, balanced wine from the Santa Lucia Highlands, which is perhaps better known for richness. It shows savory aromas of smoked cherries, nose-tickling sage, juniper-laced sausage and cayenne pepper. The palate is energetic, with a pleasant viscosity that carries its cranberry, cherry, thyme, oregano and sandalwood flavors into the finish.",38.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
24410,Dierberg 2014 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick.",44.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
24418,Siduri 2015 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
24422,Arissa Jane 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Too sharp in acidity, with an aggressive mouthfeel. Other than that, the cherry and sandalwood flavors are fine, and the wine is dry and silky. But that tartness is a turnoff.",35.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
24426,Woodside 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Maybe this wine needs some age, but right now it's strong in sweet jammy raspberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out, like a caramelized, sweet vanilla coat. Yet it has good acidity and a fine, silky structure. If only it finished drier and firmer.",36.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
24453,Trombetta 2010 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"An awkward Pinot, soft and sweet in raspberry fig Newton cookie and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The alcohol is pretty high, and shows in the form of heat. Lacks the delicacy you expect from this fine vineyard.",58.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
24457,Manzoni 2011 Home Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Strong, candied flavors of cola, cherries, rhubarb pie and persimmons mark this Pinot Noir. While it has a good structure of acids and tannins, and the alcohol isn't too high, it would benefit from greater subtlety and restraint.",35.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
24488,Goyette 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of power and richness in this young, vigorous Pinot Noir. With brisk acids and tannins, it shows complex flavors of cherries, licorice, bacon, cola and Chinese Five Spice. Exotic and interesting, it should develop over the next 3–4 years.",24.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24509,Kessler-Haak 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"More of a mauve color than pink, this wine shows strong cherry notes on the nose as well as seared orange rinds and a slightly boozy rum and coconut element. Mashed cherry pulp and grilled red fruit show on the nose.",23.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
24591,Wedell Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"English breakfast tea, light plum, dark strawberry, rhubarb, thyme and lavender swirl in the heady nose of this bottling. It's elegant and floral on the palate, with more lavender and lots of bergamot and Earl Grey flavors that linger long through the finish.",75.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24613,La Follette 2014 Hawk's Roost Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is both incredibly pretty and wild, a tenacious quality of feral forest and ocean at its core. Honeysuckle and rose provide the beauty first, followed by a depth of gorgeous cherry, strawberry and rhubarb, the fruit alive and fresh atop a gravelly texture of complexity.",42.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24641,Holdredge 2014 Judgment Tree Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is made in tiny amounts, which is heartbreakingly sad given its deliciousness and provenance, the grapes hailing from the Rochioli Sweetwater site on Westside Road. Spice box and sweet black-cherry flavors are lightly oaked and layered with velvety texture, the wine full-bodied and totally balanced.",70.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
24748,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2007 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Densely fruited and full in body, this Pinot offers a whopping mouthful of rich, preserved plum flavor flecked with hints of burnt sugar and dried herbs. Bright acidity and soft, smooth tannins add finesse and elegance.",20.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24750,CULT 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Marked by extreme ripeness, this Pinot is a blast of red cherry pie filling, red licorice and cola flavors, with a smoky note of bacon fat. Delicious, but a bit soft and simple in texture.",48.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
24781,Paul Dolan 2010 Filigreen Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"This is a huge Pinot Noir—big-boned all around—tasting of warm climate fruit, with bulky tannins and a heavy oak presence. Let it open a bit to let out the dark plum and earthy spice flavors.",33.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413

24787,Costa de Oro 2008 Gold Coast Vineyard Reserva Oro Rojo Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Soft and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries. It's luxuriously soft and silky, with polished tannins, and lots of people will love it. Would benefit from greater depth and complexity, but it sure is lovely. Drink now.",35.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24793,Vista Hills 2008 Tusculum Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.",44.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24796,Lange 2008 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Nice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24798,Patton Valley 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fragrant with cranberry and strawberry fruit, this forward and appealing wine looks and drinks like a cru Beaujolais. The tasty fruit is delineated with a chocolate lining, and the tannins carry a whiff of fresh earth.",35.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24802,Brandborg 2007 Bench Lands Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Light and aromatic, this delicate and poised wine seduces with lush aromas of cherries and baking spices. It has the elegance that only fine Pinot Noir can express. Here the subtleties have been coaxed into rich expression, with details of spice and incense and chocolate truffles adding to the lingering finish.",22.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24803,Calera 2007 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Despite appealing raspberry and cherry-pie filling, cola and spice notes, this Pinot is a bit hard and even green, with some tomato notes. The acidity is brisk, the tannins thick. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, and it is likely to develop over a decade.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
24807,Siduri 2015 Bellflower Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Blue and red fruit wrap around ample, tangy acidity in this medium-bodied, velvety textured wine, so classically styled for the appellation. Pomegranate, rhubarb and floral rose are all highlighted along its gradual evolution in the glass.",55.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24809,Hug 2015 Rancho Ontiveros Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Fresh raspberry sorbet aromas meet with an herbal edge of pine oil, eucalyptus leaf, green peppercorn and dark sandalwood on the very compelling nose of this bottling by Edgar Torres. It's extremely lively on the palate, light in body but heavy in acid and tannic structure, with wild thyme, mint and sage decorating the mellow red-fruit flavors.",46.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
24815,Aether Wine Company 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Tart cranberry, orange peel, cinnamon stick, rose petals and mulling spices show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard by longtime regional winemaker Jeff Fink.

24863,Sarah's Vineyard 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lighter in color than many wines from the same appellation, this still packs a complex punch on the nose, with snappy cranberry, crushed slate and peppercorn aromas. The zesty palate conveys baked strawberry, clove and pine forest underbrush flavors.",32.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
24868,Bargetto 2014 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Relatively light tones of vanilla, cranberry, tart plum skin and dried fennel combine for a nicely tight nose on this clonal study.

24872,Cerridwen 2012 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This bold and flavorful wine has a strong black-tea element in the complex flavors, full body and a smooth, mouthcoating texture. It tastes riper and more roasted or beefy than many of its peers and is compelling for its concentration on the palate and length on the finish.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
24953,Pali 2013 Sangiacomo Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish.",58.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
24954,Rexford 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"There's an intriguing herbaceous character of juniper and chaparral scrub on this appellation-blend bottling, along with red currant fruit and iron minerality.

24995,Wedell Cellars 2014 Rose of Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Made from free-run juice, this offers aromas of dried cherries, dessicated watermelon and clove. Plummy fruits and sour cherry show on the palate.",12.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
25021,Asuncion Ridge 2010 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"This 75-case production of Pinot Noir explodes with flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, persimmons, exotic spices and toasty oak. Fine acidity reins all the flavor in, leading to a dry, refined finish. The wine is sourced from grapes in the southern Santa Lucia Mountains. Drink now–2028.",58.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25029,Lucienne 2011 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is the kind of Pinot Noir that's made the variety so popular. While it's not an ager, it gives you everything that Pinot has to offer—­vibrant acidity, a smooth, silky texture and rich flavors of raspberries, cherries and brown sugar, leading to a dry, spicy finish.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25064,Gary Farrell 2012 Hallberg Vineyard Clone 777 Oak Tank Fermented 17% Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine delivers in flavor and aroma, a refined layering of cherry and strawberry that celebrates what this aromatic clone can do in Russian River Valley. Orange peel and tart, tight acidity combine around a silky texture, with a ginger-spice finish and lingering hint of rose petal.",65.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
25065,Guarachi Family 2013 Sun Chase Vineyard Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The producer has chosen to highlight the Petaluma Gap region within the larger Sonoma Coast appellation on this wine, a nod to its recent purchase of the well-regarded Sun Chase Vineyard as well as an endorsement of the Gap becoming an appellation of its own one day. This Pinot might help matters, a beautifully floral mix of rose petal and violet on the nose followed intricately by juicy, subtle red fruit and buoyant acidity.",75.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
25095,Lucienne 2005 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Textbook Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot, big and bold, yet with great textural balance and complexity. Strikes the palate with concentrated cherry, red currant, licorice, orange zest, root beer, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors that are totally dry, with a full-bodied weight.",38.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25100,Phillips Hill 2006 Toulouse Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"From a well-regarded vineyard that's source to several Pinots comes this fine '06. It's silky and dry and crisp and young, with raspberry and cherry jam flavors complexed with smoky oak, green tea and peppery spice. Should age well for the next six years.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25102,Torii Mor 2006 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This single vineyard in the Dundee Hills recalls Oregon Pinots from days gone by. It's not too big, not too oaky, plenty ripe and delivers spicy berry fruit along with earthier streaks of leaf, herb, baking spices and a whiff of cinnamon. Stiff acids and earthy tannins betray its youth, but though still a little rough around the edges, this could be cellared for a decade or more.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25103,Torii Mor 2006 La Cuillère Member's Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This blend mixes the estate fruit with several different vineyards, making a more fruit-forward, accessible wine than the single-vineyard offerings. Flavors show bright raspberry and tart cranberry, leading to some tangy acids, backed with earth, rock and hints of caramel. The new oak is gently applied, adding to the finish without taking away the wine's naturally juicy fruit.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25122,Sineann 2014 Russell-Grooters Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.",36.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25141,Clos LaChance 2012 Murphy's Choice Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25155,Savannah-Chanelle 2006 Armagh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Notable for sheer deliciousness, the way you can't stop at one sip but want more. Soft and gentle, with just a touch of crispness and oak tannins, this Pinot's flavors star. Raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, cola, vanilla all mingle into some fabulously sweet confection that manages to finish thoroughly dry.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
25161,Failla 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Soft and sensual, this Pinot is a real charmer. With a texture as plush as velvet, it offers a tapestry of cherry, black raspberry, currant, chocolate, orange zest and anise flavors that go on and on. Best now for its sheer lusciousness.",34.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
25180,Sierra Madre 2006 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Made in a style so ripe and direct in fruit and oak, it's almost simple, with spun sugar flavors of raspberries, cherries, anise and vanilla. Those flavors are delicious, yet the wine lacks structural integrity.",42.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
25184,Hawley 2006 Oehlman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a light Pinot, both in color and body, with modest flavors of cola, cherryskin and orange tea. It's very dry and nicely silky in the mouth. Seems at its best now.",33.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
25186,MacMurray Ranch 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma),"Comes down on the brittle side, a dry, acidic Pinot Noir with good structure, but lacks the richness you really want. You'll find modest cherry, cola and vanilla flavors.",24.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
25196,Balo 2012 Avenging Angel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This vital, athletic wine is tempting now but will be best to drink after 2018. It has a dark color with a red-brick rim and opulent fruit aromas. Tangy, mouth-filling cherry and raspberry flavors come with a vibrant, tannic, lively texture. It's a bit tight to enjoy now, but will mellow and mature in the cellar.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
25199,Gary Farrell 2012 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine needs some coaxing at first to come out of its shell. Once settled, it entices in warming cardamom, clove and damp earth, taking on savory airs. Exuberant as it develops, it offers high-toned cherry and tangerine that surround a silky, subtle body. Hints of spicy cinnamon and white pepper mark the finish.",70.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
25235,Bennett Valley Cellars 2009 Pinot Noir (Bennett Valley),"Feels soft and creamy in the mouth, with forward raspberry and cherry pie and toasty oak flavors, brightened by punchy acidity. Not an ager, but fine for drinking now.",38.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
25255,Alouette 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"An easy Pinot that shows the variety's silky texture ripe, with sunny flavors of cherries and cola. It's ripe, and fine for drinking now.",25.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
25259,Firesteed 2005 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.",14.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
25265,Lemelson 2005 Meyer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth.",42.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
25285,Cristom 2014 Eileen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This tart, sleek, pretty wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry fruit. Quite young and fresh, it's still rather tight and stubbornly closed, even after breathing for a full 24 hours.",60.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
25287,Fairsing 2014 Sullivan Pinot Noir,"The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.",52.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
25318,Boedecker Cellars 2006 Anderson Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine moves quickly past its tight red currant fruit into flavors of red licorice, hints of caramel and a rather light, almost airy finish. Crisp and well-made, but a bit ambiguous.",45.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
25320,Erath 2006 Juliard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Erath's Juliard bottling has a bit more stiffness and muscle than the wide-open Hyland, but tails off too quickly to be considered as a cellar candidate. The soft strawberry fruit flavors are wrapped in pleasing chocolate, and lightly spicy, toasty details pop up throughout. It just lacks grips and length.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
25341,Balo 2014 Suitcase 828 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Big, rowdy flavors like rhubarb and black cherries seem to fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. Made from an unusual clone smuggled into the U.S. and whole cluster fermentation, it has richness, moderate tannins, and a broad mouthfeel, with little oak flavor showing through.",45.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
25399,Iota Cellars 2011 Pelos Sandberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This winery makes just a single, estate-grown Pinot Noir each year. Pomegranate and red plum fruit flavors are gracefully showcased in this elegant vintage. Silky and smooth, it retains focus through a medium-weight, impeccably clean finish.",38.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25404,Coelho 2012 Paciência Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Ripe strawberry compote typifies this appealing wine. The nicely ripened fruit is set in a mineral-driven, high acid frame, and shows both texture and length as it develops in the mouth. It's especially noteworthy given the moderate alcohol.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25411,Guarachi Family 2012 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles. Aged about a year in all French oak, 65% of it new, it reveals an expanse of dark cherry fruit, velvety texture and plenty of structure amidst a leathery core and lengthy finish.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25501,Keller Estate 2005 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.",150.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
25502,Kynsi 2005 Stone Corral Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"An enormously opulent wine, brimming with gobs of red cherries, currants, mocha, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors. Impresses for the lushness and integrity of the structure. Brilliant wine, just gorgeous, a real crowd-pleaser. With its recent track record, Kynsi enters the front ranks of California Pinot Noir producers.",45.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
25564,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",52.0,97,1,0.9331578735408413
25565,Merry Edwards 2008 Klopp Ranch Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging.",57.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
25566,Lynmar 2009 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",70.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
25567,Merry Edwards 2008 Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",54.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
25568,Lynmar 2009 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel. Gorgeous and compelling, combining power and nuance, it's a wine to drink now and through 2015, at least.",70.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
25569,Center of Effort 2008 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"One of the best Edna Valley Pinot Noirs ever. This region normally produces Pinots with crisp acidity and fine varietal character, and so it is here, with its cherry, black raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. But there's extra depth and complexity, with a wildly exotic, spicy edge, that lift the wine into greatness. Right up there with the best of coastal California. Hard to tell where it's going, but give it a good decant before serving.",40.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
25620,Byington 2013 Byington Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Tight purple fruit smells of black raspberry meet with violets, crushed slate, dried rose petals, raw beef and black peppercorns on the focused nose. The palate is very slate-driven and rocky, offering turned earth, juniper and more dark raspberry flavors. It is still very tightly wound, and needs more time to unfurl.",39.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
25633,Forchini 2012 Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A slip of sour cherry gives zing to this medium-acidity, fruit-forward wine that's both earthy and pinched in toasted oak.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
25674,Halcon 2014 Wentzel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Very tasty and well-balanced, this wine is fresh, smooth and easy to enjoy, and it stayed that way for two days after tasting. It has delicious red cherry and cranberry flavors that blend nicely with the lively texture and medium body. Just the thing when a slightly lighter, more refreshing red is called for.",42.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
25693,Balo 2013 Avenging Angel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A little floral and a lot of fruity and spicy elements make this full-bodied wine delicious and nicely complex. The grape flavors are fully ripe, like blackberry and black cherry, and the texture is broad and juicy without being too soft. It blends grapes from Angel Camp Vineyard with Balo-grown grapes.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
25697,River's Edge 2012 Elkton Cuvée Pinot Noir (Elkton Oregon),"This cuvée saw 20% new oak and is the little sibling to the winery's Barrel Select. It offers the same hint of funk, slightly murky color, and rich, textural makeup. Black cherry, cola, chocolate, bramble and spice are all in play, making for a complex wine that captures your attention.",20.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
25751,Fulcrum 2014 Landy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a mildness to this wine that most tastes of dried cherry and cranberry, with a medium-bodied structure of moderate acidity. Forest floor and earthy compost dominate.",58.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
25798,Inconceivable 2015 The Fog Prince Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Red cherry, ripe cranberry, clove, star anise, dried plum skins and slate converge on the fairly complex nose of this bottling, with a label that features a whimsical map of Santa Barbara County. Light cranberry fruit meets with bay leaf on the sip that offers decent grip.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
25839,Goldeneye 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25847,Pike Road 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price.

25853,Raptor Ridge 2013 Attica Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Delicate yet well-integrated, this emphasizes flavors high in tongue-tickling acidity. Lemon, lime and orange fruit, along with a touch of leather, runs into a finish hinting at wild cherry, cola and molasses. It's subtle, but convincing.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25894,Praxis 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"There's an impact of treacly grenadine-strawberry on the nose of this wine that suggests full-bodied ripeness, but on the palate it underwhelms in light, diluted flavor and texture. The finish is short.",25.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
25941,Hug 2009 Rancho Ontiveros Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Big, rich and sappy, this tastes like cherry and raspberry jam that has been boiled down and made into wine—a suggestion of its youth. It is very fine, with keen acidity and a noble structure tinged with minerality. Give it 3–5 years to age.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
25949,Halleck 2008 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tasting rich and vital, this has a wealth of raspberry, cherry and cola flavors to the long, spicy finish.

26012,Scratch 2014 Rosé Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness.",18.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
26025,Cebada 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The palate shows barely ripe raspberry fruit, a touch of grassiness and a spicing of anise seed, proving quite light and vibrant even at four years old.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
26056,Simi 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"A soft, mid-range, medium-bodied Pinot Noir from areas including the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast, it imparts aromas of rosemary and herbes de Provence before delving into a world of tart cherry and cranberry. The finish is smoky.",24.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
26066,Hartley-Ostini 2012 Hitching Post St. Rita's Earth Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The weak nose offers a bit of sour cherry, raspberry and menthol, but just barely. On the palate, there are rounded red fruit flavors and a light earthiness, but again just faint. That said, it does pair nicely with meatloaf or, assuredly, the Hitching Post restaurant's grilled artichoke.",34.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
26088,King Estate 2010 Freedom Hill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Freedom Hill is one of the most-admired vineyards in the Willamette Valley, and this elegant wine does it full justice.

26094,Owen Roe 2010 The Kilmore Pinot Noir,"This delightful bottle opens gracefully with lush aromatics, showing snap and complexity.

26104,Balletto 2011 Winery Block Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.",38.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
26110,Marimar Estate 2012 Método Antiguo Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Whole-cluster fermented, this wine offers complexities of baked plum, raspberry and truffled earth. Generous in oak and structure, it also flashes lavender, rose and black licorice around a core of meaty game. Smooth on the palate, enjoy this wine through 2027.",52.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
26111,Merry Edwards 2012 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy and filled with baking spice, this wine offers floral aromas, bright acidity and flavors of baked strawberry compote steeped in cinnamon. Lush on the palate, as so many of the producer's wines are, it is quite mouthfilling and will take on more nuance with time, through 2022.",57.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
26121,Colene Clemens 2012 Victoria Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Still tightly wound, this brings cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center. There's a hint of yeasty bread dough also, and the wine seems to still be emerging from its raw youth. Let it breathe, and a nice streak of deep, dark chocolate fills in the finish.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
26126,WildAire 2012 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"In the world of rare, single-vineyard Oregon Pinots, this is a relative bargain. The vineyard adjoins the St. Innocent winery, in a prime Eola-Amity location. The fruit delivers the subtle complexity and detail you hope for but don't always find in single-vineyard bottles. Brambly and floral with subtle notes of violets, rose petals, cured meat, orange rind and more, it's a dense and thought-provoking wine that rewards close attention.",45.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
26128,J. Christopher 2012 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A tribute to a famous gypsy jazz tune, the name means “clouds” in French. It's an elegant wine with ample acidity and sleek fruit flavors of raspberry and strawberry. A dusting of pumice coats the fruit, giving it grip and texture. The balance to age gracefully is immediately evident. Drink 2017–2025 for maximum enjoyment.",39.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
26129,Love & Squalor 2011 Antsy Pants Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The proprietary name indicates that this is the winemaker's reserve cuvée, a three-barrel selection mixing equal proportions of grapes from the Eola Hills, Dundee Hills and Ribbon Ridge AVAs. It's austere, tight and yet authoritative, showing compact wild berry fruit, Mediterranean herbs and a slight saltiness. It's best to cellar it until 2020, or give it a good long decant.",36.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
26139,Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",42.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
26147,Hanzell 2010 Sessions Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),"This wine is very young and needs time to come together.

26156,De Loach 2010 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Right out of the bottle, this single vineyard Pinot is rich. The flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, are delicious and direct. You can certainly drink it now, but the acid-tannin balance suggests the wine will develop and improve over the next 5–6 years.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
26176,Windrun 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This accessibly priced wine shows soy, black tea, boysenberry, black pepper, baked plums and lavender notes on the nose.

26178,White Oak 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Blue fruit stars in this juicily exuberant wine that shows upfront citrus, red cherry and a spark of campfire-like smoke. Its bristling acidity is balanced in a core of backbone-building tannin that gives it weight and depth.",35.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
26193,Husch 2009 Knoll Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Showing lots more depth and focus than Husch's regular Pinot Noir, this wine comes from nearly 40-year-old grapes grown on the estate.

26211,Cristom 2009 Eileen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This begins as a hard, tight wine with hints of rose petal around a core of blackberry hard candy. The balance is superb, and the wine is lively with nuanced, dark notes blending smoke, espresso and bitter chocolate. An intriguing animal scent surfaces after some hours of breathing.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
26214,Lemelson 2009 Jerome Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Once again the Jerome Reserve delivers the goods—a fine core of ripe cherry fruit, wrapped in pretty new oak.

26216,Siduri 2010 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape.

26258,Flying Goat Cellars 2010 Kate's Cuvee Rio Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Norm Yost named this wine after his wife. It shows rich, deep and mysterious aromas, from dried rose petals and cherries to funky mushrooms, fresh-cut sagebrush, maple and damp wood. It's very full once sipped, with a mushroom ragu element cut by red cherries, orange peels, cranberries and a forest floor finish. This Pinot could handle a big steak.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
26261,Calera 2012 Ryan Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"The nose on this wine is both subtle and deep, showing dried rose petals, cherry kirsch, black currants and a hint of elderberry. It's silky once sipped, with licorice, mocha and dark raspberry all set against tart cherry-skin tannins that give plenty of structure for aging. Drink 2018–2028.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413

26268,Siduri 2013 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Winemaker Adam Lee goes big on this bottling from the vineyard planted by the two Garys (Pisoni and Franscioni), showing bacon fat, blackberries and graphite on the nose.

26269,Three Sticks 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This powerful Pinot is not for the meek or easily afraid. It's a heavyweight in its prime, stemmy and unabashedly full-throttled in juicy Bing cherry, blackberry and raspberry.

26270,Loring Wine Company 2013 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Brian Loring makes this spicy wine from a vineyard in the hills overlooking Highway 101 east of Nipomo.

26325,Belle Glos 2008 Clark & Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Tremendously rich and ripe, this Pinot just dazzles the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, bacon and other intense umami flavors.

26345,Gary Farrell 2011 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This low-production Pinot shows off the elegance and balance you expect from this famous vineyard.

26403,Bargetto 2008 Regan Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Too much acidity in this dry wine, making it almost sour.

26421,Henry Estate 2001 Umpqua Cuvee Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Borderline translucent in color, and equally light in the nose. The aromas are of cranberry and chlorine.

26487,Erath 2006 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Erath makes a solid, reliable, all-purpose but somewhat generic Oregon Pinot Noir. This blended wine fills a desperate need for something that can represent good old basic Oregon Pinot Noir. It's accessible and spicy, with clean and tangy red fruits. A bit sharp and acidic, it should improve over the next couple of years as it softens out.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
26493,Viento 2006 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Pinot Noir from Washington? Yes, it's possible, and in this case, exceptional. Don't look for California sweetness and extract here, but you'll find genuine varietal character and perfect ripeness, without the leafy, tomato flavors that can plague parts of Oregon.

26514,Stephen Ross 2009 Stone Corral Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"There's always lots of acidity in Pinots from the Edna Valley, but this one has more than usual, courtesy of the cool vintage.

26577,Kudos 2014 Zena Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Tight and tannic, this single-vineyard offering emphasizes flavors of herb, grass and green leaf. There's a hint of pale, generic red fruit, but it's more in the veggie camp—think rhubarb rather than raspberry. A hint of brown sugar rounds out the finish.",28.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
26620,Lutum 2011 La Rinconada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lutum is a project from Santa Barbara vintner Gavin Chanin. The brand sources fruit from well-known vineyards, in this case Rinconada, situated in a favorable terroir in the southern part of the appellation. The wine is quite pale and the alcohol level is low, giving it great delicacy. But it's potent in raspberry, red currant, spicy red licorice and softened cola flavors. Delicious now, it will age well until at least 2022.",50.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

26649,W.H. Smith 2010 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Veteran vintner Bill Smith delivers solid and often ageworthy Pinot Noirs. With this bottling, he's succeeded again. The well-known Marimar Estate Vineyard has given him superb fruit to work with, and the resulting wine is dry, full bodied and fairly tannic, with deep, brooding cherry, cola, white chocolate and anise flavors. While it's drinkable now, it should gain bottle notes after 2018.",48.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
26652,Chehalem 2010 RR Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Perhaps a bit more time in barrel differentiates this from the equally-good Reserve. This is a smooth, supple, deeply-fruited wine, loaded with layers of black cherry, cola and sandalwood. Milk chocolatey tannins roll through the finish, smooth as silk, lingering and luscious.",69.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
26653,Chehalem 2011 Ridgecrest Vineyards Wind Ridge Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This block selection really works, showing more muscle and meat on its bones than the excellent vineyard-designated bottling.

26660,Sean Minor 2015 Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light and lean on entry, this wine builds up steam and power as it develops in the glass, becoming a robust exploration of rhubarb and cranberry.

26673,Black Ridge 2014 Barn Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This clean if somewhat simple bottling starts with an extremely light and delicate nose of red cherry, rust, sagebrush, thyme and anise.

26718,Lynmar 2013 Freestone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Thick, rich and tightly wound, this cool-climate wine from near the town of the same name is brightly acidic and floral. A mix of rose petal, violet and dried herbes de Provence on the nose echoes on the palate. Bing and dark cherry provide a sultry fruitiness that never dominates over the piquant cardamom spice. Drink now through 2023.",60.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
26719,Lynmar 2013 Quail Hill Vineyard Bliss Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine comes from the coolest pocket of the producer's estate, the last part typically picked. It offers a study in savory tannin development and thickness, the skins unable to soften gently in the cold. Earthy clove defines the flavor, along with a leathery meatiness and firm structure. A suggestion of black cherry tries to muddle through. Drink now through 2023.",70.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413

26761,Pino 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This fruity wine brings a mix of strawberry and watermelon, in a smooth and simple format. There's a suggestion of some over-ripe fruit in the mix, so best to drink this chilled down.",20.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
26772,Failla 2013 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Generous, abundant, ripe fruit flavors and a tasty touch of spicy oak make a fine combo in this medium-bodied, plush-textured wine. With repeated sips the fruit flavors taste even more intricate and interesting. The texture firms up nicely due to fine tannins and welcome acidity. While tempting to drink now, this will be best after 2018.",58.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
26779,Senses 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Harmony and balance are the hallmarks of this full-bodied and vibrant wine in which everything seems well woven together.

26827,Davis Family 2013 Horseshoe Bend Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft, silky and made in a delicate style, Horseshoe is all about forested earth, black tea and truffle, a delicate lining of orange peel accented in the background.

26902,Domaine Carneros 2010 Clonal Series Block 405 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This Pinot comes from a small block in the estate vineyard, on the Napa side of Carneros. Right out of the bottle, it's very dry and acidic, marked by fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. All indications point to the cellar, except for a funkiness that may become more pronounced with age. It's risky, but try holding through 2016.",55.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
26922,Foxen 2014 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta.

26925,Domaine Eden 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"While this wine's Mount Eden sister bottling may better stand the test of time, the Domaine Eden is what most people will most like to drink right now, and it's cheaper too. Aromas of dried violets, uncrushed boysenberries and pencil lead make for an ethereal nose that seems to hold secrets one must uncover. Precise tannins on the palate offer floral yet savory flavors of black sesame, nori, violet and mulberry. It's mellow yet mysterious.",35.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
26934,Dehlinger 2013 Champ de Mars Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers.

27045,Furthermore 2008 Bohemian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tasted in October, 2010, this Pinot had a spritziness indicating some instability, making it hard to evaluate. That could calm down eventually, leaving behind a big, flavorful and dry red wine, brimming with berries, cherries and cola.",40.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
27046,Furthermore 2008 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A little too soft, which gives a flat, lifeless quality to the mouthfeel.

Rita Hills),"Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate.

Despite its immediate impact, it falls a bit light in the back end, and does not have quite enough weight to support the thick tannins.",44.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
27743,Fort Ross 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"A saignée-method rosé given three months in neutral French oak, this wine is dark raspberry in color.

28033,Benziger 2008 de Coelo Quintus Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point. However, it seems well able to age, given the balance, and the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and rhubarb fruit. Cellar this fine wine until at least 2014.",69.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
28034,Bruliam 2009 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The high score reflects the wine's potential, because it has been put on the market before it's ready to be opened. Fresh and zippy in acidity, its flavors are of raspberry and cherry pie filling, while sweet, caramelized oak has not yet been integrated. Cellar it for a year or two, even longer. It should be quite a beautiful wine by the end of 2012.",52.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
28042,Potter's Vineyard 2012 Dario Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Sourced from a three-acre vineyard planted in 2001, this smooth and quite pretty Pinot is round and fruity, offering lots of blueberry and raspberry fruit. It's laced together with a tight streak of coffee and toast.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28054,Masút 2012 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Given its high-octane aroma of barrel and petrol, this Pinot is defined by its need to settle down, more disheveled teenager than the groomed adult it surely will become. The bones are there, dark berry fruit and lurking, earthy spice. There's a developing softness to the texture, the aromas still being worked out.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28058,Boedecker Cellars 2011 Athena Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Nicely differentiated from the companion Stewart bottling, this Athena is a sharp and spicy affair, with tight, tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Native yeast fermentation and extended sur-lie aging add some snap to the finish. Try after 2016 for optimum enjoyment.",35.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28061,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Du Docteur Rodgers Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish.",102.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
28066,Shea 2014 Shea Vineyard Homer Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Homer is the winery's top level reserve cuvée.

28067,Big Basin 2014 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Winemaker Bradley Brown manages to capture all of the redwood forest-like spice of this region in his lithe bottlings. This one offers fresh pomegranate and rose petal on the nose, plus woody touches of sandalwood and cedar. Bright acidity kicks off the sip, dropping into pencil shavings, thyme and cola, with dried raspberry fruit that runs from end to end.",48.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
28072,The Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"These are in fact the original Pinot Noir vines planted in the Willamette Valley, back in the mid-1960s. An explosion of sensory detail quickly opens up the wine, with pollen, sandalwood, sassafras and coffee grounds. Those flavors wrap around blackberry, licorice and cola, continuing to expand and explore the far reaches of the palate. Phylloxera may soon eliminate these vines, so don't wait to acquire a bit of history in a bottle.",80.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
28076,Shea 2014 Shea Vineyard Block 7 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"It's no exaggeration to say that the 2014 releases from Shea are the best (as an entire group) in the winery's history. Could be maturing of the vines, along with a textbook perfect vintage, but whatever the reasons, these wines are not to be missed. Floral highlights, potent ripe cherry fruit, a dusting of cocoa powder and myriad layers come together in this irresistible, impeccably balanced block selection.",66.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
28078,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Lois Louise Cote Sud Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers. There is an impressive, almost muddy thickness to the palate, without being sweet or rich at all, showing flavors thyme, dill, mint and lavender against a core of dark red fruit.",82.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
28080,Big Basin 2014 Coast Grade Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ben Lomond Mountain),"This wine is a study of how to make Pinot Noir both extremely light and yet powerfully flavorful. Underripe black raspberry meets with white pepper and dill on the nose. The bright and lively palate dances across the tongue with thyme, rosemary and pine flavors against tart red fruit. It's easy to guzzle.",48.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
28086,Challen 2013 Bentrock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The recent vintages from this Santa Maria-based winery of actress Challen Cates and winemaker Kevin Law are some of the most impressive wines out there. This is dark in the glass, with a rich bouquet of cinnamon-clove foam, black plum pudding and hot pastry. It hits the palate with panache and power, showing allspice, dried ginger and sharp cola notes atop rich black cherry fruit.",65.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
28111,Sanford 2014 La Rinconada Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Exotic aromas of cranberry, plum, sandalwood, myrrh and lavender makes for an elegant entry to this bottling by the winemaking team of Steve Fennell and Laura Roach. Layered flavors of tart cherry and pomegranate are laced throughout by dried herbs, while the tannic structure is firm but not obtrusive. Drink 2018–2034.",70.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28112,Waits-Mast 2014 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"Coming from a singular vineyard along the Mendocino coast, this wine has smoky savory flavors that complement the just-ripe fruit flavors and give a truly maverick but easy-to-enjoy personality. It is medium bodied, velvet textured, and has good structure, fine-grained tannins and enough concentration for a lingering finish.",45.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28113,Aberrant Cellars 2014 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Block B3 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"From the last remaining block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath that's yielding less than 1.5 tons per acre, this is loaded with rose petal and cherry blossom aromas. Delicate and graceful, it offers subtle raspberry, blackberry and cherry fruit. The finish is exceptional, long and complex, with hints of coffee and caramel. Give this wine your full attention and enjoy how long it lingers.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28116,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2015 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Still quite young and showing some grapey fruit flavors, this second vintage release is bursting with purple fruit and chocolate malt flavors.

28119,Fullerton 2015 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"From the biodynamically farmed Momtazi vineyard, this adds layers of herb, pine, compost and forest floor components. Fruit is in the mix but is less prominent, giving way to those complex, earth-driven flavors, with a touch of citrus. It seems to give you more the more you give it your full attention.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28135,Penner-Ash 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This light- to medium-bodied wine delivers well-integrated strawberry preserve flavors, along with hazelnut, malt and milk chocolate highlights. It's smooth and well proportioned, and should drink well through 2023.",65.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413

28187,D.R. Stephens 2015 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Thick, ripe and jammy, this is an explosive wine, broadly rich and rewarding in black-cherry, berry and licorice layers of flavor. Firm, tight tannins offer structure and power, with an intriguing hint of fennel funneling through.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28202,Navarro 2015 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Supple and delicious, this medium-bodied wine is not a blockbuster but has wonderful berry and black-cherry flavors, fine balance and a touch of fine-grained tannin in the texture. Light cinnamon and cedar notes come out with time in the glass and add complexity.",22.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28204,Parmeson 2016 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light copper-pink in color, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of peach and orange flavors that combine to refreshing effect.

28217,Soléna 2013 Guadalupe Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Here is your Pinot if you prefer elegance over power. This delicate wine opens with a heady mix of rose petals, orange and lemon peel and raspberry fruit. The raspberry flavors linger gracefully, buoyed by citrusy acidity. The length is impressive.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28253,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"The winery has sourced this wine from their coastal vineyards, which accounts for its acidity and long hangtime raspberry, persimmon and sour-cherry candy flavors. With a silky texture, it's lovely to drink now.",24.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
28257,Bailiwick 2011 Londer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Wonderfully aromatic in Bing cherry, this is a soft, supple Pinot with an oaky, tannic backbone that's otherwise light in color and body. With just the right hint of rose petal happening, it's pretty, too.",38.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413

28283,E16 2012 Upper Bench Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An unripe mushroom note leaps from the aroma . Once you taste it, it's pretty rich in raspberries, red currants and oak, but that earthy, fungal flavor persists into the finish.",35.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
28311,Michael Pozzan 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Feels harsh in the mouth, mostly because the fruit is too thin to balance out the acids and tannins. It has watery, dry flavors of cola and pomegranates.",19.0,82,1,0.9331578735408413
28341,Windstream 2008 Sarmento Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Fantastically ripe, offering distinctly Californian flavors of black cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. There's a sunburst of acidity for balance. Good now with baked ham, beef enchiladas, grilled salmon.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28345,David Hill 2007 Barrel Select Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Wild berries, cranberries and pungent herbaceousness characterize this Barrel Select Pinot Noir.

28351,Siduri 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,39.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28353,Rainstorm 2011 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"There is a dusty aspect to the aromas and texture of this affordable Pinot Noir. Light berry fruit, lemony  acids, and some pretty spices add extra interest.",17.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
28374,Merry Edwards 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This isn't one of Merry Edwards' single-vineyard Pinots, but who cares? It's a magnificent effort, and a classic expression of Sonoma Coast in a good vintage. The wine is dry and tannic, yet lilting in the mouth, with flavors of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates and mushrooms. It's not an ager, but an elegant, sophisticated Pinot to drink now.",39.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
28376,Patz & Hall 2011 Hyde Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The tannins and acids are pushy on this young Pinot, making it tough to appreciate now despite rich, savory raspberry, persimmon, rose and clove flavors. Give it three or four years in the cellar to let it mellow.",65.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
28387,Coelho 2015 Paciência Coelho Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aged in 30% new French oak, this has brown sugar, cola and root beer notes to back up its black cherry fruit.

28393,Talisman 2014 Jamison Valley Vineyard Destein Estate Pinot Noir (Bennett Valley),"Earthy sage and black licorice invite one into this dark brooding expression of the grape, defined in exotic blackberry, black cherry and smoke.

28395,Walnut City WineWorks 2014 La Cantera Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This wine's black cherry fruit, backed by tart acidity and ample tannins, quickly emerges. Cola and brown spice hints reflect its 15 months aging in 15% new French oak, yet it fades on the midpalate as if recently bottled. As with the Carlton Hill bottling, this should benefit from an additional year or two.",40.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
28400,Brigadoon 2015 Lylee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fine value, this tart young wine opens with cranberry, raspberry and cocoa flavors. It's graceful, flavorful and already drinking well but should continue to give pleasure over the next five years.",23.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
28416,Siduri 2007 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Spicy and succulent, with superripe flavors of melted cherry jam, milk chocolate, raspberry pie filling, cola and pepper spice. Dry, but a little too soft for all that richness.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
28435,Westwood 2015 Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Reduced on the nose, youthfully, the reduction blows away to reveal a fruity landscape of blueberry and blackberry that's ripe yet light. Spritzy acidity freshens a hearty body and supportive oak.",44.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28457,El Lugar 2016 Greengate Ranch & Vineyard Blanc Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The slow-growing trend of white Pinot Noir finally landed on the Central Coast and Coby Parker-Garcia gives it a compelling argument in this bottling. Quite clear in the glass, and maybe the slightest bit pink, this shows crisp and clear aromas of orange blossoms, poached pear, sliced lime and rainy cement. The palate is tightly wound with fresh flavors of honeysuckle and more orange blossom.",30.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28458,En Garde 2014 Gold Ridge Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This is a bright, fully realized wine from the distinctive appellation: soft with an integrated approach to its use of oak. Wild strawberry, cranberry and a threading of dried herb combine effortlessly into a pleasurable whole.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28464,Coeur de Terre 2010 Renelle's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Usually this block is at the top of the offerings from Coeur de Terre, but a leathery aroma and dried-out fruit knock it down in this vintage. Earth, cola, mint, a hint of cherry and a pleasant spiciness are also there, but the saddle leather dominates. Two bottles tasted.",58.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
28473,Tantara 2011 Challen Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Some unripe green notes mark the ripe raspberry and cherry flavors on this Pinot Noir. Otherwise it is a silky, delicate wine, showing Santa Maria Valley charm and acidity.",70.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413

28539,Black Kite 2010 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a big Pinot Noir that's dark, heavy and rich. It tastes like a confection with raspberry and cherry-pie filling, with hints of currants, roasted almonds, milk chocolate and anise. While it's in-your-face now, it should mellow over the next six years.",55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28542,De Loach 2010 Pennachio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is one of the Russian River Valley's bigger, riper Pinots. The rich raspberry and cherry flavors are reminscent of a dessert pastry, yet it's dry, silky and bright in acidity. Gains in the glass as it breathes, so give it a brief decant and drink now–2015.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28547,Masút 2011 Block 13 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),This is a uniquely layered Pinot with concentrated dark-cherry liqueur flavor wrapped in notes of mushroom and dirt. The finish is bright and long-lasting. This one calls for chanterelles sautéed with plenty of olive oil and bacon bits.,55.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
28618,WesMar 2007 Hellenthal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors. Waves of sour red cherry candy and cola flavors wash over the palate, accented with orange zest, cinnamon, Asian spices, anise and sandalwood. Better after 2011 and should develop for 3–5 years after that.",50.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
28645,Elk Cove 2015 Clay Court Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Pommard and Dijon clones planted in 2001 fuel this tasty wine.

28646,Ghost Hill 2014 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This substantial, powerfully styled Pinot Noir is layered with tart, punchy red fruit. That rich core is laced with brown sugar, coffee, caramel and cola streaks. It was aged in 10% new French oak.",42.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
28647,Ghost Hill 2014 Prospector's Reserve Pinot Noir,"Sourced from the estate's Bayliss-Bower vineyard, this reserve is a barrel selection that saw a touch more new oak (17%) than the regular bottling.

28650,Hirsch 2014 West Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate.

28652,Saintsbury 2015 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Earthy in sage and black tea, this wine is lightly layered and seamless in texture, with an underlying minty flavor. Cardamom and cola provide a spiciness that persists along a road of great length and breadth.",36.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413

28673,Woodenhead 2010 Ritchie Vineyard Cinder Cone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Lots of acidity gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy tartness that makes the mouth water. The mouthfeel is light and silky, as you want in a Pinot Noir. It's a fine wine to drink now, with a good decanting, but try cellaring it for 5–6 years to see what kinds of earthy, mushroomy complexities emerge.",65.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28697,Foursight 2012 Charles Vineyard Clone O5 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color.

28702,Provincial Vineyards 2012 Reserve Rêve Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
28705,Silvan Ridge 2012 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short.",36.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
28711,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 La Cantera Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component.

28716,Colene Clemens 2014 Dopp Creek Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A streak of coffee runs dramatically down a tight, snappy core of citrus and berry fruit. Flavors are lightly dusted with pepper, remaining bright and precise through the finish.",50.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28720,Talbott 2015 Kali Hart Pinot Noir (Monterey),"There's a tiny bit of effervescence in this twist-top bottling, which shows light cola, red cherry and pencil shaving notes on the nose.

28734,Stoller 2009 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The mid-14% alcohol gives this wine a solid fruit core, much like a California Pinot. Cherry cola flavors hit the palate immediately, then quickly fall away. Bottle shock maybe, but the wine doesn't show the stuffing of past versions.",25.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
28777,Joseph Phelps 2010 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This shows the power and purity of the winery's coastal Pastorale and Quarter Moon vineyards, in this cool vintage that allowed for long hang time. Although some coastal Pinots were plagued by rot, this one was not, resulting in a wine with delicious raspberry and cherry notes, accented by new French oak. It's very fine, complex and enjoyable now.",55.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28829,Joseph Phelps 2014 Quarter Moon Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From another of the producer's coastal estate sites, this wine is juicy, spicy and leathery—a celebration of fresh wild strawberries and buzzy acidity.

28846,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Great Oak Vineyard Suicide Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is produced in microscopic amounts, the result of sourcing grapes from a notoriously difficult-to-farm site. It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28850,Purple Hands 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Cody Wright sources his fruit from an A-list of Willamette Valley vineyards, and Shea is right at the top. Cloaked in a milk chocolate shell, this sophisticated wine melds blackberry fruit with flavor-extending streaks of cola and caramel. In scent and finish, there is a slight intriguing hint of pine sap.",50.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28852,Tendril 2014 TightRope Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is Tendril's reserve offering, better than ever in 2014. Deeply inscribed flavors of black cherry, cola and espresso come through in a textural, detailed and quite delicious wine. It's the darkest of the winery's Pinots, barrel aged for 16 months and bottle aged for another year prior to release. Toasted nuts, crackers and a dash of salt complete the flavors.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
28883,Schug 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A blend of 8 prime vineyards scattered across the appellation, this is a delicately light, but savory, Pinot Noir, the kind that supports food rather than overshadowing it. The cherry, tea, cola, herb and subtle oak flavors are restrained, leading to a dry, balanced finish.",26.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
28896,I'M 2005 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a light but classy take on Oregon Pinot, with leaf and herb in front of spicy cranberry and sour cherry fruit.

29012,Laelaps 2013 Holstein Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Here's an interesting, single-vineyard, Dundee Hills wine at a price usually reserved for blended Willamette Valley cuvées. Slightly murky and funky, it's the sort of wine you might stumble upon in some cob-webbed, Old World cellar. The primary raspberry and rhubarb tones have a peppery, lightly bitter quality about them.",33.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
29036,Dutton Estate 2014 Thomas Road Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate. Black tea and rose garden dance around highlights of orange and cranberry, the wine tart in mineralogy, as well as full of length and density.",56.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29042,Cottonwood Canyon 2010 Elizabeth's Vista Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Though lightly colored, this is a powerful Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard of Norman Beko. He cold-soaks the fruit and ferments with native yeasts to deliver aromas of raspberry, pine and wet slate. The flavors range from pomegranate to violet to red rose to a fruit punch that lingers a long time thanks to a nice acidic lift.",48.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
29046,Hartley-Ostini 2012 Hitching Post Highliner Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"The Hitching Post team of Frank Ostini and Gray Hartley hit a home run on this Highliner, with a nose that features fried shiitake mushrooms, violet and sizzling balsamic vinegar. It boasts an elegant mouthfeel, with very round and widely expressive fruit, characterized by orange peel, olallieberry and more violet.",44.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
29047,Saintsbury 2011 Cerise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This Pinot is not hiding behind anything. It has lots of natural-tasting fruit aromas and flavors without overt oak. Flavors recall cherry, berry and rhubarb; the wine tastes firm and moderately tannic, and has medium to full body. Beautifully balanced, it should improve through 2018.",54.0,92,1,0.9331578735408413
29073,Duck Pond 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"First taste was excellent, as the wine entered the mouth with round, ripe red fruit and a hint of spice. But it has something off in the finish, and as it sits in the mouth it loses its freshness and leaves a rather sour, gluey impression.",20.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
29099,Rex Hill 2008 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"This is the most complex and detailed of the current single-vineyard Pinots from Rex Hill. English Breakfast tea, cherry liqueur, moist loam, dried leaf and highlights of cinnamon apple pie all contribute to a feminine, elegant, well-crafted wine.",65.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
29101,Artesa 2009 Artisan Series Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Compared to Artesa's three other 2009 Pinot Noirs, this one's the least drinkable at this time. Although it's very extracted in cherry and raspberry fruit, it's jammy-simple, like a spoonful of marmalade, with a scour of acidity. Your best bet is to cellar it for 4–6 years and see what happens, but odds are you won't be disappointed.",75.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
29102,Artesa 2009 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"Delicious drinkability is the hallmark of this Pinot Noir, which comes from the winery's vineyard in the Carneros District.

29112,Cebada 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"A pretty pale pink in color, this bottling is very yeasty, reminiscent of a sparkling wine, also showing sour strawberry, wet stone and orange peel on the nose. The yeast is prominent through the sip, dominating the sharp kumquat and pink-fruit flavors.",32.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
29161,Elkhorn Ridge 2011 Le Terre Foss Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Possessing intensely floral aromatics, this distinctive wine also pulls in Asian spices, specifically curry. The fruit hangs on the light side of the red spectrum, with a dash of cherry candy.",29.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29174,Black Kite 2006 Kite's Rest Vineyard Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Not showing the richness of the fabulous 2005 vintage, but a very nice wine nonetheless.

29186,Springhill Cellars 2006 Mer Vin Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The second release of Springhill's Mer Vin (sea wine) Pinot Noir is fruit-driven, and leaves an impression of sweetness along with the fruit flavors of strawberry jam.

29189,Twin Oaks 2006 Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Made in an immediately appealing style, this dry Pinot has a silky elegance that makes it easy to savor the cherry, currant, cola, pomegranate and pepper flavors. Best now and for a few years.",42.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29212,Twomey 2009 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A solid Pinot Noir, silky and rich in raspberry, cherry and smoky oak flavors. Notable for its silky texture and balancing acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now and over the next few years.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29213,Twomey 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Here's a rich, spicy Pinot Noir for drinking now. Dry and silky, it has plenty of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and rhubarb fruit, with a good application of sweetly toasted oak. Could be a little crisper, which limits ageworthiness.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29217,Clos La Chance 2008 Erwin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"You'll find a nice, silky texture on this Pinot Noir, as well as lush flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet tobacco and dusty baking spices. There's some sharpness all the way through that detracts.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29222,Brandborg 2008 Love Puppets Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Pie cherry and raspberry fruit flavors open, with gentle barrel notes of toast and caramel. Balanced and light, this has a pleasing elegance, though a quick finish suggests a lack of depth.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29230,Santa Barbara Winery 2009 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Here's a pretty Pinot, direct and appealing for its range of fruit. Shows raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, uplifted by bright acidity. Drink it now.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29236,Walt 2013 The Corners Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This big, dense wine is dark in color, with lush, late-picked aromas and flavors and very full body. Its power and oozing fruitiness make quite a contrast with more elegant styles, but there is no denying the appeal of all that jammy blackberry and blackcurrant character.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29237,Wrath 2013 Ex Vite Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus.",38.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29265,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Carlton Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir,"This is solidly anchored in its ripe cherry fruit, a rich mouthful that represents the best of the winery's 2012 lineup of reserve bottlings. Highlights of citrus fruits elevate the acids, and there is a pleasing hint of toast across the full midpalate.",40.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29270,Goodfellow 2012 Bishop Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Sourced from 25-year-old vines, this shows traces of dried leaf, along with tart rhubarb and wild cherry fruit. A light dusting of cinnamon and coffee completes a wine that is balanced throughout, medium in length, and finished with an elegant flair.",38.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29277,Carden 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"At first this is constrained to the point of thinness, then the wine breathes open to reveal tart red berries, dried herbs and lemongrass. A whiff of orange peel adds interest. Though aged 15 months in 60% new French oak, it shows little oak influence in its flavors.",50.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29284,Sojourn 2013 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017.",48.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

29340,Buena Vista 2013 Geza's Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine.

29350,Von Holt 2013 Sonoma Coast Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light, clear and crisp, this extremely light-bodied wine combines fruit from various vineyards and clones, and offers a suggestion of cranberry and pomegranate. Earthy, with an edge of forest and tea, it finishes plainly.",32.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29357,Portlandia 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Light flavors call up notes of toasted cracker and raspberry candy that are pleasant enough, but insubstantial. The addition of 3% Syrah to the blend may have helped to bump up the color, but this remains a rather thin and simple, quaffable wine.",30.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29384,La Fenêtre 2005 Le Bon Climat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A nice Pinot, showing real complexity. Dry and medium-bodied, the wine's acidity is brisk, and highlights flavors of cherries, red currants, pomegranates, cola, Chinese five-spice and Provençal herbs. Might develop for a few years, although it's hard to predict, since it's a new brand.",45.0,89,1,0.9331578735408413
29407,Gary Farrell 2012 Stiling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak.",55.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
29409,Analemma 2012 Oak Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Fermented 50% whole cluster and aged in neutral oak and concrete, this appealing wine offers notes of wild strawberries, brown stems and cigar box. It's fully flavored with a supple feel, with tannins that will benefit from some time in the cellar and a cinnamon-filled finish.",25.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
29429,Twin Oaks 2006 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Far better known for Chardonnay, the Sleepy Hollow vineyard also grows a small amount of Pinot Noir, which it sells to outside wineries. Twin Oaks has done a creditable job in crafting this drily interesting Pinot. Pale in color, it has a light, silky texture, but the flavors are full, suggesting raspberries, cherries, root beer and Asian spices.",49.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
29430,Longoria 2006 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Despite what increasingly looks like a weak vintage, the pedigree of this vineyard shines through, making the best of a bad situation. The wine is nowhere near Longoria's wonderful 2004 and 2005, but shows a classic, silky mouthfeel and enough cherry, currant and clove flavors to satisfy. Drink now.",54.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
29462,Mayro-Murdick 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Light in body, with savory acidity, this Pinot offers plush flavors of raspberry tart, red cherry pie filling, root beer, mocha and cinnamon spice. It's more elegant than complex. Drink now.",36.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29472,Goldeneye 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist.

29474,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2015 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains.",22.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

29540,Manzoni 2015 Pedregal Vineyard Rose of Pinot Noir (San Benito County),"Very deep purple for a rosé, although still transparent, this could be mistaken for a light red wine. That's also true for the aromas that include cherry pie, cola and a light dusting of clove. There is a tangy tension to the sip, then flavors of baked red cherry, pastry crust and more clove. It's rather delicious, but a tad heavy for a pink wine.",23.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29560,Poiema 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Very light and reserved on the nose at first whiff, this wine eventually allows aromas of smoked pork, red cherry and a light dusting to dried herbs to emerge.

29598,"Concannon 2009 Selected Vineyards, Central Coast Pinot Noir (Livermore Valley)","An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food.",10.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
29676,Sokol Blosser 2012 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Different vintages favor different sites, and this Goosepen Block offering, though perfectly made, is not quite as dense the other vintage offerings from Sokol Blosser. A wash of milk chocolate surrounds raspberry and cherry fruit. Smooth and supple, with a streak of cola and red licorice, it fades gently into a finish tinged with flavors of clay.",80.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
29696,Marimar Estate 2012 Doña Margarita Vineyard Mas Cavalls Unfiltered Estate Grown & Bottled Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated.

29725,La Montagne 2012 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Slightly sour orange-cranberry aromas meet with a touch of sagebrush on this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard at the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills.

29727,Davis Family 2012 Horseshoe Bend Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Pretty in violet and rose petals this is a lower-octane Pinot Noir for the winery.

29729,Evening Land 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Smoky, spicy and midweight, this earthy, brooding Pinot maintains layers of minerality amid fresh red berry fruit.

29730,Clos La Chance 2012 Murphy's Choice Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Plum, cinnamon, Chinese five spice, egg nog, strawberry compote and sour cherry team up for a memorable nose.

29731,Fulcrum 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Gap's Crown remains a magical site for Pinot producers and Fulcrum does justice to it, providing a subtle entry of soft oak on the nose before letting it open further into dark, brambly berry and earth.

29781,J. Jacaman 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A little on the sharp, green and minty side, with tart acids framing cherry, black raspberry and smoky wood flavors. A good wine that could use more lushness and richness.",40.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
29803,Silver Mountain 2007 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Too overtly sweet. Some wines like this are super-fruity in cherries and raspberries but finish dry. This one doesn't, despite a scour of acidity. Feels unbalanced. Drink now.",38.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413

29831,Hinman 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors.

Oaky on the back palate it struggles to find itself in the glass, the fruit trying to make its way through the thickness of tannin. Letting the wine air a bit should help.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29844,Chateau St. Jean 2013 Sonoma Estates Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.",25.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29858,The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Original Vines Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes.

29859,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2011 Édition Limitée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A block selection, this most rare offering from DDO has rippingly good aromatics, intense and complex, with dusty, dreamy spices wrapped around a seamless mix of berry, earth and herbal components. The somewhat gritty texture gives it muscle and length, and the overall complexity suggests it can age for up to a quarter century. Drink now through 2035.",85.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
29864,Shea 2012 Shea Vineyard Homer Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Homer is the estate reserve, wood-tank fermented and blended from the winemaker's best barrels. Aromatic and toasty, it takes many hours to open fully, revealing a dense core of ripe cherry fruit wrapped in a mélange of tasty, toasty barrel flavors. Along with the gorgeous fruit comes a cavalcade of chocolate, caramel and buttered nuts. Drink now through 2020.",86.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
29874,Laetitia 2012 La Colline Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This hillside-grown wine is only vineyard-designated in special vintages. The nose is like a delicate pine sap, with elements of spearmint, sweet camphor and anise set against light raspberry juice. It's elegant but energetic, with soy sauce, clove and menthol highlighting the hibiscus and red and purple fruits.",60.0,95,1,0.9331578735408413
29909,Osprey's Dominion 2014 Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island),"While concentrated black-cherry flavors shine brightly, this herbaceous wine suggests a leaner, more savory expression of Long Island Pinot Noir. Bright acidity and firm tannins maintain a taut, tight feel.",40.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
29923,Sketchbook 2014 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),"This dry wine has an appealing fruit character, light spiciness and a firm grip of tannin. It will pair well with roast birds or grilled sausages.",20.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
29955,Chesebro 2011 Cedar Lane Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"The nose on this wine from a very promising appellation for value is very root-vegetable-driven, with aromas of just-cut beets, boiled rhubarb, green and black olives and a hint of strawberry. The palate is earthy and interesting, showing lots of chopped black olive, which may be a turn-off for some expecting a more fruit-driven experience.",23.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29957,Cosa Obra 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"Copper peach and orange in color, this light, dry wine is soft and refreshing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry don't overwhelm on the palate. It finishes crisp and ready for another sip.",18.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
29966,HandCraft 2013 Pinot Noir (California),"A slightly earthy aroma leads to rich, ripe berry and cherry flavors that seem to coat the mouth and linger on the finish. It's medium bodied and almost soft, with little acidity or tannin detectable. All that opulent fruit flavor keeps it pleasing.",12.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
29972,Melrose 2012 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Chunky and fruit forward, this opens with scents of roses and cherries, and cherry fruit is the most striking impression on the palate. There's a light suggestion of leather also, and sharp, finishing acidity.",28.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
29979,Gresser 2012 Vineyard Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Aromatic and forward, this is scented and flavored with macerated red plums and cherries. It remains tough and chewy, showing buttery lactic flavors that have not entirely integrated, with a bitter edge to the finish. More bottle age may help smooth it out.",32.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30011,Left Coast Cellars 2016 White Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though not a blush wine, this has a hint of a tawny color, and a whiff of alcohol reflecting the riper, warmer vintage. The fruit flavors range from Key lime to orangeade.",24.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30013,Lost Canyon 2014 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is an herbal, earthy, delicately layered and silky wine with red cherry and pomegranate characteristics. Medium-bodied, it stays true to its varietal nature by being light on its feet.",45.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30021,Stephen Ross 2015 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Red cherry, white sage, iron and roasted game notes make for classic Central Coast Pinot Noir aromas in this appellation blend from winemaking veteran Stephen Dooley. It's light, fresh and easy to enjoy, with dried cherry and anise flavors and a grippy texture.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30041,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a very pure Pinot Noir. It shows its origins in the silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity, as well as a certain minerality that grounds the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's quite good, but not an ager, so drink soon.",44.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30053,Bailiwick 2010 Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Light and silky, this packs a real punch in complexity, with layers of raspberry, cherry, cola and sweet oak. There's a mushroom-driven earthiness you might call Burgundian. The tightness suggests aging, possibly over the long haul.",44.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
30100,Schug 2013 Heritage Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Spicy earth meets baked plum and cherry in this medium-bodied wine sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo Vineyards.

30102,Two Sisters 2014 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Baked cherry and cranberry fruit kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by then wild thyme and touches of dust and smoke. The palate is light and zesty, with hibiscus and tea flavors along with cranberry fruit and more fresh herbs on the finish.",75.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
30112,Lula 2013 Costa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Spicy, oaky and rich in flavor and texture, this wine tastes of vanilla, butter and ripe red cherries upon first sip, feels soft and easy on the palate. As it opens, more fruit and oaky spice flavors emerge, while firm tannins give it grip.",45.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
30117,Omero 2014 Ribbon Ridge Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This cuvée gets some extra time in 40% new wood, and is bottled unfiltered. Plush blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors, accented with streaks of cola and chocolate, capture your attention. It's a rich tasty forward immediately enjoyable bottle, so go for it now through 2020.",35.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413
30153,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2010 Elton Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Like its stablemates, the Elton bottling has dropped more than a point of alcohol in 2010, and the winery's lineup overall tilts toward the thin and herbal. Here the cranberry fruit shows little charm. There's a spine of iron and a finish amply loaded with flavors of herb and earth.",45.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30160,Torii Mor 2010 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This has a hard shell keeping it closed down, despite hours of airing. Cranberry fruit with a hint of mineral seems to quickly hit a wall and stop short. More bottle age may help to open it up a bit.",55.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30169,Babcock 2011 Déjà Vu Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",60.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30207,Demetria 2014 Cuvée Sandre Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass.",68.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
30210,Ponzi 2014 Abetina Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression.",105.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
30212,King Estate 2014 Domaine Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Domaine is the winery's top Pinot Noir: all-estate grown, from grapes now certified biodynamic. It's an accessible, pretty wine, with rich flavors of pastry fillings—think raspberry scones. It's got a tart, tangy grip and the length and structure to age at least a decade.",70.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30215,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Medici Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish.",48.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30224,Challen 2013 Jasper Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip.",85.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30227,Cherry Pie 2014 Rogers Creek Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Cloudy, pungent and supremely earthy, this wine reveals its delicate acidity over time, bringing balance to its flamboyant fruit. With intense strawberry, orange peel and black tea flavors, it's savory and richly built, finishing on a touch of smoky vanilla.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30236,Torii Mor 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"The black label Torii Mor Pinot is the entry-level wine, clean and fresh with clear varietal character. The fruit flavors are tart and lean, but combined with the bouquet offer elegant details with herb and earthy components. The alcohol is a sensible 13.8% and as the wine breathes open it suggests lightly smoked ham and hints of pepper.",29.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30241,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of Oregon's better Pinot Noir values year after year is this basic bottling from Willamette Valley Vineyards. The 2006 is quite spicy with peppery highlights, and the red fruits are sleek and tart, though not green or thin. The core brings warm, somewhat round fruit flavors of pie cherry, plum, and a hint of toast from 20% new Allier barrels.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30260,Samsara 2008 Las Hermanas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"An exotic Pinot Noir, feral and exciting in its appeal. Wildly complex, with the scents of a summertime walk through a coastal California woodland. Forest floor, mushroom, wild cherries and raspberries, roasted shank bone, licorice, sandalwood—the flavors go on and on, balanced with crisp acidity. So dry; a joy to experience.",44.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413
30276,ZD 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Dry, medium-bodied and tart in acidity, the wine holds raspberry and pomegranate fruit flavors that have an earthiness suggesting dried sage. Doesn't seem like an ager.",50.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30278,Kessler-Haak 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Right now, the wine is tart in acidity and tannic, although the ripe cherry and red currant flavors are obvious and delicious. The oak influence is strong. The wine doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, but it should benefit from cellaring until 2017.",38.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30284,Loring Wine Company 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"The texture on this Pinot is a little rustic, but the fruit is ripe in strawberries and raspberries. And the price, the lowest of Loring's many 2012 Pinot Noirs, makes it a relative bargain. Drink up.",24.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30319,Peltier 2014 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi),Good balance and slightly lean fruit and spice flavors make an agreeable combo in this medium-bodied and nicely tangy wine. Whiffs of cinnamon and earth go with cherry and rhubarb flavors.,10.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30337,Byington 2014 Byington Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Chaparral scrub and hibiscus combine on the rather light and dainty nose.

30346,Wine Spots 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",25.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30351,Patz & Hall 2010 Chenoweth Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Rich, full-bodied and heavy, this is dramatic in its own way. It's certainly ripe and thick, with a flavor of black raspberry jam and a touch of milk chocolate. The high alcohol is suggestive of cherry liqueur. But that's been the Chenoweth Ranch signature for years. Drink now.",58.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30371,Secret House 1998 Doerner Vyd Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Light and bright, a shade darker than a hearty Rhône rosé, this cherry- and strawberry-flavored pacer displays saddle leather and earth notes that provide interest and depth. Fairly high in acidity, and with brisk, lightly peppery tannins, this would be great with cheese or spicy hors d’oeuvres.",30.0,86,1,0.9331578735408413
30374,Benton-Lane 1998 Sunnymount Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"One of the strongest aromas of beets I have smelled in a wine; also some vanilla and cream nuances. Tasty and satisfying, if a bit one-dimensional.",50.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
30377,Amity 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A Pinot in the ultralight style. There’s cranberry and tea qualities, and an almost weightless mouthfeel. No new oak renders it clean and fruity, with plenty of fresh-berry essence. In the end, it’s a lightweight that closes with licorice and anise notes.",20.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
30378,Hauer of the Dauen 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A very light and flowery nose starts the package rolling, followed by light candied raspberry on the palate. Features a smooth texture throughout, with the slightest notes of cherry cough drops and fruit punch. A simple, straightforward wine that goes down easy.",14.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
30379,Bethel Heights 1998 Lewman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Very tight in the nose, with hints of peanuts. A cinnamon nuance provides an exotic edge to the otherwise straightforward, somewhat tart cherry palate. Buttery oak and more tangy cherries dominate the finish.",25.0,85,1,0.9331578735408413
30382,Secret House 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Some youthful minty cherry marks the nose. The palate is heavy on the tangy red fruits: cranberry and raspberry. A clean quaffer and a nice introduction to the world of Oregon Pinot. Has the varietal correctness, but it’s trim as a stick.",22.0,84,1,0.9331578735408413
30389,Beran 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Clove, black-licorice gumdrops, some mint and a meaty quality mark the nose. It’s weighty, with raspberry fruit touched by the taste of tomato. It doesn’t offer a lot of finesse, and the oak is heavy on the end.",28.0,83,1,0.9331578735408413
30390,Firesteed 1998 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Some rosés are darker in color than this flyweight. But the bouquet and palate each pack some punch. Orange-rind and cranberry scents pave the way for the chocolate and black-plum flavors that blanket the thick palate. At the end, though, it lacks the sleekness mandatory for a very good Pinot Noir.",10.0,83,1,0.9331578735408413
30393,Panther Creek 2006 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Lovely scents of blue and black berries open into an excellent wine from this well-known vineyard. Cherry cola and molasses flesh out the midpalate flavors, and the fruit has a brambly quality that is almost like Zinfandel. Expressive and detailed.",42.0,91,1,0.9331578735408413
30420,Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"There's an earthy funkiness to this inexpensive Pinot, made at an unheard-of price point for the area. Dry tannins greet the entry followed up by burly oak and big brambly blackberry and cherry fruit, a touch of herb on the finish.",20.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30421,Iris Vineyards 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Strongly herbal, peppery and showing more than a hint of stem, this raspberry and root-beer style of Pinot hits the palate a bit sharp, and does a quick fade.",24.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30423,Vino Vargas 2012 RIo Ruso Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry.",45.0,87,1,0.9331578735408413
30448,Les Voleurs 2013 Hurst Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This soft, light-bodied wine is on the savory side, a taste of cranberry and rhubarb at its core.

30485,Shea 2013 Homer Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration. It retains its elegance, with scents of lavender, incense and Asian spices leading into bright, intense flavors of cherry and plum. The wine gathers itself in the midpalate, showing that fruit density, and finishes with a lick of chocolate. Drink 2018–2030.",86.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
30488,Élevée Winegrowers 2013 Élevée Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021.",45.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413

30507,Walt 2013 La Brisa Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This is a blend of several marquee vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Martinelli and Widdoes. It comes together nicely in a mix of fig and baked bread, peppered in baking spices and dried herb. Cherry comes through along with subtle hints of violet and rose, before a long, lingering finish ties things in a juicy bow at the end.",40.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30508,Shea 2013 Block 7 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Featuring the Wädenswil clone, this block selection carries a whiff of wintergreen and lavender. That minty lift elevates the palate's pretty cherry fruit. It's a harmonious wine, with perfectly proportioned acids and a faint truffle note as it fades gracefully.",60.0,93,1,0.9331578735408413
30519,Ampelos 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This young wine brims with fresh acidity and primary cherry, blackberry and cola flavors. The complexity is considerable and so is the elegance.

30521,Babcock 2010 Deja Vu Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),"Made in a ripe, rich style, this is a big, fruity wine. It's has a potent black-cherry jam flavor that's simply delicious. Atypical for Pinot Noir, but there's no denying how good it tastes.",60.0,90,1,0.9331578735408413

30596,Peter Cellars 2013 Estate Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Pinkish-gold in color, this is a faint, dry and herbal rosé that's pungent in fuzzy stone fruit such as peach and apricot.

30626,Fritz 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The texture is a bit rough for a Pinot Noir, lacking the silkiness you expect. Instead, you get the briary, brambly mouthfeel of a Zinfandel. But the wine is very flavorful in cherries and red currants. Give it a decant and drink up with grilled beef or lamb.",30.0,88,1,0.9331578735408413
30637,Baker & Brain 2013 Origin Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Plump strawberry and black cherry fruit provide power, but elegance is what carries this bottling, thanks to its well-integrated rose and hibiscus aromas.

30650,Arcadian 2011 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Another Joe Davis wine that's benefited from patience, this bottling offers more mature character than the same vineyard's 2009. Umami touches of soy, shiitake and leather underscore the cherry and raspberry scents on the nose. It has a grippy texture and a subtly presented range of flavors—from dried anise and Christmas spice to elderberry, cranberry and dried plum skin.",65.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
30651,Arista 2014 Toboni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From near Olivet Lane and Pellegrini Vineyard—some of the longest planted sites in the appellation—this red is densely packed with spicy, wild black and red fruit, with a soft underbelly of structure. Earthy mushroom and forest pine give it a savory dimension, through soft, silky waves of texture.",68.0,94,1,0.9331578735408413
