6432,Gloria Ferrer 2003 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",70.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
10021,Koenig Vineyards 2003 Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Idaho),"Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) Merlot (40%) and Cabernet Franc (5%) comprise this red blend from Idaho, named after the winemaker's son. Soft spice and berry on the nose and toast, tobacco and berry on the palate are approachable and pretty.",50.0,84,3,0.9738642274378875
11179,Swedish Hill 2003 Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes),"Enticingly nutty on the nose, with hints of smoke, yeast and apricot kernel, this 2003 vintage bottling from Swedish Hill shows promising signs of development. While fairly aggressive on the attack, it's clean and lemony on the palate, with a softly saline, sea breeze note on the finish.",25.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
11618,Paradise Ridge 2003 Rockpile Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),Smells and tastes vegetal; this is not a successful wine.,32.0,82,3,0.9738642274378875
11627,Yellow Hawk Cellar 2003 Mescolanza di Rosso Riserva Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine doesn't have much going on. It's dried out, chalky in the mouth, stemmy and bitter with green tannins. The fruit is dried out and there is a scent of brett as well.",28.0,82,3,0.9738642274378875
13047,Roederer Estate 2003 L'Ermitage Brut Rosé Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"This is as fine a rosé sparkling wine as has ever been produced in California. Almost 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, vanilla, toast and creamy lees, in the style of Champagne, and is completely dry and very crisp in acidity. Fabulously drinkable now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",70.0,94,3,0.9738642274378875
15585,Ray's Station Vineyards 2003 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads. It shows the ripe, polished cherry, plum, sage, carob and licorice flavors of the finest Merlots, with rich, finely ground tannins, and finishes dry. With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",15.0,87,3,0.9738642274378875
15929,Clos du Lac 2003 Cabernet Franc (Amador County),"At five years of age, this Cab Franc still retains a solid core of sweet, jammy cherry fruit, accented with a sprinkling of black pepper, ground cloves, cinnamon, cocoa and vanilla. It also has a dusty coating of tannins that will fare well with a grilled steak.",16.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
17529,Duckhorn 2003 Merlot (Howell Mountain),"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak.",70.0,94,3,0.9738642274378875
17636,Juslyn Vineyards 2003 Perry's Blend Red (Napa Valley),"A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor. A dry and softly tannic, it floods the mouth with cassis, red currant, blueberry, plum, cocoa and smoky oak flavors.",65.0,88,3,0.9738642274378875
17819,Pessagno 2003 Perelli-Minetti Vineyard Port (San Luis Obispo),"Shows real ruby Port-like character in the sweet, berry-cherry and chocolate flavors and vibrant acidity. The midpalate and finish are a little thin, though, so drink up.",32.0,85,3,0.9738642274378875
23310,Salexis 2003 Merlot (Napa Valley),"With its bone-dry, peppery, black currant and black cherry flavors, this is undeniably a Bordeaux-style wine, but it's all Merlot, not Cabernet, in its broad palate appeal. Despite the sizable tannins, it has an immediacy that makes it pleasurable now with steaks and chops.",36.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
24001,Iron Horse 2003 Joy! Estate Bottled Sparkling (Green Valley),"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",250.0,98,3,0.9738642274378875
29399,Ojai 2003 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"At four-plus years of age, this single-vineyard Syrah still has babyfat flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, red currants, licorice, cola, Asian spice and smoky oak that are fresh and vibrant. It's lovely now, with a rich texture of finely-ground tannins, but should develop additional complexity with another five years in the cellar.",37.0,92,3,0.9738642274378875
30148,Sunfire 2003 I Red (Amador County),"Rough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors.",45.0,81,3,0.9738642274378875
33603,St. Francis 2003 Merlot (Sonoma County),"A Merlot with real elegance. This is fully dry, with firm, furry tannins, showing black cherry and currant flavors that are transforming into dried fruits and sweet leather. Could develop for a few more years.",22.0,87,3,0.9738642274378875
40104,Camaraderie 2003 Merlot (Washington),"This is classic Washington Merlot, with flesh and a full-bodied middle. It offers a generous palate of cherries and berries, trailing into light tannins with a streak of green tea and coffee. The wine is balanced and bright, with lightly lifted aromas and a solid midpalate.",25.0,88,3,0.9738642274378875
43335,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2003 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a pretty late release for such an inexpensive wine, but its hard, reductive shell may be the reason it's been held back for so long. Herbs and spices drift up from the glass, along with peppery raspberry fruit. But overall it's a tough nut to crack, and should be decanted well in advance.",13.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
48643,Gloria Ferrer 2003 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

Sushi will be an ideal companion.",70.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
49083,Arger-Martucci 2003 Odyssey Red (Napa Valley),"At five years, this Bordeaux blend is ruggedly dry and firmly tannic, with a baked or cooked edge to the blackberries. It's not very flattering now, but there's a slim chance it could soften and sweeten with age.",75.0,85,3,0.9738642274378875
51716,Reininger 2003 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"For unknown reasons, Chuck Reininger holds back his Merlots; but Reininger makes real Merlot—96% pure—and it works. It's silky and smooth, chocolaty and showing pleasing nuances of herb and grass. The fruit is light, pretty and perfectly ripe, tasting of strawberry, cherry and pomegranate.",30.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
52150,Hunt Cellars 2003 Destiny Vineyards Rhapsody Reserve Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Soft in structure and very fruity, this Sangiovese shows the variety's classic cherry flavor profile. It also has something like the taste of a granola bar, with dates, currants, roasted nuts and honey. Very tasty, but needs greater acidity.",50.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
55545,J Vineyards & Winery 2003 Late Disgorged Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"A little scouring, but delicious and complex, this has appealing flavors of yeast, lemons, limes and pears. Dry and yeasty, it feels very elegant on the palate.",90.0,91,3,0.9738642274378875
57246,Rocca 2003 Syrah (Yountville),"This wine has been variable, but the '03 shows lots of varietal distinction. It opens with a burst of white pepper-infused blackberry, chocolate, licorice and oak aromas, and turns rich and soft in the mouth, with similar flavors. The smooth tannins make this immediately drinkable.",42.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
57248,Smasne Cellars 2003 Bunk House Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Despite the extra bottle age, it's a very youthful, dense wine. The Malbec is battened down with spicy purple fruit flavors and compact tannins. The balance is acid-driven, and the presence of new oak is muted. Will the tannins soften before the fruit fades? It's worth socking a bottle or two away to find out.",50.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
58145,S. P. Drummer 2003 Blair Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is located between St. Helena and Calistoga, and the blend is just about 50-50 of the two Bordeaux varieties. It's a ripe, fruity, jammy wine with some sharpness in the finish.",48.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
58149,Wattle Creek 2003 Shiraz (Alexander Valley),"The winery seems to be calling this Shiraz, not Syrah, because of the wine's direct simplicity, in the Aussie style. It's a soft, fruity wine, bigtime in cherries and blackberries, made to be immediately drinkable.",28.0,86,3,0.9738642274378875
59070,Merriam 2003 Windacre Merlot (Russian River Valley),"This bottling from Merriam has been all over the board over the years. It seems to do better in a warmer vintage. The 2003 vintage was not a great one in the North Coast, and this wine, while showing some polished flavors, is a bit lean. The cherry and currant flavors have been enriched by 50% new oak. Drink now.",30.0,84,3,0.9738642274378875
61913,Ledson 2003 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Held back, for some reason, for more than six years, this wine is showing beautifully now. Exhibits really fine structure, with firm but soft tannins and good acidity framing blackberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors that are just on the verge of turning complex in the way of old wines. Should continue to evolve in interesting ways over the next 3–5 years.",40.0,94,3,0.9738642274378875
66528,Mazzocco 2003 Matrix Red (Dry Creek Valley),"A Cab-based blend of all five Bordeaux grapes, this wine is a little too ripe. It has a raisiny edge to the black currants and cherries, and some bitterness in the finish.",40.0,84,3,0.9738642274378875
68028,Kendall-Jackson 2003 Stature Red (Napa Valley),"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.",95.0,95,3,0.9738642274378875
69042,Lawrelin 2003 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"That vintage date is not a typo. This winery held onto this wine for over a decade prior to release. After opening with aromas of leather, vanilla, mushroom and wood spice, the palate brings reserved, well-balanced fruit flavors. Drink now.",42.0,90,3,0.9738642274378875
69571,Mumm Napa 2003 DVX Méthode Traditionalle Sparkling (Napa Valley),"A brut-style sparkler, at the age of eight years it's still fresh and crisp, with yeasty flavors of limes, strawberries, vanilla and toast. Feels dry and austere despite a honeyed richness, just what you want in a great sparkling wine. Seems best over the next six years.",55.0,91,3,0.9738642274378875
70812,Sunfire 2003 I Red (Amador County),"Rough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors.",45.0,81,3,0.9738642274378875
73995,Prager 2003 White Port (Napa Valley),"Not too many Port-style wines are made from Chardonnay, as this one is. The residual sugar is 6%, but it's not a very good wine. Tastes cooked or stewed in pineapple, and the high alcohol makes for a burnt feeling.",48.0,83,3,0.9738642274378875
75286,Hunt Cellars 2003 Duets Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Cabernet and Syrah, the wine is dry and bitter, with a grapeskin astringency to the currant, blackberry and tangerine flavors. It wisely holds back on the alcohol and excessive fruitiness that can mar Paso Robles reds. But that astringency lowers the score.",36.0,85,3,0.9738642274378875
76117,Tin Barn 2003 Red (Napa Valley),"Tannicly hard and very dry, this austere wine has herbal flavors with just a bare suggestion of ripe cherries and bitter cherry skins. It's clean, but not showing much opulence, and not likely to age.",34.0,82,3,0.9738642274378875
82245,Paradise Ridge 2003 Garrod Ranch Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"An awkward wine. While it's very ripe, the raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors are simple and jammy, and there's a sweet-sour taste that's accompanied by gritty tannins.",30.0,83,3,0.9738642274378875
84941,Falcor 2003 Le Bijou Red (Napa Valley),"Based on Cabernet Franc, this Bordeaux blend is delicious in flavor, but it's also quite tannic and needs some time in the bottle to come around. It floods the palate with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that have been generously oaked, and finishes dry and balanced. Hold until after 2009.",40.0,89,3,0.9738642274378875
87725,Montevina 2003 Terra d'Oro Syrah (Amador County),"Not many wineries hold back Syrah this long, but it must have been because the wine was so tannic. It's still pretty tannic and dry. But there's enough sweet blackberry, currant and cherry fruit to satisfy, especially with char-broiled beef.",20.0,85,3,0.9738642274378875
90007,Grgich Hills 2003 Yountville Selection Red (Napa Valley),"Grgich has struggled with this uneven bottling over the years, and the 2003 shows the problems that have plagued the wine. It combines sharpness with sugary cherry-berry flavors, making for a sweet and sour taste. There are tannins aplenty, but it doesn't seem like an ager.",135.0,84,3,0.9738642274378875
90146,Veraison 2003 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"Kudos to the winery for holding back this Cab Franc, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec blend until it's had time to turn gently soft and velvety. It's at its peak now, showing a bouquet of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cedar.",65.0,87,3,0.9738642274378875
90812,Juslyn Vineyards 2003 Perry's Blend Red (Napa Valley),"A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor. A dry and softly tannic, it floods the mouth with cassis, red currant, blueberry, plum, cocoa and smoky oak flavors.",65.0,88,3,0.9738642274378875
94304,Matthews 2003 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift. This probably needs another five years to really show all of its complexity.",60.0,93,3,0.9738642274378875
96555,Clendenen 2003 Brico Buon Natale Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley),"One of the best Nebbiolos to ever come from California. The aroma dazzles with notes of tar, licorice, roasted meat, cherries, pepper and cedar. The wine is absolutely dry, with brilliant acidity, and seems to change with each moment in the glass. Just starting to dry out, but still fresh and lively. A remarkable wine at an amazingly affordable price for what you get.",35.0,94,3,0.9738642274378875
99500,Terre Rouge 2003 ROX Monarch Mine Vineyard Roussanne (Sierra Foothills),"Made in an oxidized style like a Sherry from Spain, ROX is meant to be drunk as an apéritif with raw oysters or hard, stinky cheeses and cured meats. An interesting almond-flavored take on Sierra Foothills-grown Roussanne grapes for sure.",20.0,87,3,0.9738642274378875
105145,Martin & Weyrich 2003 Dante Dusi Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is a pretty famous vineyard in Paso and other wineries have made good Zin from it, but this one from Martin & Weyrich tastes as sweet as a dessert pastry, with chocolate fudge, cassis, rum, cola, caramel and peppery spice flavors. But there's something to be said for the intensity and the acidity from these 60-year-old vines.",30.0,85,3,0.9738642274378875
109246,Ferriere Vineyards 2003 Cabernet Franc (Sierra Foothills),"Woody and aromatic of muggy earth, this has a spicy, tannic finish and a big-time structure. Its aromas at first veer on the funky side, but then they swirl into tar and spicy, cinnamon berry.",30.0,88,3,0.9738642274378875
110632,Ferriere Vineyards 2003 Raven Oaks VIneyards Cabernet Franc (Sierra Foothills),"A wine bearing flavors of dark cherry and earth, with bright and silky tannins, and a dusting of cocoa on the finish. This may now be in its prime; drink now.",30.0,87,3,0.9738642274378875
113281,Piedrasassi 2003 Syrah (California),"Released at seven years of age, this Syrah is soft, tannic and dry. It has rich flavors of blackberries and blueberries, and seems far younger than it is. It's interesting and complex, and grows in the glass. Could go for a few more years.",36.0,91,3,0.9738642274378875
947,Irony 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.",16.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
956,Bridgeway 2004 Syrah (Central Coast),"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.",16.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
1042,Whitman Cellars 2004 Narcissa Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.",24.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
1347,Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",75.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
1357,Rubissow 2004 Trompettes Red (Mount Veeder),"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",65.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
2699,Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles),"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",32.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
2847,Murrieta's Well 2004 Meritage (Livermore Valley),"The blend is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The result is a medium-bodied, softly textured red wine with flavors of black cherries, tobacco and vanilla that finishes velvety smooth. Drink now.",30.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
2982,Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District),"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking.",55.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
3138,Hunt Cellars 2004 Maestro Red (Paso Robles),"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best now–2012.",48.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
3296,Ojai 2004 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing.",45.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
3303,Prix 2004 Reserve Melange Red (Napa Valley),"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based. It's made solidly along Napa cult Cab lines, a softly voluptuous wine that's delicious now, and should age well for many years. From Hagafen.",75.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
3947,Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.",30.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
4486,Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley),"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",35.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
5026,Kestrel 2004 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.",22.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
5911,D'Argenzio 2004 Tom Feeney Ranch Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Tastes a bit old and tired for a Zin that's less than 4 years of age, but on the plus side is the light, silky texture and complex flavors of dried berries and red currants, cola, cocoa, anise and black peppercorn.",40.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
6347,Deerfield Ranch 2004 Cuveé Merlot (North Coast),"Like the '03, this Merlot is a little too sweet for comfort, showing sugary cherry flavors that taste like melted jam. It's also very soft and lacks a firm structure.",27.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
6555,Cinnabar 2004 Cabernet Franc (Lodi),"Soft and thick in the mouth, even heavy, with ripe pie-filling flavors of blackberries and cherries that finish sweet.",35.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
6633,Elements of Sonoma 2004 E3 Red (Knights Valley),"A Bordeaux blend made from this high plateau between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Tastes rugged and immature, with bright blackberry, currant and cedar flavors wrapped into tough tannins. Too powerful now. Try after 2010.",42.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
6636,Gary Farrell 2004 Encounter Red (Sonoma County),"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",65.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
6705,Grgich Hills 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.",40.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
6724,Bridgeview 2004 Black Beauty Syrah (Southern Oregon),"The entrance of violets and black cherry is offset by volatility and lingering scents and flavors of nail polish through the wine's mid-palate. It finishes with earthy, rough tannins",20.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
7632,Comtesse Thérèse 2004 Château Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Layers of char, black pepper and briar patch help to build complexity in this dense, concentrated black plum Merlot. There's a touch of green leaf and tomato throughout, but overall, it's a fruit-driven, luscious wine accented with spice and smooth, supple tannins. Aged 24 months in new French oak.",30.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
8272,Rosenthal-Malibu Estate 2004 The Devon Vineyard Merlot (Malibu-Newton Canyon),"An eccentric, but not unlikeable, Merlot, with very ripe, almost baked, black currant flavors that have been well-oaked. Bone-dry, the wine finishes with the taste of exotic Asian spices.",26.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
8282,Surfrider 2004 Red (Malibu-Newton Canyon),"Dry and balanced, this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot has cherry, cassis and smoky oak flavors. It's marked by considerable acidity that gives it a racy sharpness. From Malibu Estate.",29.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
8774,Adastra 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",40.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
8789,JLC 2004 Spofford Station Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",36.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
8832,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2004 O.M.O. Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined.",30.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
8929,Kunde 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.",22.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989

10020,Yellow Hawk Cellar 2004 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Good vineyard sources—Ranch at the End, Chandler Reach and Willow Crest—but the bitter, leathery flavors impact all these wines. Here it's less intrusive than in the Barbera, but it still fouls the finish with bacterial funk. Somewhere in here is some pretty cherry fruit.",19.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989

11619,Unionville 2004 Hunter's Red Reserve Meritage Red (New Jersey),"This Bordeaux blend from New Jersey has appropriate aromas and flavors of dark berry, cedar, tobacco and spice, but it lacks the dimension and muscularity that makes this type of blend memorable. Still, it's a pretty wine and will pair well with numerous meat and fowl dishes.",25.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
11625,Epiphany 2004 Gypsy Red (Santa Barbara County),"Epiphany's varietal '04s weren't very good, so how could this Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah blend be? It's dry, tannic and dull, with thin, barely ripe flavors.",25.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989

11634,Robert Hall 2004 Hall Ranch Meritage (Paso Robles),"Hall struggles with Bordeaux-style wines, and no more so than in this hot vintage. Although the wine is fully dry, it's harsh, with very little fruit, and a hot, tannic finish.",35.0,81,3,0.9733266930026989
12018,Arger-Martucci 2004 Dulcinea Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (California),"This extremely sweet wine tastes of rich, seductive honey.

12020,Arbor Crest 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor.",20.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
12202,Austin Hope 2004 Hope Family Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"The very hot vintage took its toll on this 100% varietal Syrah. While it's nicely dry, with a finely tannic structure, it tastes a bit soft and hot. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a dessicated, raisiny edge. Drink now.",42.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
12205,Hall 2004 Napa River Ranch Merlot (Napa Valley),"This '04 is off a beat from the '03, showing a tiredness that may be a result of the heat. It's soft, with candied blackberry and cherry flavors that finish dry, and is not ageworthy.",50.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
12819,Kendall-Jackson 2004 Stature Red (Napa Valley),"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least.",110.0,96,3,0.9733266930026989
13532,Meyer Family Cellars 2004 Syrah (Mendocino County),"Marked by extreme dryness and tannic astringency, this 100% Syrah might benefit from time in the cellar, although there can be no guarantees with an unknown producer. It has a good core of black currants, black pepper and baker's chocolate. Try after 2009.",30.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989

13988,Rodney Strong 2004 Symmetry Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",55.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989
15078,Wente 2004 Crane Ridge Merlot (Livermore Valley),"This Merlot seems a bit lean, with herbal notes on the nose that give the wine's chocolaty richness a hint of carob instead. Dark cherries and vanilla pick up on that herbal note in the mouth, with the vanilla intensifying on the finish. Drink now.",18.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
15590,Geyser Peak 2004 Reserve Alexandre Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),"Reserve Alexandre is always a really nice, interesting wine, but with recent price increases, consumers should be wary. The '04 shows classic Alexander Valley softness and herbs, along with cherries, blackberries and oak, and it's an elegantly balanced wine. But it doesn't seem to be an ager, as it's a little thin on the finish, so drink now.",56.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
15591,Geyser Peak 2004 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.",19.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
15673,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2004 Cépage Red (Lake County),"Here's a rich, soft, gently approachable red wine for big beef stews and barbecue.

16973,Napa Redwoods Estate 2004 Yates Family Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Mount Veeder),"Softer and gentler than a Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, from one of the best but least known of Napa's mountain appellations, offers a wealth of oak-influenced cherry flavors.

17525,Duckhorn 2004 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now–2010.",85.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989
17580,Mount Palomar 2004 Castelleto Sangiovese (Temecula),"You might mistake this for a young coastal Pinot. It's crisp, light-bodied and silky, with cherry, cola, herb tea and spicy, smoky flavors. If only the wine were dry.",22.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
17597,Pietra Santa 2004 Sangiovese (Cienega Valley),"Except for a taste of cooked grapes, this is a pretty good Sangiovese. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a nice earthiness behind the cherries. But you can taste the burnt berries that just got roasted under the hot sun of this vintage.",15.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
17850,Den Hoed 2004 Marie's View Wallula Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A dated but not outdated blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvedre, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese that brings notes of herbs, green beans, and floral notes.

17877,Madroña 2004 Malbec (El Dorado),"Here's a nice, smooth-drinking red wine that's rich enough to serve with your best fare.

18102,Arbor Crest 2004 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins. There is a green streak but it adds complexity and is not off-putting. This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak.",15.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
18110,Madroña 2004 Reserve Quintet Red (El Dorado),"This blend of all the Bordeaux varieties satisfies for its wealth of well-ripened fruit. It just floods the mouth with the flavors of crushed, perfectly ripe blackberries, black raspberries and wild cherries, picked under the warm summer sun. Oak adds smoky nuances. A good job from Madrona. Drink now.",28.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
18613,Forth 2004 La Rousse Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Easily worth the price for its luxurious texture, fine structure and intricate layers of flavor.

18967,Schramsberg 2004 Extra Brut Sparkling (North Coast),"Extra brut means that this Pinot Noir-based bubbly is drier than Schramsberg's regular brut. Even at the age of more than seven years, it's aggressive in bubbly acidity, with a scoury mouthfeel framing ripe raspberry and lime flavors. Feels austere and hard, but who knows? Could surprise. A gamble if you want to cellar it.",70.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
19084,Matthews 2004 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Because he blends shortly after fermentation, Matt Loso's wines attain a seamless complexity early on; it's a hallmark of the winery. This beautifully crafted Claret has no rough edges; in fact, no edges at all. It is a supple, elegant wine, loaded with fruit flavors that run from berry to cherry to plum, while the oak gently adds spice and toast.",30.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
19085,Northstar 2004 Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Quite roasty-toasty, this is heavily scented with coffee and smoke.

Just 150 cases were made.",40.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
19089,Novelty Hill 2004 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority.",28.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
19284,Fife 2004 L'Attitude 39 Red (Mendocino),"L'Attitude needs a warm vintage to succeed, and it got one in '04. The wine, a blend of Carignane, Syrah and other Rhône reds, is dry and complicated, offering rich, earthy, Provençal herb flavors with fruitier tastes of cherries, blackberries and cola. Notable for balance, elegance and power. Drink now through 2010.",18.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
19292,Château Potelle 2004 VGS Syrah (Mount Veeder),"This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it. Best now (if you like young tannic wines, but please decant) and for at least eight years, as it gradually mellows.",75.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
19783,Trinitas 2004 Old Vine Mataro (Contra Costa County),"You might think this was a big Pinot Noir, like a Santa Lucia Highlands, if you blind-tasted it. It's thick and forward in blackberry, currant and cherry flavors, with a firm tannic structure, and very dry. Shows enough balance to age for up to six years.",25.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
22227,Clos du Lac 2004 Reserve Blend Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"A few words that describe this wine are lusty, brawny, rustic, really ripe, jammy, peppery, smooth and spicy. In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs.",20.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
23290,Three Rivers 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is pure Syrah from a winemaker who makes a number of single-vineyard and blended Syrahs. This dark, sappy, seductive wine has you from the first sniff. Though the fruit is big and briary, winemaker Holly Turner manages to capture the polish and elegance of Washington Syrah in the way the flavors are sculpted together. Veins of tar, chocolate, smoke, black licorice, pepper and tobacco accent the young, tight fruit flavors. This wine definitely needs breathing time to show its stuff.",24.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989

23315,Legacy 2004 Red Wine Red (Alexander Valley),"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is from Jess Jackson-owned vineyards high above Alexander Valley. Made solidly in the modern style, it's very ripe, very soft, and extraordinarily rich in chocolate-infused cassis, cherry, date and violet flavors that are liberally treated with new oak. It's a delicious, seductive wine that should ride out the next 8 years with ease.",70.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
23830,Chandler Reach 2004 Estate Select Syrah (Yakima Valley),"A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke. The extra bottle time (this is the current release) has also helped to smooth out the rough edges. As the estate vineyard ages and the vines mature, these wines are gaining in both strength and detail.",28.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
23831,Chandler Reach 2004 Parris Estate Reserve Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This is definitely one of Washington's best Sangioveses, capturing the astringency and natural acidity of the grape, but filling in the mid-palate with chewy fruit flavors of berry and spicy cranberry. The light herbal characteristics of the vineyard come through, adding details of leaf and herb. Since this is a 2004, it is already showing some development in the bottle and is drinking very well right now.",38.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
24572,Abacela 2004 Umpqua Cuvée Syrah (Southern Oregon),"This lighter, fruit-forward Syrah from Abacela showcases the spicy, peppery side of the grape. These may be younger vines, or simply less ripe than the fruit that went into the other Syrah, but it is still a very attractive wine, with sweet raspberries, black pepper and rock. A fine balance of acid and tannin provides the right structure for near-term drinking.",19.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
25101,Roessler 2004 Wiley Vineyard Riesling (Anderson Valley),"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.",18.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
25172,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Lexington Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Oaky and tannic, this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend feels tough and dry right now, although it does have deep touches of blackberry jam. Might soften and sweeten with some time in the bottle.",45.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
25551,Arger-Martucci 2004 Dulcinea Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (California),"This extremely sweet wine tastes of rich, seductive honey.

25553,Buty 2004 Columbia Rediviva Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 58% Cab-42% Syrah blend is almost jet black, bursting with floral aromas, meaty and just slightly pruney, almost like a super Tuscan. Baking spices (brown sugar, allspice) and pepper add still more flavor interest, along with some lightly herbal influence. It's a distinctive, deep and seemingly quick-maturing wine that should be enjoyed now.",45.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
25819,Bargetto 2004 Zinfandel (Lodi),"Basic country-style Zin, dry and on the harsh side tannin-wise, with some green, mint and dried herb flavors to the brambly wild berry fruit. This is a gulping wine for backyard barbecues.",14.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
28877,Miraflores 2004 Syrah (El Dorado County),"This is quite rich and complex, and while it's not without flaws, it shows tremendous promise for future vintages. The wine is dry and full-bodied, with ripe blackberry, smoky leather, dark chocolate and white pepper flavors. But the best thing is the tannic structure, so fine and dusty, almost Napa-esque in quality.",30.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
29383,JLC 2004 Palette Red Table Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Palette is a sensational value from one of Walla Walla's still-unrecognized superstar vineyards, Spofford Station. This Cab/Merlot blend is saturated with fruit and beautifully crafted. In a difficult year (2004 froze out most Walla Walla vineyards) it is a rare jewel. Hints of compost, earth, mushroom and other herbal elements add interest, and the wine is buoyed with lively acid.",22.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
29422,Altamura 2004 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Altamura has tackled this extremely difficult wine for years. They've settled on a style that's soft and silky, with complex flavors of cherries, dates, plum skins, cocoa and pepper, and the weight of a Pinot Noir.",45.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
29783,Maddalena 2004 Merlot (Paso Robles),"A very nice bottle of wine for the price, this Merlot is soft and generous in fruity flavor.

30407,Madrigal 2004 Sonnet #63 Red (Napa Valley),"There's a good wine in here that wants to get out, but it will take some time. Even though this Bordeaux blend is more than four years old, it's still stiff in tannins, with a dry, withering mouthfeel. But there's a solid core of black currants.

31561,Zaca Mesa 2004 Black Bear Block Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"The wine is certainly dense and layered, showing waves of blackberries and cherries, sweet leather and Asian spice, olive tapenade and beef carpaccio, and sweet, smoky new oak. It's extremely complex, and should develop in the cellar, although not for a long time. Best now through 2010.",55.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
31618,BOND 2004 Vecina Red (Napa Valley),"Forward, rather jammy in blackberry, black raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar, with a dessert pastry richness suggesting macaroons and oatmeal raisin cookies. Incongruous as it sounds, there's also a complementary dusting of dried rosemary, lavender and thyme, like the garrigue scent of a southern Rhône wine. Drinks delicious and smooth, although lacking a touch of the refinement of St. Eden.",210.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
31787,Kunde 2004 Shaw Vineyard Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This has been the source of some good to excellent Zins for Kunde over the years. They say the vines are 125 years old. The wine is dense and layered, with dried briary fruit, sweet black currant, licorice, leather and Asian spice flavors that are wrapped into punchy, somewhat aggressive tannins. The alcohol is very high, but the wine doesn't taste hot or unbalanced.",35.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
32373,Midnight 2004 Mare Nectaris Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine shows the ripe, sweet softness of Paso Robles in a hot vintage.

32442,Helix by Reininger 2004 Pomatia Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In 2004 winemaker Chuck Reininger put the accent on Merlot (45%), filling in the rest with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah. Sweet and sappy, spicy and loaded with chocolate and cherries, it's a real flavor-packing bombshell that is sure to delight.",20.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
32457,Stemilt Creek 2004 Stemilt Hill Red Wine Red (Washington),"This is very well made, smooth and supple. The round, approachable fruit tastes of red currant, red berry, and black olive. There is a flash of heat in the back of the throat, but it offer excellent value. Unfortunately it's very limited—just 99 cases.",20.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
32584,Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after.",75.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989
32798,Clos du Bois 2004 Shiraz (North Coast),"Sharp in acids and hot in cracked peppercorn, this dry Syrah features flavors of coffee, blackberries and dark bitter chocolate. Good with chili or beef tamales.",14.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
32806,Matanzas Creek 2004 Merlot (Bennett Valley),"A bit harsh in acids and sharp tannins, this Merlot offers earthy, herbal cherry and currant flavors, rounded off with smoky oak influences. Drink now.",29.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
33343,Six Prong 2004 Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Six different varieties are included in the blend, which varies from year to year. This is very open and fruity, a good, all-purpose red blend that is ready to drink right now. The palate impression is almost too soft, with a residual flavor of ripe bananas running through the finish.",15.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
33463,Arrowood 2004 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Smooth, polished and ripe, this is a blend of Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley. Those are both warm appellations, and in this warm vintage, the wine is extremely ripe. It brims with chocolate, cassis and licorice flavors. Almost too fruity, this is saved by a dry finish.",42.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
33608,Ledson 2004 Baldoochi Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"There's more than a little residual sugar in this soft, sensual Zin, but the wine handles its sweetness well. It's terrifically ripe in blackberry, mulberry, boysenberry and other rustic berry flavors, with lots of spices and vanilla. Drink now.",36.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
33616,Bishop's Peak 2004 Syrah (Edna Valley),"There's a reason why Syrah is on a roll in America, and it's wines like this that make the case. Soft and juicy, it's a mellow, sensual wine, with a taffeta mouthfeel that carries rich flavors of cherry-pie filling, red licorice and vanilla oak that are delicious and worthy of a second glass.",16.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
35434,Treana 2004 Red (Paso Robles),"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",52.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
35627,Barreto 2004 Vintage Port (Lodi),"Sweet and simple, with milk chocolate, cherry and caramel flavors. Needs greater depth and complexity.",35.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
35639,Covey Run 2004 Quail Series Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This budget-priced Syrah offers hints of why the grape does so well in Washington. It has a bit of peppery bite, some very tart cranberry fruit, crisp acids and a lifted, citrusy finish. Clean and varietal, it's a good everyday effort.",9.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
35716,Koenig Vineyards 2004 Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Red Meritage,"An elegant nose of deep spice and fruit leads on this Meritage from the Snake River Valley of Idaho—an emerging region to watch for interesting reds. The wine offers sturdy red fruit, spice and structure, and seems made for hearty fare like grilled steaks or, if you feel like splurging, a kobe burger.",50.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
35721,Bell 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",30.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
36414,Hunt Cellars 2004 Destiny Vineyards Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Soft and mushy in structure, with sweet, pie-filling flavors of berries that have a baked fruit edge, this Zin tastes like it was a victim of hot overripeness.",75.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
36567,Powers 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Slightly stewed fruit scents suggest cooked prunes, and lead into a pretty hard, tannic red wine. It has leafy, somewhat underripe flavors, lots of tannin and a generic red wine flavor; it could be almost anything.",15.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
36574,Barreto 2004 Tempranillo (Lodi),"Soft, simple and semisweet, this Tempranillo has cherry, raspberry and spice flavors. It can be described as rustic.",17.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989

38009,San Antonio 2004 Heritage Vintage Red Wine Red (Paso Robles),"You can call this blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache a Rhône blend, but it's like nothing that ever came from France. Distinctly Californian in softness and ripeness, it has jammy, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate.",30.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
39364,Sherwood House Vineyards 2004 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Despite intriguing notes of ripe red cherries, menthol and barnyard that peek through, tar and smoke from heavily charred French oak dominate both the nose and palate. There's a pleasant midpalate of black fruit and pepper spice but its brief appearance is overshadowed again by a deep char finish.",25.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
40099,Gundlach Bundschu 2004 Rhinefarm Vineyard Mountain Cuvée Red (Sonoma Valley),"This Bordeaux blend is full-bodied and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, with smoky, oaky notes. Tasted in the winter of 2008, it had a dry, tannic astringency that suggested pairing with rich, marbled meats. Should develop in the bottle through 2012.",24.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
40736,Forgeron 2004 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"Dark, dense and lush with rock, cracked pepper, Bing cherries, streaks of spice and mocha, this nicely aged and softened Merlot is full and open. The fruit is round and generous, the tannins polished, and the flavors wrapped in delicious baking spices.",46.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
41447,Ruston 2004 La Maestra Red (St. Helena),"Not quite as rich and balanced as in past vintages, the 2004 is a bit ordinary in blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are fairly powerful, and the wine, which clocks in at over 15% alcohol, feels hot and peppery.",50.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
43139,Kunde 2004 202 Meritage (Sonoma Valley),"A new bottling from Kunde, and one of their most successful reds ever. A Cabernet-Merlot blend, it shows earthy, tobacco-edged flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, carob, vanilla and cedar. It turns away from the current overripe style in favor of Bordeaux-style balance and elegance. Best now through 2008.",40.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
43143,Hendry 2004 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Celebrates its lusty volume proudly as a big, gutsy Zinfandel that makes no apology for high alcohol and extract. The flavors are huge, of ripe blackberries, loganberries, mulberries, red licorice, figs, black olives, Asian spices and oak, but despite all that, the wine finishes fully dry and balanced. Drink now through 2010.",30.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
43149,Valley of the Moon 2004 Cuvée de la Luna Red (Sonoma County),"Valley of the Moon hasn't raised the price on this Bordeaux blend for years, which makes it a value for the complexity you get. This isn't one of those soft, mushy wines that's all flavor and no structure. Acids and tannins provide the architecture for polished blackberry, black olive and smoky oak flavors that are so appealing.",30.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
43333,Alexandria Nicole 2004 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"From young vines, this has been cofermented with Viognier, and it is a firm—almost hard—and tannic wine, with good grip. Black fruits, pepper and some hints of stone can be found, but it hits a wall of tannins that will require some time in bottle to break down.",25.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
43470,Camaraderie 2004 Grâce Red Red (Washington),"Sourced from what winemaker Don Corson calls “the best of the best”, this five-grape blend is modeled after Chateau St. Jean's Cinq Cépages. It shows a carefully sculpted frame, with rich, dark, smoky tannins chiseled into a tight foundation for the dark currant and black cherry fruit. Notes of pepper and spice add interest to the finish, which carries a hint of minerality.",35.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
43704,Stacked Stone 2004 The Gem Red (Paso Robles),"Vegetal and dry, this Rhône-style blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre doesn't have much going for it.",16.0,80,3,0.9733266930026989
43707,Pietra Santa 2004 Dolcetto (Cienega Valley),"It's been an uphill battle for Pietra Santa with this variety, and the '05 doesn't help matters. The wine is harsh in acids, with modest cherry and herb flavors and an annoyingly astringent finish.",18.0,80,3,0.9733266930026989
45156,Clockspring 2004 Zinfandel (Amador County),"Zinfandels from the large Clockspring vineyard are made by a variety of wineries, and they vary in quality. This one shows very ripe blackberry, cherry, tangerine, cola and date flavors, and is dry. The tannins are intricate, with a jalapeño pepper finish.",9.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
45171,Oriel 2004 Solona Syrah (Napa Valley),"With tough, astringent tannins and crisp acidity, this Syrah is pretty locked down, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It has the generous fruit typical of Napa Valley, with polished black currant, black cherry, pomegranate and orange flavors, but those tannins put a straitjacket on the wine. Could come around in a few years, but it's hard to tell.",75.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
47411,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2004 Lone Redwood Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Classic Sonoma Zinfandel, dry, spicy and elegant, with briary, brambly wild berry, tobacco, leather and pepper flavors. It's dry and rich in dusty tannins, and will hold for a good six years.",26.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
47633,Roederer Estate 2004 L'Ermitage Rosé Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"The winery's top rosé is a Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend. It shows equal parts limes, pears, strawberries and raspberries, reflecting its parentage. What lifts it to greatness is the structure, so refined and creamy, rich in acidity, with a yeasty bitterness. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes it gorgeous to drink now with the finest foods.",70.0,94,3,0.9733266930026989
47702,Bell 2004 Claret Red (Napa Valley),"Off in quality from previous vintages, Bell's '04 Bordeaux blend has a naggingly weedy, chlorophyll edge to the cherry and blackberry flavors. It's not going anywhere in the cellar.",30.0,82,3,0.9733266930026989
49078,Javadi 2004 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"This Sangiovese tastes like the filling from a cherry pie, scooped out from the crust, then sprinkled with anise-flavored liqueur and pepper. That's a good flavor. The sweetness may be from residual sugar, but also from enormously high alcohol, approaching 16%.",36.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
49081,Leonesse Cellars 2004 Signature Selection Merlot (Temecula),"Lots of people will like this wine, but purists will object to the sugary, almost Porty sweetness. It's undeniably rich and focused in cherries, blackberries, raspberries and vanilla-chocolate truffle, with a delicious edge of smoky, vanilla-accented oak. But it's not a dry wine, more like something you'd sip at a cocktail party.",65.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
50607,Stonestreet 2004 Fifth Ridge Red (Alexander Valley),"This is the first release of this new wine from Stonestreet. It's Merlot with some Cabernet, Syrah and Cab Franc. Grown in Jess Jackson's high mountain vineyards, it's rich and soft in black currant, cherry, mocha and smoky oak flavors, with smooth, easy tannins. Best now and through 2010.",35.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
51182,Martin & Weyrich 2004 Il Vecchio Nebbiolo (Paso Robles),"Martin & Weyrich continues to struggle with this difficult variety, just like everyone else who tries it in California. The wine retains its naturally high acids and hard tannins, and the cherry and leather flavors have a Paso-style sweetness that makes the finish sugary.",22.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
51192,Montevina 2004 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Here's your basic Sierra Zin, slightly sweet and rustic, with edgy tannins and minty, green pepper flavors. Riper notes of blackberries, cherries and raspberries help the score.",10.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
51201,Collier Falls 2004 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Very high alcohol in this superripe wine shows in a hot, chili pepper feeling and in the impression of sweetness. Both combine to give the berry-cherry flavors a rustic quality.",30.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
51203,Renwood 2004 Syrah (Amador County),"Too sweet for balance, with sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam. The sweetness accentuates the tannins, making them more astringent and rustic than they really are.",25.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
51710,Trinitas 2004 Bigalow Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"Here's a dry, very tannic young Zin, with exotic flavors of wild berries, pomegranates, plums, dark unsweetened chocolate, nutmeg, Chinese five-spice and tobacco, and the list could go on and on. Totally distinctive, it seems to capture a taste of its place. The vines are said to be 120 years old.",28.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
51713,Stemilt Creek 2004 Cabernet Franc (Washington),"This is the highlight of an excellent lineup from Stemilt Creek. It brings the same smooth, round fruit forward flavors as the other wines, but adds in more details with citrus, olive and green tea flavors streaking through. The finish gets downright sexy, with a strong wash of chocolate and caramel. It's made for immediate enjoyment rather than cellaring.",28.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
52418,Roza Ridge 2004 Syrah (Rattlesnake Hills),"Cherry soda, cherry candy; however you define it, this has a sweet cherry character. Light and fruity, it does offer some black pepper and loam character as well, elevating it above the level of simple soda pop wine.",15.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
52433,Laetitia 2004 Cuvée M Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is the best of Laetitia's current sparklers. It's the smoothest and finest in texture, with a mouthfeel that's all silk and satin. The flavors, of raspberries, limes, smoky vanilla and yeast, are similar to the winery's other bottlings, but the fine smoothness shoots the point score up. Now through 2012.",35.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
52669,Morrison Lane 2004 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Warm, sharp (15.3% alcohol) and spicy, this Roussanne has a lot of bite in the mouthfeel. Sharp, edgy citrus rind flavors lead quickly into a finish that also has a bitter edge, a bit like quinine or gin. But served chilled on a warm day, it makes a fine apéritif.",22.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
53508,Gloria Ferrer 2004 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Sonoma County),"A good, rich bubbly, elegant and easy to drink, with a scoury texture framing flavors of limes, brioche and vanilla. Drink now.",24.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
53518,Parducci 2004 True Grit Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",25.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
53535,Ferrari-Carano 2004 Prevail West Face Red (Alexander Valley),"A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.",55.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
54201,Ursa 2004 Vineyard Blend Petite Sirah (California),"Pretty good for a Petite Sirah with a statewide appellation. Satisfies for its lush array of flavors and for the way the sturdy tannins and brisk acidity provide a fine framework of balance. Blackberries, cherries, leather, olive tapenade, grilled beef, tamari and white pepper are just a few of the flavors.",16.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
54406,M2 2004 Soucie Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This wine has a ridiculous alcohol of 16.3%, which makes it prickly, and the dryness makes it taste even hotter, since there's no sugar to balance and soften. It's got extremely ripe blackberry-pie flavors. Be careful if you drink this; a little goes a long way.",22.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
54415,Fralich 2004 Harry's Cuvée Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Syrah and Zinfandel, this is a sharp, Porty wine with flavors of raisins and caramelized blackberries. It's semisweet and sharp on the finish.",42.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
56000,Calcareous 2004 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Very ripe, almost like the berry-cherry filling from a pastry, this Zin also has notes of chocolate and sweet roasted coconut. It's rough and ready in the mouth, with jagged tannins, and needs meats and cheeses to balance it.",26.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
57251,Alexandria Nicole 2004 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is thick and spicy, a raging bull of a wine that skates along the border of Napa Cabernet country. As this Horse Heaven Hills vineyard matures, it is becoming clear that it can deliver the big, broad and deep flavors that put Washington Merlot at the front of the class. What's especially nice about this blend is its intense bouquet of blackberry, spicy anise and cedar. For all of its power this retains its balance, its acidic spine and even a touch of grace.",24.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
57257,Benessere 2004 Costa del Sol Red (Napa Valley),"This affordable blend of Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Merlot is a serious red wine. Showing layers of blackberries, mocha, herbs, spices and smoke, with a complex acid-tannin structure that will stand up well alongside dry reds costing much more.",15.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
57267,Beaulieu Vineyard 2004 Dulcet Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Napa Valley),"As the name implies, it's a soft, gentle wine. Quality has varied over the years. The '04 is one of the better vintages, a complex but accessible wine with polished black currant, dark- chocolate truffle and anise liqueur flavors. Drink now and through 2010.",40.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
58150,Jessie's Grove 2004 Westwind Zinfandel (Lodi),"Velvety-smooth in texture, with well-articulated blackberry jam, cherry, cassis and melted dark chocolate flavors, this Zin is a little too dessert-like and Porty for my palate. But lots of people will love this richly superripe style.",24.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
58152,Falcor 2004 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"From grapes in the Russian River and Dry Creek valleys, this Zin, which has a fine, complex tannic structure, shows a raisiny, sweet edge that was a result of the searing vintage. Overripe fruit gives a taste of sugared blackberry juice.",34.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
58569,Hendry 2004 Block 24 Primitivo (Napa Valley),"This wine wears its 15.8% alcohol better than any similarly heady wine out there. Yes, it's a bit hot, but the heat comes across as a slight chili pepper edge to the blackberry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors, and the wine is, in its own way, balanced and elegant. Hard to imagine a more perfect barbecue red.",31.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
60019,Quintessa 2004 Red (Rutherford),"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward.",125.0,95,3,0.9733266930026989
61241,Twisted Oak 2004 Syrah (Calaveras County),"Not quite up there with the wonderful 2003, probably due to the hot vintage, which made it a little soft and overripe, but it's a very good wine. Shows black currant, mu shu plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, clove and pepper flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. At its best now and for a year or two.",24.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
62979,Russian Hill 2004 Ellen's Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"There's a deep, ultraripe core of cherry and blackberry fruit to this wine that's almost shriveled. You can sense that hint of raisins in the finish, which is very dry and on the astringently tannic side. It's a nicely fashionable wine, but not an ager, so drink now.",30.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
62980,Toad Hall 2004 Bodacious Red (Napa Valley),"This is Toad Hall's Meritage-style Bordeaux blend, 50-50 Cab and Merlot, and while it doesn't have much depth, it appeals instantly for a rich array of flavors. Cherries, blackberries, cassis, mocha, mushu plum sauce—all of it slightly sweetened, but tannic enough to qualify as dry. Drink now for its youthful babyfat.",40.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
62988,Burgess 2004 Syrah (Napa Valley),"There's a touch of raisiny overripeness in this dry Syrah, not a lot, but just enough to confuse the palate. Other than that, the wine is as smooth as can be, with a chocolate and bitter cherry finish.",22.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
63554,Ilsley 2004 Seis Primas Red (Stags Leap District),"An unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, with a splash of Merlot, this is a beautiful wine. It's also a young one, brimming with tight, youthful tannins that give it a lockdown astringency. But the cassis, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors are impressively deep and complex, and should ride out six to eight years of cellaring.",45.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
63694,Abacela 2004 Syrah (Southern Oregon),"This blend of Umpqua and Applegate Valley fruit, cofermented with 2% Viognier, is crisp and varietal, with mixed berries, peppercorns and cured meats all vying for your attention. Seamless and balanced, it keeps the alcohol down around 14.3%, which keeps the integrated structure intact. Silky tannins carry a whiff of roasted coffee through the finish.",30.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
65387,Glen Fiona 2004 Basket Press Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In 2004 new winemaker William Ammons began at Glen Fiona, and this is the first of his wines to be released. This is spicy with pepper and herb, both in the nose and in the mouth. The fruit is quite tart and tastes of rhubarb and cranberry.",30.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
65389,Valley of the Moon 2004 Syrah (Sonoma County),"There's value for the money in this smooth wine. It smacks of cherries, not the darker, deeper fruits of Syrah, but it does have a complex leathery, meaty edge. The tannin-acid balance is just right, and leads to a simple, fruity finish.",16.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
65390,St. Francis 2004 Reserve Pagani Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This is a Zin for lovers of big, ripe to overripe, tannic, high-alcohol interpretations of the variety.

65398,Barreto 2004 Touriga Nacional (Lodi),"Made from one of the classic Port varieties, this dry wine shows the possibilities of growing these grapes in a hot California climate.

66455,Barra 2004 Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Sweet and rich in fruit and smoky oak, with thick tannins and the rustic mouthfeel of a youthful Petite Sirah. The flavors are of jammy blackberries, cherries, leather, coffee and black pepper. Should age for a long time without necessarily gaining elegance.",22.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
66535,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Gist Ranch Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Tastes a little sweet, which may be from the extremely high (15.4%) alcohol. There's a soft, sugary mouthfeel to the pie-filling cherry and oak flavors. Firm tannins round out the picture. Not an ager.",48.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
66537,Clos du Lac 2004 Syrah (Amador County),"Here's a dry, somewhat brawny wine that has some charm. It's filled with briary, peppery flavors, with fruits suggesting blackberries and cassis. Good value in an inexpensive steak and chops wine.",12.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
66539,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Very high alcohol (15.5%) mars this otherwise good wine, giving it a hot, peppery feeling and making it unbalanced. Dry and tannic, it has fully ripe flavors of black cherries, cassis, cocoa and oak.",32.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
67798,Bargetto 2004 La Vita Regan Vineyards Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Minty, with easy wintergreen, cherry and sandalwood flavors framed in stiff tannins. This blend of Dolcetto, Refosco and Nebbiolo needs rich beef dishes.",60.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
68030,Rubicon Estate 2004 RC Reserve Syrah (Rutherford),"Best known for their red Bordeaux blend, Rubicon also produces small quantities of this Syrah, grown on the Rutherford estate. The wine is spectacular and immensely satisfying. Thoroughly dry, its tannins are front and center, but they are very finely ground, and frame enormously complex flavors of cassis, cherry jam, grilled meat, sweet leather, lavender, crushed pepper, smoky vanilla and cinnamon spice. Drink this fabulous wine now and through 2010.",62.0,94,3,0.9733266930026989
68299,Adelaida 2004 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Shows the cooked, stewed fruit of a Paso Zin grown in a very hot vintage plagued by heat waves.

69558,Rubissow 2004 Merlot (Mount Veeder),"Hard and dry in tannins, this Merlot has cherry and red currant flavors. It's properly clean, but the astringency is really tough, and the wine seems unlikely to age through it.",50.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
69559,Leonesse Cellars 2004 Syrah (Temecula),"The winery's single-vineyard bottling, released a few months earlier, was much better. This regional bottling is simple and rustic. The blackberries and currants are rich, but there's a stubborn undertow of asparagus.",32.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
70559,David Fulton 2004 Petite Sirah (St. Helena),"Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy.",45.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989

70821,Spann Vineyards 2004 Mo Zin Red (Sonoma County),"Tastes like orange, apricot and cherry sweet-and-sour sauce you get in a Chinese restaurant over pork or chicken. The flavors are of those fruits, with some white sugar and rice vinegar.",20.0,80,3,0.9733266930026989
70853,Bogle 2004 Phantom Old Vine Red (California),"This blend of Zin, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is sort of old fashioned, a dark, full-bodied wine whose berry fruitiness has an earthy, balsamic vinegar edge. It's tannic and slightly sweet.",17.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989

72943,Eagles Landing 2004 Syrah (Edna Valley),"Coming from cool Edna Valley, the acidity is here, even in this hot vintage, and so is the clean, long hangtime fruit. The wine bursts with blackberries, cherries, plums and wilder notes of unidentified forest berries and sweet, smoky leather. Drink now, for its complex, juicy youthfulness.",25.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
73987,Fanucchi 2004 Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This is a hot, sweet Zinfandel, with an alcohol level of 15.4%. It's very ripe and forward in jammy cherry-berry fruit, with a spicy edge of cola and mocha. It contains some Petite Sirah and Alicante, like an old-fashioned field blend.",45.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
73991,Falcor 2004 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Falcor's previous Sangioveses both seemed underripe. This one's just the opposite, a soft, jammy wine with sweetened cherry and raspberry candy flavors.",32.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
73992,Clayhouse 2004 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Brawny and fruity, this wine has a hot mouthfeel from high alcohol, accentuating the tannins. The blackberry and cherry flavors taste stewed. But the finish is dry.",23.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
73993,Fralich 2004 Harry's Red Passion Syrah (Paso Robles),"Harry's passion evidently is for sweet, soft, simple wines, to judge by this one. Almost totally devoid of balancing crispness and vitality, it has syrupy flavors of blackberry jam and melted chocolate.",36.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
74653,Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"Don't even think about opening this brut for at least six years and probably far longer. Made from 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Noir, it's rich and full-bodied, with elaborately ripe flavors of tangerines, raspberries, roasted almonds and coconut, brioche, honey and vanilla. Good as it is, it simply needs time for everything to transmute into magic.",100.0,96,3,0.9733266930026989
74958,Williamson Wines 2004 Amour Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich. It is, in black cherries, black currants, mocha and oak, but it remains a tough, hard wine despite being nearly six years old. Not going anywhere.",45.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
76478,VJB 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"VJB's estate Syrah, from Sonoma Valley, is vintage variable, and 2004 was kind to it. The grapes got quite ripe, so the wine, which is slightly hot, shows lush flavors of black and red currants, dates and figs, chocolate macaroons, anisette and peppery spices. Yet it maintains a balancing backbone of acids.",45.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
76489,Stemilt Creek 2004 Merlot (Washington),"This delicious wine is as soft, silky and supple as can be. The fruit is slathered in spicy, chocolaty oak, which lends some sharpness to the edges. Red berries and red licorice lead into finishing flavors of baking chocolate. But as tasty as it is when first opened, it fades quickly, suggesting that this is one to drink up rather than lay down.",20.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
76490,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Camel Hill Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fogarty has a good track record with this bottling. The '04 certainly is ripe and soft, with rich, jammy cherry, red currant, raspberry, licorice and mocha flavors. With very high (15.5%) alcohol, it could have a firmer structure, but it's lip-smackingly good.",48.0,89,3,0.9733266930026989
77225,Ursa 2004 Petite Sirah (El Dorado),"Fans of this variety will find something really interesting here. While the wine has the bigtime wild berry, chocolate, leather and spice flavors that Petite Sirah so dependably produces, it also boasts alcohol below 14%, giving it welcome balance. With thick, furry tannins, it's a guaranteed ager, if you like your Pets old.",22.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
77226,Used Automobile Parts 2004 Red (Napa Valley),"The question is whether or not this wine will age, for it sure is tannic. Burns from entry to exit, and it's not the alcohol, which is modest. It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins. Give it until sometime in 2008, and it should drink well for an additional six years.",50.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
77240,Hartwell 2004 Merlot (Stags Leap District),"This 100% Merlot is soft and fleshy, with a raw meat note to the cherry, violet and smoky vanilla flavors. Feels considerably lighter than a Cab, but still important. Good with roast prime rib, which Cabernet would swamp.",65.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
79169,Bonterra 2004 The McNab Red (Mendocino),"This Merlot, Cab and Petite Sirah blend sneaked into a very upscale Napa Cabernet tasting, and it acquitted itself very well. Dry and firm in tannins, it shows a high level of refinement, not to mention ageability. With black currant, plum, pepper and dark chocolate flavors, it's fine now and should hold and blossom for 6–8 years.",45.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
79522,Truchard 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"Very ripe, even superripe, with pie-filling currant, cherry and plum flavors that approach raisin. With its soft texture and smooth tannins, the wine is voluptuous. Drink now.",28.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
79528,Arger-Martucci 2004 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Soft, peppery and a little on the sweet side, this Cab Franc has upfront flavors of cherry preserves. Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now.",65.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
79578,Renaissance 2004 Mediterranean Red (Sierra Foothills),"Fruity and direct, this Rhône-style blend has flavors of cherries, red currants, chocolate, herbs and spices. It's very soft and fairly sweet. Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah.",30.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
80938,Beringer 2004 Alluvium Red Table Wine Red (Knights Valley),"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",30.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
81399,Villa Mt. Eden 2004 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Napa-Amador),"This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price.",16.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
81417,Brian Carter Cellars 2004 L'Etalon Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux blend is a powerful, dark, earthy wine, scented with Bordeaux-like forest floor, herb and fungus. It's the sort of Cabernet that is not afraid of the grape's true varietal character, and promises to age beautifully. Right now it would need some considerable airing to show its best, but the compact and intriguing finish, with its panorama of earth, green and black tea, spice and cassis, is well worth the wait.",30.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989

81912,Camaraderie 2004 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"This is a very nicely rendered Wahluke Slope AVA Syrah, with spicy currant and raspberry fruit underscored with the characteristic lightly citrusy acids. There's a hint of pineapple which resonates just beneath the surface. The wine gathers some strength in the back, adding weight and flavors of plum, cherry and chocolate.",28.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
81992,Stonehedge 2004 Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Big and bold, this is classic coastal Petite Sirah. It's dark in color, robust in texture and massive in blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and anise flavors that taste like they've been baked into a pie. Dry, crisp and balanced, it will be delicious with a charbroiled steak.",25.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
82236,Martin Ray 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"The '04 is considerably better than the '03, probably because the warmer vintage ripened the fruit and did away with the minty greenness. No unripeness here. It's all deliciously jammy blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit, with an sweet, oaky finish.",20.0,84,3,0.9733266930026989
82241,Pianetta 2004 Syrah (Monterey),"This superripe wine is a blast of blackberry, cherry and blueberry fruit, puréed in the blender and then sprinkled with a dusting of cocoa and white pepper. But it's too sweet by far, and too soft, lacking the structure for balance.",28.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
82242,St. Francis 2004 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"With ripe cherry-berry and tobacco-spice flavors, this is a bit hot in alcohol and rustic in astringent tannins. But give it the right greasy food, such as barbecue ribs, and it will rise to the occasion.",22.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
82247,Constant 2004 Syrah (Northern Sonoma),"This wine is soft both in acidity and tannins, and simple and semisweet, with sugared raspberry tea and cola flavors, and isn't going anywhere.",65.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
82250,St. Francis 2004 Syrah (Sonoma County),"A good wine in many respects, but it has dry, astringent tannins that make it feel harsh and sticky. The cherry and blackberry flavors are ripe and somewhat medicinal.",19.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
82255,Sterling 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A harshly tannic wine; while there's a good hit of cherries, it's so tannic that it will never soften out.",22.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
83138,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2004 Artist Series Meritage Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply.",48.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
83139,Domaine Carneros 2004 Brut Sparkling (Carneros),"The vintage was a very ripe one, and the heat shows. It's very forward, almost jammy, in sweet strawberry and peach flavors. This robs the wine of some elegance and finesse, but it's still an attractive sipper.",25.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
83148,428 Wines 2004 Boulevard Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Competent winemaking has delivered a pleasant, simple red, which has a little bit of a spicy kick from the Syrah.

83149,Barreto 2004 Vinho Tinto Red (California),"A blend of Tempranillo, Tannat, Touriga and Souzao, this gentle wine appeals for its raspberry and spice flavors. It's also quite crisp, making it a good partner for roasted meats.",18.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
83764,A to Z 2004 Night & Day Red Wine Red (Oregon),"From the Del Rio and Abacela Vineyards, A to Z's 2004 Night & Day is mostly Merlot, Cabs Franc and Sauvignon, with smaller percentages of Syrah, Dolcetto, Petit Verdot, Nebbiolo and Tempranillo. Unlike many such mutt wines, this has a definite structure, a focused mix of black fruits annotated with pepper, slate, iron, cocoa and pencil shavings. It was 100% barrel-aged with a small percentage of new wood.",20.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
83931,Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"An awesome rosé, just a tremendous feat. Made from 11 vineyards in 4 counties, it shows a masterful art of the blend. Insanely rich in toasted bread and lees, showing the influence of six years in the bottle. A tremendous core of strawberries, raspberries, orange zest, roasted macadamia, roasted coconut, pear liqueur and honey lasts into the finish. Despite the richness, the wine is dry. So lovely now you can hardly keep your hands off, but it should age gracefully for the next 10–15 years.",130.0,98,3,0.9733266930026989
83946,Coniglio 2004 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Soft and melted, like liquid chocolate infused with blackberry and cherry purée sprinkled with cinnamon and a dash of pepper.

86602,Valley View 2004 Anna Maria Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Not sure why a five-year-old Syrah is being released in the spring of 2009, but it remains reasonably fresh. The primary fruit is fading, and the excessive, toasty, smoky barrel flavors tend to bury the subtleties that age may have provided. This is simple, peppery, and absolutely ready to drink right now.",24.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
86619,Gloria Ferrer 2004 Royal Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Carneros),"A beautiful sparkling wine, rich and refined in the mouth, with creamy flavors that show ripe, sweet California strawberries and limes. This bottling gets better and better with each new release.",32.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
87716,Renwood 2004 Grandmere Zinfandel (Amador County),"If this wine had greater acidity for crispness, it would be near perfect, but as it stands, it's too soft. Too bad, because the flavors, of blackberries, cassis, chocolate, anise, mint and smoky vanilla, are totally delicious. The flabbiness is cause for concern.",30.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989
89012,Fenestra 2004 Silvaspoons Vineyard Port (Lodi),"Made from native Portuguese grapes, this Lodi-sourced Port-style wine has a strong, sweet nose of big-time ripe cherry and blackberry with a hint of meat, almost jamón.

89195,Mumm Napa 2004 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's highest quality wine, named in honor of their late winemaker, Guy Devaux, who brought a Champagne sensibility to the brand. At the age of eight years, it's softly complex and delicious in lime, raspberry, yeasty brioche and vanilla flavors. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes a fine sparkling wine so special.",65.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
89751,Clos du Lac 2004 Potter Vineyard Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"If you like you Zinfandels very spicy and peppery, with a briary, rustic nature, this is for you.

90016,Casa Rondeña Winery 2004 Cabernet Franc (New Mexico),"A very appealing nose of bright cherry and spice is followed by flavors of tea, spice and red berry in the mouth. Good body and tannins and a lingering finish make it a unique choice from a somewhat unknown region.",20.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
90137,River Star 2004 Merlot (Paso Robles),"I like this Merlot for its plush fruit and soft balance. It's bigtime in chocolate-infused blackberries, plums and cherries, with more exotic notes of Asian spices. Yet the finish is totally dry, and the tannins are rich and ripe. Seems at its best now.",25.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
90138,River Star 2004 Syrah (Paso Robles),"The dryness hits you first, then the tannins. This is a Syrah that's hard and astringent, almost aggressive. But then the core of blackberries and cherries kicks in, turning spicy and licorice-like on the finish. Suddenly, the wine is interesting. One to watch, if the winemaker can manage those bigtime tannins.",30.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
90150,Ferrari-Carano 2004 Merlot (Sonoma County),"The winery did a nice job with this high production (19,000 cases) Merlot, which was assembled from various parts of the county. The wine is dry and spicy, with scoury tannins that frame cherry, tobacco, thyme and dill flavors. Drink now.",25.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
90659,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2004 Trenton Estate Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Tons of jammy fruit in this softly tannic, easy-to-drink wine.

90833,Work 2004 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in an exotic style, this Zin is ultra-concentrated in fruit and rich in tannins, in the way of a Howell Mountain red wine. It's complex in spicy currants, Dr. Pepper, Tabasco, chocolate and anise. A little soft in acidity, but should mellow out for years.",29.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989

93203,Grgich Hills 2004 Miljenko's Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This suffers from major problems. It has all the faults of a hot Zinfandel: semisweet baked-fruit flavors, a lack of acidity, and a resulting medicinal quality.",69.0,80,3,0.9733266930026989
93215,Big Ass 2004 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a seriously good Zinfandel, both for what it is and what it isn't. It's dry, grippy in dusty tannins and complex, with earthy flavors of coffee, cherries, tobacco, blackberries and Asian spices. What it is not is overly alcoholic and sweet, as so many Zins are. The alcohol is a modest 13.9%. The wine has true balance and finesse, and is a great buy in Sonoma Zin.",15.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
94299,Lawrelin 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A full 13 years old, the aromas are still vibrant, with notes of cranberry sauce, leather, vanilla and baking spice.

96428,Corliss Estates 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blackberry, blueberry pie and plum fruit flavors are nicely welded to smooth barrel flavors that bring in coffee, licorice, toasted walnuts and mocha. This is definitely a fruit and barrel wine, thoroughly delicious but without the funk or minerality of Walla Walla Syrahs.",55.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
96540,Zaca Mesa 2004 Z Three Red Wine Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A southern Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is stylish and elegant, with a smooth, silky texture.

97194,Airlie 2004 Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),"It's a little late to be releasing an '04, but this may actually be all the better for the extra bottle age. Richly scented with rose petal soap, chewing gum and lychee, it delivers concentrated, oily flavors with a sharply floral streak. It's bone dry and highly extracted, and tips the scale at 14.4% alcohol.",10.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
97538,Trentadue 2004 La Storia Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley),"This is a classic coastal California Petite Sirah.

Bone dry, it will live for many years.",28.0,88,3,0.9733266930026989
100822,Flora Springs 2004 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"A blend of the two Cabernets and Merlot, the '04 Trilogy shows the wine's traditional elegance.

100825,Markham 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A few years in the bottle have nicely mellowed this wine, giving it a soft, smooth mouthfeel.

101015,Merryvale 2004 Profile Red (Napa Valley),"Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now. Should hit its stride around 2010 and continue to develop for some years after. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",125.0,94,3,0.9733266930026989

101918,Brian Carter Cellars 2004 Solesce Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a barrel selection, from those lots determined by winemaker Brian Carter to offer more aging potential.

101919,Camaraderie 2004 Cabernet Franc (Washington),"This elegant Cabernet Franc is drinking beautifully, just beginning to round out the hardness of youth. The wine has a firm and confident backbone, which seems to wrap the acids and tannins tightly together. The framework supports the crisp, clean, immaculately ripe fruit, with flavors of plum, cherry and red licorice. Just 25% new oak was used, adding a light toasty touch to the finish.",23.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
101925,Page Cellars 2004 Limited Edition Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"This has good, clean, ripe fruit with some mass and muscle, and the flavors go deep rather than broad.

102500,Prager 2004 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This dark red wine shows the brawniness and tannic hardness of a young Petite Sirah. It's bone dry and relatively modest in alcohol, but it lacks the richness and depth of flavor to enable it to age.",38.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989
102846,Pacific Ridge 2004 Grace Red (Napa Valley),"This is a Merlot-Cabernet blend from St. Helena and Oakville. It's pretty good, dry and rich in black currants, cherries and oak.

102848,Falcor 2004 Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is quite a good Syrah that impresses all the way through. The first sniff is of a burst of white pepper, while the first sip assaults the palate, in a good way, with ripe blackberry, plum, mulberry and roasted meat flavors, and a sprinkling of cloves and anise. It's an upscale wine, but softness will limit ageability, so drink now through 2008.",32.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
102859,Leonesse Cellars 2004 Vista del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula),"Deeply flavored, this impressive Syrah advances the red wine cause in Temecula. It's a big, powerful wine, rich in blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, with a peppery, chocolate, anise and grilled meat finish. Really fine now, but also packed with young, astringent tannins, it's a wine to decant, or cellar for up to five years.",44.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
103628,Ferrari-Carano 2004 Trésor Red (Sonoma County),"It has been some years since I last tasted this proprietary Bordeaux blend, and it's nice to see it's a very good wine. A little hard and unresolved now, it shows a wealth of oak-infused blackberry, cherry, olive and cocoa flavors, and an acid-tannin balance that will help it age. Best 2008–2010 or so.",55.0,90,3,0.9733266930026989
103637,Whitehall Lane 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Pretty nice Merlot, soft and sensual, like Merlot is supposed to be, and wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, plum, chocolate, cedar, vanilla and spice flavors.

103647,Sterling 2004 Three Palm Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"ound, lush and a bit warm, this is a velvety-textured Merlot with fruit characters that border on dried black cherry and plum rather than fresh fruit.

105132,Robert Craig 2004 Syrah (Central Coast),"Craig has struggled to move this Paso Robles Syrah off-center and into the end zone for years. The fight continues.

105134,Peachy Canyon 2004 Para Siempre Red (Paso Robles),"Smooth and ripe, this Bordeaux blend pleases for its rich array of blackberry, cherry and spicy plum flavors. The texture is soft and chocolaty. Loses a point or two for the sugary finish, though. Drink now.",40.0,85,3,0.9733266930026989

106337,Chandler Reach 2004 Parris Estate Reserve Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% Cab Franc, and Chandler Reach has a particular talent with this grape. This is almost jet black, saturated with color, and it goes deep with sweet, ripe black cherry and black olive flavors. The dark stuff is balanced by fresh acid, well-modulated tannins and a finish with pleasing texture and balance. It's muscular, herbal and smooth, with hints of coffee in the finish. Tastes even better after being open for 24 hours.",38.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
106828,MacRostie 2004 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Shows the integrity of previous bottlings, but without the concentration or Northern Rhône-like quality of the last several vintages.

107145,Matriarch 2004 Red (Napa Valley),"This lower end wine from Harlan's stable is as good as most Napa wineries' best. It's beautiful to drink right now, showing class and distinction.

107146,Northstar 2004 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In the blend of this intensely fragrant young wine is 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. I like the complexity, the way the primary fruits mix in unusual notes of pineapple along with the black cherry. It's resonant and tangy, with good, long flavors and lots of new oak. This was a year of winemaker transition, and may be the last of the real chocolaty wines from Northstar. Give this plenty of airing, or cellar it for another 3–4 years.",41.0,92,3,0.9733266930026989
108096,Silverado 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Silverado's Merlot has been variable over the years. This '04 is fruit-driven, a soft, direct and appealing wine for its wealth of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate and leather flavors. Could develop bottle complexities with some time in the cellar.",32.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
108554,Kynsi 2004 Bien Nacido Vineyard ZB Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"The wine is a serious Syrah that further establishes Kynsi's mastery of this variety, which is so hard to make into a complex wine. Drily tannic, it shows a fabulous range of flavors, among them blackberries, black cherries, chocolate-covered mints, licorice candy and plum jam, and even lighter, pastry notes of pecan sandy cookies. Might age for a while, but probably at its best now.",46.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
108558,Ballentine 2004 Block 9 Reserve Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Better known for Cabernet, Ballentine brings a deft hand to their Block 9 Zin, which has earned high scores for years. The vineyard is in Calistoga, and the warmth has coaxed out intricate flavors of wild red and black berries and cherries, mocha, herbs and spices, with a distinct black pepper note. The tannins are thick, but very fine. Among the top Napa Zins, this wine will age for a decade or longer.",29.0,93,3,0.9733266930026989
109021,Ballentine 2004 Pocai Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"An interesting Merlot that shows a huge improvement over the '02 and '03, possibly because the vintage was warmer and the fruit got ripe. The winery still has work to do on this bottling, but the '04 is tannic and rich, and shows the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors you want in an ultrapremium Merlot.",24.0,87,3,0.9733266930026989
109499,Barreto 2004 Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"There's a good streak of acidity behind this dry wine, which is fortunate because the tannins are very soft. It has just enough crispness to balance the ripe cherry and sweet green herb flavors. Similar to Sangiovese, this is a pleasant sipper now.",24.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
109500,Lost River 2004 Wallula Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side. It's a wine that could go in a positive direction with cellar time, but it is impossible to tell right now, as it cuts off quickly once in the mouth.",22.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
109513,Bargetto 2004 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Starts off a little musty, so decant for a while, and this coastal mountain Merlot will open up to reveal mint-accented blackberry, blueberry, cocoa and clove flavors. It's rich and polished, but a little on the soft side. Drink now.",24.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
111209,La Sirena 2004 Barrett Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"From Heidi Barrett's estate vineyard in Calistoga, this Syrah is very rich and appealing. What it lacks in complex subtlety it makes up for in immediate chocolate-inspired blackberry jam and mushu plum flavors. Firmly tannic, it might age for a while, but will show best now through 2012.",80.0,91,3,0.9733266930026989
111324,Ledson 2004 Cabernet Franc (Alexander Valley),"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices.

113592,Van Ruiten 2004 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Rich in the flavors of blackberry, cherry, raspberry and blueberry, this dry wine has a rustic texture. Even though the official alcohol is 14.5%, it tastes a little prickly.",18.0,86,3,0.9733266930026989
113596,Mettler Family Vineyards 2004 Petite Sirah (Lodi),"This very dry Petite Sirah has a wealth of cherry, cola, mulberry and spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins and acids.

114041,Kenneth Volk 2004 El Pomar Junction Vineyard Merlot (Paso Robles),"A bit unbalanced, this Merlot has raisin, bitter chocolate, cherry and mint flavors. It's fully dry, but feels harsh and sharp, lacking the voluptuous texture you want in a Merlot.",28.0,83,3,0.9733266930026989

2462,J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity.

6666,Glenora 2002 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not.

Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices.",10.0,86,3,0.9705251822000759
9631,Mumm Napa 2002 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"DVX is Mumm Napa's top of the line vintage bottling. This '02 is a 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, making it a brut. It's very high in acidity, and the bubbles are tiny and refined, giving it the ultra-smooth mouthfeel you want in a superior sparkling wine. The raspberry, lime and pear flavors are rich, but subtle, reined in by yeastiness and a tangy minerality. Drink this luxurious bubbly now and over the next 10 years.",55.0,94,3,0.9705251822000759

22860,Silver Thread 2002 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Although the aromas are sweet, oozing with pear nectar, stone fruit, dried spices and apple blossoms, this wine features only 1.5% residual sugar. It's fairly big for a Finger Lakes Riesling, with a slightly oily texture, and comes across as being close to dry thanks to firm acids on the finish. The only problem with this wine is its limited availability.",13.0,90,3,0.9705251822000759
25939,Sparkling Pointe 2002 Brut Séduction Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Aged eight years prior to disgorgement, then again in the bottle, the Brut Séduction is a testament to how utterly delicious aged sparkling wine can be.

33606,St. Francis 2002 Claret Red (Sonoma County),"At five years, the wine still retains some charm, but is showing its age.

56229,Silvan Ridge 2002 Early Muscat - Semi Sparkling Muscat (Oregon),"This Beaver State answer to Moscato d'Asti is sweet, sweet and more sweet. Who knows what the actual residual sugar reading is? That said, the lemon-lime aromas with notes of basil and tarragon are nice, and the wine is currently quite fresh (although it likely won't last long). Not too bubbly or aggressive, and pretty in the mouth due to fairly snappy acids. Drink now with fruit-based desserts or frosted cake.",14.0,85,3,0.9705251822000759

56288,Trentadue 2002 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dark and intense in spicy blackberry, cherry, cocoa and earthy flavors with a hint of bitter espresso. The rich but smooth tannins and crisp acidity of this ripe wine cry out for beef or lamb.",18.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
56294,Eaglepoint Ranch 2002 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"After all the soft red wines lately, it's almost a relief to gag on some real tannins. Dry and spicy, with big-time black cherry pie flavors, complete with the baked, buttery crust.",24.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
60000,Raphael 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011.",25.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
69516,Maddalena 2002 Riesling (Monterey),"Full bodied and viscous on the palate, the wine is balanced by bright acidity that gives it good focus. Peach, grapefruit, apple and spice notes are at the core here, followed by a lemony fresh finish. Quite fruity in style and fairly sweet. Try it as an aperitif or with duck and sweet sauces.",10.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
69520,Hunt Country Vineyards 2002 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This wine starts slowly, but a little bit of air really loosens it up, yielding aromas of vegetable oil, apples, and spring flowers. In the mouth, it's light in body yet crisply flavored, with Granny Smiths dominating. Enough floral elements persist on the palate to provide moderate complexity.",10.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
69521,Handley 2002 Riesling (Mendocino),"A totally refreshing blend of citrus, apple, peach and pear flavors, all couched in bright textured acidity.

69531,Logan Ridge 2002 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish.",9.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
70072,Lawrelin 2002 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This project aimed to show how well Washington wines can age and the proof is in the bottle. Aromas are complex, with notes of dried cranberry, cherry, leather, black tea, cocoa and mushroom. The palate is packed with rich fruit flavors that show no signs of slowing down. It flat-out impresses.",42.0,93,3,0.9705251822000759
72445,Chateau St. Jean 2002 Johannisberg Riesling (Sonoma County),"Despite 12.4% alcohol, this wine still has a healthy dose of residual sugar. The fat mouthfeel and sweet fruit flavors scream California, from the ripe apple and peach flavors to the squeeze of lemony acidity on the finish.",15.0,87,3,0.9705251822000759
74405,Red Newt Cellars 2002 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Comes close to a Germanic style, with tight, lean citrusy aromas and flavors balanced by green apples and pears.

76244,Summit Lake 2002 Clair Riley's Pirate Reserve Port Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A fine vintage Port-style wine, rich in chocolate-infused cassis flavors. Feels softly plush and velvety, and is very sweet. Nice way to end a meal with a chocolate dessert.",45.0,92,3,0.9705251822000759
81525,Hunt Cellars 2002 Sweet Serenade Tawny Syrah Port Syrah (Paso Robles),"Rich and fine in the mouth, with cherry and currant preserves, chocolate and tangerine zest flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins.

101692,Iron Horse 2002 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),"The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",38.0,95,3,0.9705251822000759
102001,Glenora 2002 Brut  (Finger Lakes),"The nose on this upstate New York sparkler is promising, with toasty aromas reminiscent of Champagne. However, the palate doesn't follow through. The wine is thin and watery, with little depth or persistence. Nonetheless, it could be enjoyable as a simple warm-weather quaffer.",25.0,81,3,0.9705251822000759
111332,Iron Horse 2002 Russian Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"For those who like their sparkling wines a little sweet. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend has the highest dose of residual sugar of all Iron Horse's bubblies, and it shows in the jellied flavors of raspberries, strawberries and limes. Very crisp acidity provides needed balance and elegance.",31.0,88,3,0.9705251822000759
111867,Arrowood 2002 Saralee's Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley),"A lovely and delicate wine, absolutely refreshing, and a versatile companion at the table.

112734,Bully Hill 2002 Riesling (New York),"A simple, sweet quaff that's surprisingly good, from a winery known more for their wines from French-American hybrids. The peach and superripe apple flavors show a clean, crystalline quality to the fruit.",9.0,86,3,0.9705251822000759
114309,Ferrari-Carano 2002 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"Fruit's a bit thin, tending to tart green apples, grapefruit and lime, and oak plays a leading role, lending notes of smoke and vanilla and a creamy texture. Very well structured. You find yourself wishing there was more depth of flavor.",15.0,85,3,0.9705251822000759
165,Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",25.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
210,Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley),"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",18.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
221,Falcor 2005 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",34.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
360,Vinavanti 2005 Le Bon Viveur Red (California),"Dry and acidic, this light-bodied wine has tart flavors of mashed cherries, cherryskins, orange zest and citrus fruits. It's a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Sangiovese. Nice with pizza with prosciutto and olives.",15.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
361,Vino V 2005 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins.",45.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
1047,Gemella 2005 L'Anima Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle.

1126,Erba 2005 Mountainside Vineyards Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
1130,Sol Duc 2005 Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard Meritage Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
1131,Horan Estates 2005 HVH Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
1242,Chaddsford 2005 Syrah (Pennsylvania),"Intriguing all around, this displays earthy notes of truffle and meat on the nose, and balanced flavors of full raspberry and spicy caramel on the palate. Though a touch angular, the wine has elegance and good fruit.",28.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
1247,Montevina 2005 Terra d'Oro Syrah (Amador County),"More tannic, drier and more acidic than most fine coastal Syrahs, this one from the Sierra Foothills is marked by its firm structure.The black currant, licorice, beef jerky and tobacco flavors are complex. Best now.",18.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
1356,Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles),"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",34.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
2057,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 119 Meritage (Alexander Valley),"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",15.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
2092,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",30.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
2382,Alba 2005 Dry Riesling (New Jersey),"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat though—and need more dimension.",13.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
2387,Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",55.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
2388,Mazzocco 2005 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",27.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
2391,Four Vines 2005 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County),"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness.",24.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
2392,Four Vines 2005 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (California),"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",14.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
2438,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
2663,Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada),"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",75.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
2684,Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County),"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",13.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
2695,Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",26.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
2696,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",35.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
2700,Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",18.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
2846,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat.",28.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
2848,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Switchback Red Red (Washington),"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",25.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
2850,Whitman Cellars 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
2852,Helix by Reininger 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.",22.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
2971,Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",32.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
2981,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",34.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
2986,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California),"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",20.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
3299,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",60.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
3304,Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
3547,Manzanita Creek 2005 Carreras Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.",38.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
3591,X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
3597,Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
3598,Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley),"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",32.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
4343,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",22.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
4346,Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
4347,Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",24.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
4350,Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
4495,Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
5021,Rosenblum 2005 Rominger Vineyard Syrah (Yolo County),"It's pure Rosenblum, as sweet as a confection, as delicious as a filling made from blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla and white sugar. It's impossible not to be impressed and troubled by a wine such as this.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
5029,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Sangiovese (Red Mountain),"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",25.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
5045,Sparkling Pointe 2005 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Beatifully pétillant with small, persistent beads, this hints of tangerine and lemons skins against a backdrop of fresh mushrooms and madacamia nuts. The foam is quite mouthfilling, but lemony acidity leads to a lingering finish.",42.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
5064,Nickel & Nickel 2005 Suscol Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",55.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
5067,Karly 2005 Sadie Upton Zinfandel (Amador County),"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",29.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
5071,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Pousseur Syrah (Central Coast),"Here's a bone-dry, powerful young Syrah that's packed with hard tannins. The vineyard sourcing is interesting, ranging from the Sierra Foothills through Paso Robles and the Salinas Valley to the Santa Cruz Mountains. Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now.",18.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
5540,Brassfield 2005 Round Mountain Volcano Zinfandel (High Valley),"This has been a good bottling for Brassfield. It shows classic mountain intensity, with explosive currant, wild berry, mocha, pine cone, anise and pepper flavors, tucked into firm, sweet tannins. Could benefit from 2 or 3 years in the cellar.",22.0,89,3,0.966990360015615

6345,Maryhill 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",20.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
6356,Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",110.0,97,3,0.966990360015615
6549,Martin & Weyrich 2005 Flamenco Rojo Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts. The wine is thinly structured and harsh in tannins, with exaggerratedly sweet cherry, cola and currant flavors.",27.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
6565,La Capilla 2005 Melange Red (Paso Robles),"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",44.0,81,3,0.966990360015615

6631,Valdez 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",38.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
6639,Buena Vista 2005 Merlot (Carneros),"Sharp and tannic, with cherry, blackberry, coffee, cocoa and peppery flavors. Exuberantly rustic now, but could mellow with a year or two in the bottle.",21.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
6704,French Hill 2005 Premium Select Pinotage (Sierra Foothills),"Let's hope this isn't the future of California Pinotage, because the wine smells and tastes Porty, even though the alcohol isn't that high. There's a raisiny, stewed berry element that ends in a dry, harsh finish.",32.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
6714,Vivác Winery 2005 V. Single Vineyard Nebbiolo (New Mexico),"A good balance of berry, spice and fruit recommend this; it has balance and structure and a degree of complexity that will lend it to pairing with heartier dishes. An interesting and fun wine.",20.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
6716,Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Merlot (California),"Sharp and jammy, with blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a simple, direct wine that needs a big, juicy cheeseburger.",12.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
6718,Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania),"The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence. Overall though, it's balanced and friendly, and will pair well with myriad mild-flavored dishes.",17.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
6891,Bonneau 2005 Epos Meritage (Napa Valley),"It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.",60.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
7119,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2005 Little Bear Creek Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This affordable blend of all five Bordeaux grapes is a solid second wine, produced from barrels cut from the winery's other bottlings. It hits 14.5% alcohol but remains reasonably well balanced, with just a touch of heat. It's dark and smoky, with plenty of barrel flavors. Cherry liqueur, smoke, caramel and espresso—it gives you a lot of power for the price.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
7237,Sparkling Pointe 2005 Brut Séduction  (North Fork of Long Island),"Honey and lemon accent the nose and palate of this stately flagship wine from Sparkling Pointe. Extended lees aging lends remarkable depth and complexity—shades of brioche and almond add a richness on the palate. Revitalizing acidity and a train of tiny bubbles lead to a soft, pillowy foam.",60.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
7347,Sunstone 2005 Estate Bottled Reserve Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Stash this in the cellar for a while, because even though it's well over three years old, it's still a big, immature wine. Dry and tannic, it explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola, licorice, orange zest and pepper flavors, wrapped into sweet, smoky oak. The parts should begin to come together by the end of 2009.",58.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
7621,Comtesse Thérèse 2005 First Harvest Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"After the scent of char blows off a bit, this first harvest Merlot opens sweetly to aromas of vanilla, cinnamon spice and plush, red plums. There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.",18.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
7633,EOS 2005 Cupa Grandis Grand Barrel Reserve Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"As sharp, fresh and fruity as a jar of raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, melted into liquid and fortified with alcohol. Feels hot, too, despite an official alcohol reading of just 14%. The winery held this back for five years, an expensive investment in storage, but the wine just can't quite overcome its limitations.",60.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
7810,Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Rancho Bello Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Bring on the cheeseburgers!

7994,Paul Dolan 2005 Deep Red Red (Mendocino),"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
8074,Heron Hill 2005 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Complex layers of slate, chalk and peach open this light-weight Riesling.

8404,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With alcohol at an astounding 16.5%, this Zin tastes hot and peppery. Some high alcohol wines have a fat sweetness that makes them delicious. This one's bone dry, with dried blackberry and cherry flavors that finish with a burn.",40.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
8422,Donati 2005 Merlot (Paicines),"Overly ripe and sugary sweet, this Merlot, with a splash of Cab, has a rustic feeling. There is ripe fruit and fine tannins, but the sweetness is a problem.",25.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
8510,Domaine Carneros 2005 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"A bit rough and scoury around the edges, but dry and crisp and elegantly constructed, with rich flavors of citrus fruits, yeasty baked dough and vanilla. Drink now.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
8788,Dry Creek Vineyard 2005 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun. The wine is impressive in ripe blackberries, currants, licorice and cocoa, but maintains a beautiful structure, with soft, fine tannins and just-in-time acidity.",34.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
8920,Tildio 2005 Profundo Red Wine Red (Wahluke Slope),"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio.",35.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
8931,Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Michele Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",55.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
8936,Camaraderie 2005 Elegánce Meek Vineyard Red Red (Yakima Valley),"Ignore that misplaced accent over the ‘a' and focus on the excellent wine in the bottle. With Cabernet dominating., this wine is sleek and spicy, with a marked impression of graphite and gun metal. Although in general the '05 vintage is tilted more toward the ripe side of the spectrum, this wine retains a lean and elegant precision.",35.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
9703,Meeker 2005 Four Kings Red (Alexander Valley),"Meeker has tinkered with Bordeaux blends for years, and this is their best so far. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's rich and soft, with blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors and interesting notes of sage and sweet dill. Now through 2011.",60.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
9707,Stephen & Walker 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A little soft, but the spices make up for that, creating a tingly mouthfeel of pepper, anise and clove. That's in addition to the ripe wild blackberry, cherry and mulberry flavors, finished with a splash of tabasco. Great with teriyaki beef or pork.",35.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
10006,Château Julien 2005 Private Reserve Syrah (Monterey County),"If you're looking for a soft, sweetish wine, here's one. It has flavors of ripe red and black cherries, currants, dark chocolate, root beer and licorice, and tastes like a fruit and honey energy bar.",36.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10007,Domaine Chandon 2005 Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"This variety is commonly used in Champagne but rarely vinified on its own. This wine shows why. It's like Pinot Noir in the silky texture, but feels jagged and harsh, and the fruit tastes a little baked and sugary.",35.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10008,Fanucchi 2005 Wood Road Vineyard Trousseau Gris (Russian River Valley),"Smells honeyed and tastes like one of those fruity bottled sodas. It's a riot of peaches, pears and vanilla cream, with a honey-sweet finish.",19.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10012,Rosenblum 2005 Snows Lake Vineyard Zinfandel (Lake County),"This is a wine that's soft in structure, and while it's dry, it's hard in tannins and the fruit has a baked taste like shrivelled raisins. Not an ager.",35.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10015,Vie Winery 2005 L'Imaginaire Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Not a whole lot going on in this soft, simple wine. The cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors are ultraripe, with a liqueured quality, and the finish is semisweet.",39.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10016,Vivác Winery 2005 Divino Red (New Mexico),"This unique red blend from New Mexico has a nose of candied spice and a smooth but structured character of red berry, spice and a touch of sweetness. It's not terribly complex but the flavors are good and the overall impression appealing.",22.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10018,Rosenblum 2005 Monte Rosso Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"From the pitch-black color you can tell this is an enormously extracted wine. It shows the stuffing of this famous vineyard's Zins, with blackberries, loganberries, cherries, licorice, leather and cocoa-laced coffee, and is quite tannic. But it's diminished by what tastes like notable sugar in the finish, even though the alcohol is over 15%.",45.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
10911,DiStefano 2005 15th Anniversary Ottimo Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hot and volatile, showing some browning around the edges, with chocolaty/pruney aromas.

11497,Corley 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend, which this year contains a bit of Syrah, seems to vary vintage to vintage. The '05 is based on Cabernet Franc. It shows a fine structure and is very dry and tannic, but needs time to soften. However, the oak-infused black cherry, black currant, violet and anise flavors are impressive. Best after 2010.",55.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
11614,Vie Winery 2005 Beatty Ranch Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"The fault with this enormous Zin is that despite a hefty 15.6% alcohol, it still tastes as sweet as a ruby Port. Fifty percent new oak only contributes caramel to what should properly be labeled a dessert wine.",39.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
11617,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Calvin Clarion Red (New Mexico),"A pretty floral nose and appetizing, juicy flavors of jammy fruit should recommend this wine, but there's a bitterness on the midplate and finish that make the wine a touch too angular. Pair with food to even it out.",28.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
11623,Dos Cabezas 2005 El Norte Red (Cochise County),"This Mourvèdre/Grenache/Petite Sirah blend offers appealing aromas and flavors of spicy berry and smoke, with good structure and length. The smoky character borders on excessive, though, so pair it with some grilled, spicy ribs or kebabs for the best experience.",20.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
11637,Jana 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"The brambly wild berry flavors have an exotic edge of white pepper and Chinese five-spice that's interesting and even complex. But the wine is utterly lacking in acidity, which makes it syrupy even though it's totally dry.",35.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
11933,Hunter Ashby 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"With cherry, black raspberry, red currant and licorice flavors wrapped into an elegantly light body, this Merlot may appeal to consumers who find Cabernet Sauvignon too heavy. It's an easy commercial wine to drink now.",23.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
11937,Martin & Weyrich 2005 Meritage Red (Paso Robles),"Softly forward and tasty, this Merlot-based wine, which is a blend of all 5 Bordeaux varieties, is an easy-drinking wine.

11941,Tin Barn 2005 Dalraddy Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"From the warm Chiles Valley portion of Napa, this Zin is solidly in the New World, cult Cab style of softness and extreme ripeness. The flavors of milk chocolate flood the mouth, with fruit notes of cherries, currants and plums, as well as a mélange of spices in the finish.",27.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
12019,Alexandria Nicole 2005 Destiny Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The estate's top Bordeaux blend, it's full-bodied and inviting, a vibrant bowl-full of red and black fruits, laced with baking spices. A worthy follow-up to the winery's outstanding 2004, this fruit-driven, well-balanced and flat-out bodacious style of winemaking should have enormous consumer appeal. Can it improve in the cellar? Give it five years to find out.",45.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
12034,Andrew Will 2005 Sheridan Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"Aromatic, chocolaty and deliciously smooth, the Sheridan vineyard bottling sends up sweet scents of ground coffee and chocolate. Compact fruit flavors of fig and black cherry run right into a bourbon barrel finish, with granular tannins that add welcome texture and a streak of graphite.",60.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
12333,Clos Pegase 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Shows some vegetal unripeness throughout, along with cherry and currant flavors enhanced with the usual smoky oak. A disappointment.",27.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

12820,Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine.",145.0,96,3,0.966990360015615
13051,Legacy 2005 Red (Alexander Valley),"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very fine, but young. It needs time to allow the aggressive tannins to resolve and for the blackberry, black currant and herb flavors to emerge. New oak adds a sweet smokiness that will become an integral part of the final wine.",75.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
13242,Ahnfeldt 2005 Quid Pro Quo Red (Napa Valley),"Very ripe in the modern style, with masses of jammy blackberries, black currants and black cherries and uplifted, smoky notes of oak. The tannins are thick and astringent. One defect is a certain sharpness that lasts through the finish and makes the mouthfeel tart.",49.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
13516,Highway 12 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon - Cabernet Franc - Merlot Red (Sonoma Valley),"Shows lots of complexity, with a mèlange of blackberry, cherry, currant, mushu plum sauce, olive tapenade, black pepper and lightly oaked flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Fine and dry, but a bit on edge now. Give it a year or two to soften.",24.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
13519,Zefina 2005 Tempranillo (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is the first Tempranillo from Zefina (just 60 cases made) from vines planted at the Alder Ridge vineyard in 1999. It is soft, fruity and dark, with some pretty spice showing in the nose. There are attractive floral notes, sweet herbs and a mix of light red fruits to follow. The tannins are soft and the acids are well under control, leading into a lightly chocolaty finish.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
13526,Pellegrini 2005 Cloverdale Ranch Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A very nice Merlot, brimming with cherries, blackberries, mocha and sage. Feels drier and more tannic than most coastal Merlots and is terrifically versatile at the table.",24.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
13534,Cru Vin Dogs 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Drink this lusty, hearty red wine now with beef stew and sausage casseroles. It's a big, softly tannic wine that's sweet with blackberry, licorice and chocolate flavors.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
14116,Morrison Lane 2005 Counoise (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Finished at just 12.9% alcohol, the cuttings for this interesting wine came from Tablas Creek. It brings light, tart, cranberry and red fruit flavors. Somehow an impression of butter creeps into the finish, which lingers surprisingly given the lightness of the wine, over all.",33.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
14129,Reininger 2005 Seven Hills Vineyard Carmenère (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine greets you with evocative scents that showcase Carmenère's leafy, herbal nature without becoming too raw or vegetal. The fruit is subdued and tart; the flavors are spicy and very peppery and lead into tannins that have the scrapey austerity of green tea. It's 100% varietal and brings both the good and the challenging flavor aspects of the Carmenère grape.",45.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
15069,Tsillan Cellars 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light and toasty, this is a pleasant, entry-level red wine with just a hint of chocolate in the finish. It's smooth and generic, but adds some spice and flesh once it's in the glass.",28.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
15074,Covey Run 2005 Quail Series Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This budget-priced Syrah is lean and peppery, with plenty of color and tannin. There are simple flavors of red currants, supported with lightly earthy tannins and proportionate acids.",9.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
15189,Madrigal 2005 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This is a beautiful Zinfandel. It exhibits all the wild, exotic forest berry-cherry flavors you could want, flooded with briary spices and notes of currants and mint that go on forever in the finish. Yet it also has Napa's perfect tannins and the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon. First-class Zin, a chef's dream to play with.",26.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
15576,Sineann 2005 Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine named simply Blend is – guess what! – a mix of Columbia valley grapes, including Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel and Grenache. This is bigger and spicier than Sineann's other blend, called simple Red Table Wine, and shows more concentration. The acids and tannins are in a stand-off at the moment, but throw a steak into the mix and you'll have a party.",24.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
15584,V. Sattui 2005 Quaglia Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"You can taste the warm sunshine in the spicy berry flavors of this Zin. It comes right up to the edge of overripe, with suggestions of bitter raisins, then pulls back to let the cassis and cherry liqueur shine through.",33.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
15596,Townshend 2005 Lemberger (Yakima Valley),"If anyone can make converts to Lemberger, Washington's one-time answer to Zinfandel, it's talented winemaker Don Townshend. This bright, tangy, raspberry-laden wine comes across as a stable-mate to Grenache or a light Dry Creek Zin, but it really occupies a niche all its own. Barrel-aged and ripened to a moderate 13.5% alcohol, it screams out for pizza.",15.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
15671,Kamiak 2005 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Pure Syrah, this is the most limited of the Kamiakin wines (in terms of production), but in many respects the star of the show. Peppery, racy and concentrated, it's packed with blueberry, kirsch and cassis. The finish is laced with coffee liqueur flavors, suggesting a far more expensive, barrel-aged wine.",18.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
15930,Robert Hall 2005 Hall Ranch Meritage (Paso Robles),"The hallmarks of this blend of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc and other Bordeaux varieties are a soft, gentle texture and ripe, forward fruit.

15932,Tolosa 2005 Edna Ranch Syrah (Edna Valley),"If you liked the winery's far more expensive “1772” bottling of Syrah, you'll find an approximation of it here, at about half the price. Dry and balanced, with typical Edna Valley acidity, it's marked by black cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate-covered mint and peppery spice flavors.",22.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
16418,Petroni 2005 Poggio Alla Pietra Brunello di Sonoma Estate Grown Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley),"This is a silly name, and it's not a very good wine. Acids and tannins dominate, making it astringent and bitter, and the cherry fruit is thin and rather overripe.",60.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
16981,Morgan 2005 Syrah (Monterey),"This is very good wine, showing total dryness, richness of tannins and herb-laden blackberry fruit. The tannins impress with their dry astringency, but the fruit is so rich and intense, the wine so balanced with acidity, that mid-term cellaring seems a good bet. Drink 2008–2011.",24.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
17160,Verve 2005 Syrah (Sonoma Mountain),"Tight, tannic and bone dry, this ultralow production wine comes from the small, somewhat obscure Sonoma Mountain appellation. It aims high, with the Northern Rhône the model. The blackberry and black currant flavors have an edge of smoky oak. Judging from the way the wine gains interest in the glass as it warms, it should have a fine future.",28.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17167,Sequel 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Australian winemaker John Duval is the winemaker for Long Shadows' signature Syrah. His experience shows in the Oz-like color (almost black), the spicy berry, plum, cherry and currant fruit, and the silky, polished tannins. Interestingly, Duval uses a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, rather than going with Viognier. The wine seems to be holding something back; it's definitely got some years ahead.",55.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17168,L'Ecole No. 41 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a powerful, sappy, sensuous and fragrantly fruit-driven mix of Syrah from the Seven Hills, Clifton, Bacchus, Candy Mountain, Willard, Pheasant and Stone Tree vineyards—a true Columbia Valley potpourri. It's blended with 7% Grenache from Stone Tree as well, adding floral/violet highlights. It's a well-made Syrah that reflects the particular Washington profile of floral aromas, tart berry fruit and juicy acids. Excellent focus and definition in a style built for acid lovers.",25.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17175,Betz Family 2005 La Cote Rousse Syrah (Red Mountain),"The second of three Syrahs from Betz, this is thick and dark, heavy with still-chewy tannins, this rich and compact wine needs more time in bottle. It's done in a big, toasty style, with lush black cherry fruit set against smoky, chewy tannins. It has a lot of power, but in its current (quite youthful) stage of development it remains stubbornly tight, herbal and hard. Give it plenty of breathing and/or cellar time.",50.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17179,Fielding Hills 2005 Riverbend Red Red (Wahluke Slope),"The blend is 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot, 11% Syrah and a splash of Cab Franc. This is nicely sculpted, with the typical plush midpalate, matching crisp red berries to butterfat. The fruit is sleek and has an underpinning of mineral and accents of fennel. Though the alcohol tops out at a hefty 14.7%, the fruit can handle it.",32.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17180,Soos Creek 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
17192,Bray 2005 Vino Tinto Red (Lodi),"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.",22.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
17440,Meridian 2005 Merlot (California),"A solid value from Meridian. Satisfies for its wealth of blackberry, currant, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Finishes with a fine, crisp scour.",10.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
17517,Buzzard Tree 2005 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A soft, medicinal and uninteresting wine, marked by harshness and green flavors that barely suggest cherries.",12.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
17519,Four Vines 2005 The Peasant Red (Paso Robles),"A red Rhône blend that's too soft, hot and sweet. It has the taste of sugary raspberry jam and is not a dry table wine.",38.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
17520,Four Vines 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.",18.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
17523,Chalk Hill 2005 Botrytised Sémillon (Chalk Hill),"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",55.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
17575,Carr 2005 Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),"Grown in the Happy Canyon section of eastern Santa Ynez, an area that one of these days will be an official appellation. It's warm back in that canyon, and this Sangiovese is sugary in sweet berries and cherries. Has nothing in common at all with Italian Sangiovese.",22.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
17598,Rancho Zabaco 2005 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",45.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
17627,Rutherford Grove 2005 Spring Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (St. Helena),"Fruit stars in this dry, young Petite Sirah. It explodes with jammy flavors of blackberries, cassis, cherries, licorice and plums, with a generous dusting of cinnamon and cocoa. It's distinguished, while holding onto the variety's brawny rusticity.",37.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
17637,Eno 2005 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),"Give this lush young wine a year or two to come around. That should give all the elements time to meld. It's a juicy, ripe wine, bursting with jammy cherry and cassis flavors, with a strong note of white pepper and clove that dissolves into a tannic finish.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
17808,Bourassa Vineyards 2005 Rhapsody 3 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Similar to past bottlings, Bourassa's 2005 Syrah is slightly rustic. It has a baked-fruit quality of blackberry and black cherry pie filling, and is very peppery. Given the right fare, such as a pepper steak, it could work some magic.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
17883,Montevina 2005 Terra d'Oro Barbera (Amador County),"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety. The flavors are all dry: dried blackberries and cherries, dried leather, cured tobacco leaf, beef jerky, star anise. Yet there's a fruity sweetness that's charming. Great with almost anything starring sausage.",18.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
17886,Sylvester 2005 Nikiara Red (Paso Robles),"This is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend, and it shows Paso's ability to produce a ripe, gentle red wine that's immediately appealing. There's a nice earthiness to the cassis flavors, and a rich, tannic structure that makes you dream of a perfectly broiled steak or chop, brushed with brown butter sauce with a touch of garlic.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
17893,Buena Vista 2005 Syrah (Carneros),"A grilled steak will play nicely against the tannins and acids of this Syrah, grown in the cool Carneros district north of San Francisco. The black peppercorn and blackberry flavors suggest a butter-enriched wine reduction sauce. Best now and for a couple years.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18101,Airfield Estates 2005 Aviator Red Red (Yakima Valley),"The Aviator Red is a well-crafted blend that mixes strawberry, raspberry, pepper and stone in an effective balance that seems to draw the best from each grape. For a modest, everyday wine, this works quite well.",28.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18103,Basel Cellars 2005 Chelle den Millie Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"After almost losing a finger struggling to remove the rock-hard faux wax “capsule” I found this strawberry/cherry cordial-flavored wine quite pleasant. The fruit, from a Rattlesnake Hills vineyard, has a sweet core, while the tannins add an earthy streak of green tea.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18106,Columbia Crest 2005 Beverly Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18107,Foundry Vineyards 2005 Artisan Blend Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This pure Cabernet Sauvignon is not a heavy wine, but within its sleek profile are interesting flavors of berry, leaf and earth. Tannins are crisp and proportionate, and the fruit carries through a graceful, moderately long finish.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18113,Alexandria Nicole 2005 Grenache (Horse Heaven Hills),"Sweet plum and pie cherry fruit highlights a bright and spicy style. The young vines push all the flavor up front, then hold on for dear life as the midpalate lingers on a note of lightly chocolaty plum. The tannins need some softening; there is a stemmy flavor that slightly mars the finish.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18615,Barrister 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An aromatic, seductive wine, scented with smoke and chocolate, cedar and strawberry. Thick and chewy, with ripe raspberry fruit and a liquorous, barrel-inflected finish. This is a big wine for those who like sheer power, in both fruit and tannins.",23.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
18686,Morrison Lane 2005 Cinsault (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Made as a pure variety, this rare example of Walla Walla Cinsault—is scented with lovely whiffs of berries, plums and moist earth. It falls somewhere in the same stylistic region as Sangiovese and Pinot Noir, with bright, sharp, acidic fruit flavors.",27.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18691,Viento 2005 Lonesome Spring Ranch Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lovely, light, fresh and delicate, this Barbera is young, juicy and appealing. The fruit mixes light berry flavors with tart, tangy acids; the flavors seem to gather in the mid-palate, showing excellent concentration. No new oak is evident, nor is it missed. The alcohol remains comfortably below 14%, and the fruit is light but quite ripe, with no green edges.",24.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
18723,Cave B 2005 SageCliffe 100 Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a fruity, rustic wine, with broad mixed berry and cherry flavors. They lead into an earthy and tannic (and short) finish.",22.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
19083,Bookwalter 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2005 continues along the established path of this rising star winery. It's big, no holds barred, rich and jammy, and just a bit warm at 14.8% alcohol. The fruit is nicely woven together, brambly and dark, and coated with clean barrel flavors of coffee and chocolate. Everything is balanced and forward, but you get the sense that this wine is holding something back for the future.",36.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
19086,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand.",18.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
19092,Crauford 2005 Kilt Lifter Brown Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A great Zin from Napa, this shows the classic structure of a claret, but with Zin's distinctive personality. Briary, brambly wild berries, mocha and masses of white pepper are the aromas and flavors.",32.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
19298,Ferrari-Carano 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With small amounts of Carignane and Petite Sirah, this hails from the winery's estate vineyard in Dry Creek Valley, one of the great sources of Zinfandel in California. It is a very fine Zin, showing near perfect balance. Tannic and dry, the blackberry, blueberry, cherry, chocolate, sweet leather and spice flavors are enriched with the vanilla and smoky char of oak.",30.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
19363,Sanctuary 2005 Mariah Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),"Robust and briary, this Zin is bone-dry and pretty tannic, with earthy flavors of blackberries, tobacco, currants and spices. Could mellow with age, but will never be particularly complex.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615

19774,La Capilla 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Rich in ripe, forward fruit, with oaky influences, this dry Syrah has pepper-infused black currant and cherry flavors, with a nice, smoky finish. It's a full-bodied wine whose tannins are strong but sweetly ripe, in the modern style. Drink now.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
19776,Ojai 2005 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Tastes a bit forward and simple right now in cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, framboise and orange datenut cookie flavors, with a silky texture and fine, ripe tannins. Could develop interesting bottle complexities over the next 6–8 years.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
19778,Renwood 2005 Zinfandel (Fiddletown),"With an edge of sweet red currants and slightly sugared herb tea, this Zin can't really be called completely dry. But the tannin-acid balance is very fine, and makes the wine balanced and enjoyable. Should be great with pasta with a marinara sauce.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
19787,Easton 2005 Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Easton continues to be devoted to its Barbera, which as always is a big, tannicly dry mountain wine. It's packed with blackberry, coffee, chocolate and spice flavors, with a distinctly baked quality, like macaroons. Should age forever.",22.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
19817,Pellegrini 2005 Family Blend Red (Sonoma County),"Simple and rustic but perfect for backyard grilling, this Zinfandel, Merlot and Carignane blend is robust, tannic and superripe in berry-cherry and spice flavors. Cries out for rich BBQ sauce.",14.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
20375,Bradford Mountain 2005 El Grandote Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This sound, Port-style wine is made from Zinfandel. It shows briary flavors of wild red and black berries, milk chocolate and Christmas plum pudding, with spices of cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. Could use greater structure, as it's a bit soft.",30.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
20377,OZV 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Robust and exuberant, this wine doesn't pull any punches. It unleashes a blast of wild berry, currant, pepper and chai tea flavors, wrapped into sturdy but finely ground tannins. Easy to drink with barbecue.",15.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
21489,Rominger West 2005 Syrah (Yolo County),"A sound wine, dry and full-bodied, that can't quite shake off its country-cousin personality. With strong tannins and berry-cherry and herb flavors, all it needs is a rich cheeseburger to make it happy.",20.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
21555,Clos La Chance 2005 Rhône Red Wine Red (Central Coast),"With 6 Rhône varieties, including Viognier, this is a fresh, fruity wine meant to be consumed within the next five years.

21566,Rodney Strong 2005 Knotty Vines Estate Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‘04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",20.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
21571,Left Coast Cellars 2005 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce.",18.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
21940,Vice Versa 2005 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This very rich, unctuous Syrah is immature and not especially subtle at this time. It's acidic and gooey in jammy blackberries and cherries and milk chocolate, with obvious oak influences. The idea seems to be ageworthiness, but that's a gamble. Could surprise.",65.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
22220,Seven Hills 2005 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Two different Tempranillo clones are aged in 100% American oak.

22222,Andrew Rich 2005 Coup d'Etat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a tangy, berry-powered blend. Hard not to like the fresh, zippy, highly acidic flavors of tart raspberries; flavors that are sharp and almost crunchy, but deliciously vibrant. This is what Dry Creek Zinfandel used to taste like before it turned into rocket fuel.",24.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
22223,Andrew Rich 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A young, juicy, assertive Syrah that pits its blackberry and black cherry fruit against a strong streak of smoky licorice. The acids are still a little awkward, but time should help with that. Otherwise, it's got a lot of power and grace, with classic, tangy Washington berry flavors and pleasing hints of earth and leaf in the finish.",24.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
22489,Adobe Road 2005 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",34.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
22491,Bourassa Vineyards 2005 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"With its blast of briary, brambly wild berries and black pepper, this is a classic Zin. The lusty flavors range through blackberries and cherries and mulberries to cola and root beer. Despite the hefty tannins, it's ready now with grilled meats or pasta with tomato sauce.",28.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
22494,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With nearly 17% alcohol, aficianados of high-octane Zin will love this bottling's wealth of black currant, blueberry jam, chocolate and anise flavors that finish dry and peppery.",60.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
22679,Brutocao 2005 Quadriga Red (Mendocino),"This Italian-inspired blend from Brutocao gets better every vintage. The 2005 contains Primitivo, Sangiovese, Dolcetto and Barbera. With a rich earthy, mushroomy, leathery quality to the cherry-blackberry fruit, it has a great balance of acids and tannins, and finishes bone dry. Ideal across a wide variety of foods.",24.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
22681,Trespass 2005 Rendezvous Red (Napa Valley),"From a small vineyard in St. Helena comes this ripe young wine, a Cab Franc-based Bordeaux blend. It's soft and forward, with cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate and cedar flavors that show Napa tannins at their smooth, ripe best. It's a little tight now, so give it a few years.",65.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
22683,Lake Sonoma 2005 Saini Farms Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine does better when alcohol levels are elevated, which ripens and fattens the fruit. Here,  the alcohol is 15%, and the juicy flavors range from blackberry and mulberry jam through chocolate and sweet briary tobacco to exotic vanilla and Asian spices. Then there's the structure, near-perfect in acids and tannins.",22.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
22709,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2005 Cyrus Red (Alexander Valley),"Soft, herbal and very fruity, with ripe blackberry, cherry and black raspberry flavors. The herbs show up as a background note of sage and dill. Polished and dry, with earthy tannins, and best now–2011.",55.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
23283,Va Piano 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley-Walla Walla Valley),"Smooth, luscious, dense and brilliant—the color is saturated and superbright—this silky wine has kept the tannins supple and ripe. It captures the essence of young, fresh, spicy Syrah, unadulterated or modified with other grapes. This is tight, firm, sappy, young and a bit relentless in a tough, confident style. Flavors of cranberry and wild raspberry run rampant, with plenty of acid to keep it clean and penetrating.",38.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
23284,Walter Dacon 2005 C'est Syrah Magnifique Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Magnifique is a barrel selection from the French oak-aged side of the winery. It's 100% Syrah and packed with blackberry, black cherry and streaks of citrus. It's very well balanced, complete and firm; the wine should age nicely for another decade at least.",38.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
23299,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin.

23313,Truchard 2005 Zinfandel (Carneros),"Here's a ripe, lusty Zinfandel that shows the balance and harmony of Napa Carneros terroir, with Zin's explosive flavors. Fills the mouth with blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mulberries, orange zest, figs, chocolate, cloves, pepper and vanilla, with a long, spicy sweet finish.",25.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
23314,Lancaster 2005 Sophia's Hillside Cuvée Red (Alexander Valley),"It's fair to call this a junior version of Lancaster's more expensive, superb Bordeaux-style wines. Like them, it's rich in black currant and cedar flavors, and quite tannic, a wine that needs a few years to come around. It's also a touch more rustic. Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, one quarter Merlot.",48.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
23364,Trentadue 2005 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"This Zin is powerful and delicious, yet never loses sight of balance and elegance. With the tannic structure of a fine Merlot, it has Zin's classic flavors of wild berries, cocoa and spices. At this price, a very great bargain. Sommeliers, scoop this one up by the case.",15.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
23818,Chandler Reach 2005 Estate Select Monte Regalo Red Red (Yakima Valley),"Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea. The tannins are supple and smooth, and there is a polish to the wine that extends into a smooth, seamless and very satisfying finish.",22.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
23820,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Carneros),"Gloria Ferrer's 2005 dry Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were both really good, so why shouldn't this bubbly blend of them be? And so it is.

24182,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",38.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
24680,Mill Creek 2005 Corner Pocket Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
24698,Forlorn Hope 2005 Gascony Cadets Petit Verdot (Suisun Valley),"Made from a grape usually used for blending into Bordeaux-style wines, Forlorn Hope's Petit Verdot is inky black, bone dry and very tannic. With massive blackberry and cherry flavors, it should age for many years.",42.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
24759,Jamesport 2005 Bloc E Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"While soft on the nose with a generous dose of cooked black fruit, Jamesport's Bloc E is surprisingly crisp and lean on the palate. Pristine red fruit shines amidst layers of mocha, spice and forest floor, finishing on a grippy, darkly toasted wood note.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
25085,Sylvester 2005 Port Syrah (Paso Robles),"Sugar saves the day in this dessert wine. It's very sweet and fruity, like a blackberry tart with the smoky crust, sauced up with sweetened espresso, shaved chocolate, candied orange zest and roasted coconut flakes.",25.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
25087,Zaca Mesa 2005 Z Cuvée Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Over the years this Rhône blend, based on Mourvédre, Grenache and Syrah, has been an excellent value, and the '05 is one of the best yet. Rich and soft, it's packed with opulent cherry and blackberry pie filling, cassis, red currant, licorice, pepper and smoke flavors, with a creamy, chocolaty taste throughout. Yet the wine is totally dry and balanced.",18.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
25104,Château Potelle 2005 V.G.S. Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),"The power of mountain fruit drives this young, impressive Zinfandel. It's a tight, tannic puppy right now, dry and aloof. But such are the massive blackberry, mulberry, espresso and pepper flavors that the wine should easily hold its own for many years. Best after 2008 and through 2013.",55.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
25147,Stevens 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind. Supple and sensuous, this is a wine to savor and, if possible, cellar for another decade.",28.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
25150,Treana 2005 Red (Paso Robles),"Quietly, under the radar, Treana's red blend is turning into an interesting and exciting wine over every vintage. The '05, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, shows Paso Robles terroir at its best. The wine is soft, but no softer than a cult Napa Cab, and enormously rich in currant, licorice, chocolate, smoky oak and cinnamon spice flavors that are just delicious. Best now and for a few years.",52.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
25166,Matthews Estate 2005 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely.",30.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
25167,Pedestal 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent with previous releases, this Michel Rolland effort is a soft, silky, smoky wine that introduces itself with round cherry fruit and then charges ahead with layers of licorice, citrus, coffee and rock that enliven the finish. There is plenty of tart raspberry fruit to open, and the balancing acids to give the wine a tight core. It's a very polished and appealing balance of forward, approachable fruit married to more elegant, ageworthy tannins and acids.",55.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
25168,Eric Guerra 2005 Ispiri Red (Alexander Valley),Not showing well now due to hard tannins and extreme dryness. There's a core of blackberry fruit but it's buried beneath astringency. This Merlot-based Bordeaux blend may develop.,45.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
25262,Stevenot 2005 Danza Roja Red (California),"A Rhône-style blend of Garnacha (Grenache), Mourvèdre, Tempranillo, Syrah and Graciano, this pretty wine is soft and dry. It has an earthy, dried herb taste, with suggestions of cherries, and is rich and complex enough to serve with special foods.",12.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
25486,Curtis 2005 Heritage Cuvée Red (Santa Barbara County),"Soft and one-dimensional, this red Rhône blend has flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, blueberry pie, chocolate and pepper. There's some bitterness throughout that detracts.",18.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
25489,Z-52 2005 Agnes' Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"The winery has had more success with their Amador County Zinfandel than this one from Lodi. Like its predecessors, it's dry and a bit harsh, with burnt fruit and pepper flavors and a sugary finish.",16.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
25499,Millésimé 2005 Scoprire Red (California),"Smells and tastes like caramel and stewed cherry and blackberry flavors that taste overtly sweet. However, this rustic blend of Syrah and Sangiovese may have its fans.",55.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
25532,Dunham 2005 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is pure Merlot from 10-year-old vines. Lush and chocolaty, it offers a broad, ripe and appealing set of seamless black fruit flavors. Powerful and high-toned, this adds licorice and mocha to the expansive finish.",75.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
25544,Von Strasser 2005 Monhoff Vineyard Zinfandel (Diamond Mountain District),"Cabernet specialist von Strasser turns to the only Zinfandel vineyard on this mountain to produce this dense, layered young wine. Well-oaked, it shows smoky flavors of blackberry marmalade, red and black currants and peppery spices, and has the texture of a fine Cabernet. Drink now through 2013.",45.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
25610,Hopper Creek 2005 Massa Ranch Petit Verdot (Napa Valley),"The oak and sweet jam flavors still haven't quite come together in this wine despite its age, and probably never will. With crisp acids and soft tannins, it's a nice, rich red wine to drink now.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
26496,Dominus 2005 Napanook Red (Yountville),"A very nice Cabernet-based wine from Dominus, the '05 Napanook is a shade less elegant than in the last few vintages, but is still a lush, attractive young wine. Filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting.",42.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
27217,Estancia 2005 Shiraz (Central Coast),"You'll need lots of rich, gooey cheese and oily meats to eat with this wine, because it's pretty harsh and thin on its own. Something like a cheeseburger will help it a lot.",12.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
27220,Kunde 2005 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"A little heavy, thick and jammy, like melted blackberry jelly mixed with alcohol. Okay with pizza, burgers and such.",18.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
27226,Pietra Santa 2005 Sassolino Red (Cienega Valley),"A dry, tannicly astringent wine that doesn't seem fully ripened. It has green, herb and mint-infused berry flavors. Cabernet, Colorino and Sangiovese.",18.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
27670,Mike Ditka 2005 Kick Ass Red Red (Mendocino),"Yes, it's from Da Coach, of Bears legend, and the wine lives up to its gluteus moniker. There's nothing subtle about this blend of Zin, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Viognier. It's big in brambly berry and citrus flavors, tannic, high in alcohol, rich in tannins, and made for tailgate barbecue.",50.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
27672,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Petit Verdot (California),"Dry, full-bodied and tannic, this wine is forward in blackberry jam, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors, with something meaty and leathery-sweet in the finish. It's a robust, even complex wine that will pair nicely with grilled meats.",40.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
27684,Shark Trust 2005 Sixgill Syrah (California),"Great value for the price, with blackberry marmalade, moo shu plum sauce, tobacco, leather and pepper flavors that turn richly tannic and spicy in the finish. Shows lots of elegance and finesse.",10.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
27881,Iron Horse 2005 Ultra Brut Sparkling (Green Valley),"This is the driest of Iron Horse's new releases, but it still has a honeyed richness even though the residual sugar is a comparatively low half a percent. It feels refined, fancy and elegant, with delicious raspberry, lime and toast flavors. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",50.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
27969,Woodward Canyon 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A muscular, dense and tannic Syrah with a distinctive mineral underpinning. The expression is focused on concentrated, tightly wound blackberry and cassis, with some alcoholic heat. This is almost Australian in its sculptural elegance, and needs breathing time to let the mix of licorice and coffee come out in the finish.",39.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
28417,Trinchero 2005 Chicken Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Rutherford),"Not as successful as the winery's Cabernet, this Merlot is very dry and tannic, with only modest blackberry fruit flavors, but it has a certain elegance. Turns oaky and herbal on the finish. Probably best soon.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
28431,Starry Night 2005 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"If you like your red wines soft, juicy and slightly sweet, this Syrah is for you. It's packed with blackberry, currant, mocha, plum, raisin and black pepper flavors, wrapped into gentle tannins. Drink now.",22.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
28514,Mazzocco 2005 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From a benchland vineyard, this Zin is riper than almost anything out there. Higher in alcohol, too, with an astounding 16.8%. That's almost Port—exactly what it tastes like, with caramelized blackberry berry, dark chocolate, and vanilla flavors.",36.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
28526,Bargetto 2005 Rosso Red (California),"Sweet, tannic and superfruity, this blend of Dolcetto, Zin, Merlot, Tempranillo and Carignane is rustic and clean. With its flood of blackberry, cherry, chocolate and spice flavors, it will happily wash down simple fare, like cheeseburgers.",12.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
28887,Tyrus Evan 2005 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate.",36.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
28889,Vin Nostro 2005 Syrah (Red Hills Lake County),"Shows good Syrah character, a rich, spicy, full-bodied wine with luscious flavors of blackberries, black cherries, figs and tangerine zest. There's also a tangy minerality that gives the wine backbone and verve. Shows the promise of this mountainous Lake County appellation.",25.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
29086,Kings Mountain 2005 Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Dry and clean, but this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend shows a surprising sharpness and hardness for a wine from this vintage, at this age. The black currant flavors are buried by tannic astringency. Doesn't seem likely to age.",48.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
29371,Page Cellars 2005 Syrah (Red Mountain),"Purple/black and compact, this wine needs plenty of breathing time to reveal its layers. Klipsun vineyard fruit brings power and tannic muscle. The aromas are intriguing; a bit overripe and raisiny, but also offering truffle, smoked meat and burnt toast.",37.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
29376,Three Rivers 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot gives this wine a broad and flavorful midpalate of mixed berry and currant and cherry fruit; it's got plenty of acid below and tannin behind, and it lays out beautifully across the palate. The finishing tannins are lightly earthy, lightly chocolaty, and suggest pencil shavings and a splash of anise as well. Excellent value.",19.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
29389,DeLille 2005 D2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"DeLille's D2 red (51% Merlot/38% Cabernet Sauvignon/8% Cab Franc/3% Petit Verdot) is a declassified wine in the best possible sense—the grapes come from all of the winery's premier vineyard sources. The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice. The wine gathers strength in the midpalate, then gradually unfolds through the finish with polished tannins that are just slightly herbal.",38.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
29393,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.",30.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
29396,Fielding Hills 2005 Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"The Wahluke Slope, Washington's second-newest AVA, is proving to be one of the great Syrah-growing regions in the country because of the purity of the fruit, with rich black cherry and blackberry fruit, spiced up with white pepper and hints of cured meat. It's still quite young and tightly wound, but air it out and you'll find hints of gravel and earth.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
29403,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2005 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Impresses for the sheer volume of fruit, with explosive blackberry, cherry, cassis, chocolate, licorice, gingerbread, cola and smoky oak flavors. The structure is very fine, with rich, ripely smooth tannins and good acidity. Delicious now, and should remain so for several years.",80.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
29428,Karly 2005 Pokerville Zinfandel (Amador County),"A really great mountain Zinfandel that shows luscious power and fruit at a fair price. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, oranges, cloves and white pepper flood the palate and are just wonderful to experience. At this price, buy this Zin by the case.",13.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
29432,Sunstone 2005 Founder's Reserve Red (California),"The Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Howell Mountain. The Sangiovese is from Sonoma Valley, and the Cab Franc comes from Santa Ynez Valley. The resulting blend is rewarding. Although it's a light-bodied wine, the power of the cherry, raspberry, chocolate, anise, vanilla, clove and pepper flavors is considerable.",93.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
29444,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Brodacious Red (Napa Valley),"Here's a powerfully fruity Napa red wine to drink tonight with roasts, cheeses, or just a nice burger.

29811,Hunt Cellars 2005 Red Velvet Red (Paso Robles),"The acidity is pretty fierce, but the wine is dry, and offers easy flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants and sandalwood. The blend is Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",65.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
30136,Kirkland Signature 2005 Signature Merlot (Napa Valley),"Too sweet in residual sugary flavors to earn a higher score, this Merlot shows jellied cherry and blackberry flavors. Those who like their red wines sweet will enjoy it.",10.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
30240,Indian Rock 2005 Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"An example of California Barbera at its best, this is brawny and muscular and rich in flavor, which makes it perfect for roasts and hearty pasta dishes. With firm tannins and crisp acidity, this one is filled with rewarding currant, mocha, olive tapenade and spice flavors.",22.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
30713,Domaine Ste. Michelle 2005 Luxe Sparkling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pure Chardonnay, Luxe is finished at lower alcohol (at least according to the fact sheets) than the other sparklers in this lineup. It is definitely the wine with the most depth; it has a roundly fruity core of lemon cake and light citrus.",23.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
30806,Baldassari Family Wines 2005 Syrah (North Coast),"Here's a full-bodied, dry, tannic Syrah that displays elegance and balance.

30816,Schramsberg 2005 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin),"Made from 90% Pinot Noir with the balance Chardonnay, this beautifully colored bubbly shows the integrity the house of Schramsberg brings to its sparkling wines. It's not truly dry, but the raspberry, cherry, lime, vanilla and brioche flavors are delicious.",37.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
31303,Tildio 2005 SBW Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This pleasant Merlot/Cabernet blend brings ripe cherry fruit flavors that border on raisiny. It's forward, round, soft and fruity, with the Merlot definitely dominating the front, while the Cabernet adds a bit of weight and substance to the finish.",22.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
31479,Pellegrini Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Crisp red plum and cherry flavors accented with ripe, brambly wood notes are pleasant, but coarse tannins combined with a slightly craggy acidity make this Long Island Cab Franc less than harmonious on the palate.",20.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
31555,Luko 2005 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Expensive, but worth it. Absolutely a first-rate dry red wine of great substance and authority. Shows full-bodied blackberry flavors with a meaty, leathery edge and hints of violets, tobacco, pepper and cocoa. Such is the tannic structure that the wine should develop through 2012.",52.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
31793,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Alder Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Washington),"This opens with a powerful, sharp and spicy set of aromas mixing dense blackberry and boysenberry fruit with sweet smoke and chocolate-covered raisins. This is a fine effort, with sappy fruit, tart acids, streaks of leaf and vanilla, a burst of tobacco in the mid-palate, and a smooth finish with polish and verve.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
31794,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Opulence Syrah (Washington),"Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
31796,Tamayo Family 2005 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Syrah and Dry Creek Valley have long been good partners, and this dry, rich wine shows why. It's firm in tannins, but they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grit to play against fine grilled beef or lamb. The flavors are textbook, suggesting black currants, black raspberries, violets, anisette and dark chocolate.",24.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
32218,Hestia Cellars 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dark, sappy and reductive, it shows skillful winemaking and sensitivity to vineyard management. The color is there, the aromas are pure and the flavors are balanced, without being overripe. It captures a pleasing mix of berries and currants. Tannins are quite dry and lightly peppery.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
32220,Kiamie 2005 Kiamie Kuvée Red (Paso Robles),"An unusual blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Syrah, Malbec and Zinfandel, this wine shows the multi-variety approach increasingly taken by Paso vintners, for the sake of complexity. It's soft and very ripe, with jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, finished with milk chocolate, licorice, violets and peppery vanilla.",44.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
32224,Viento 2005 Cuvée Tuition Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though no new oak was used in the élévage of this wine, it has a lovely, toasty backdrop to the aromas of fresh rose petals, spicy tobacco and tart plum. This is nicely rounded, keeping the acids from dominating and allowing the fruit to display itself gently and without any rough edges. In the mouth the acids come forward, but they are so fresh, natural and clean that it's a genuine pleasure.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615

32446,Toogood 2005 Buchert Vineyard Malbec (El Dorado),"An impressively dark, powerfully structured and deeply flavored wine, this Malbec brims with explosive blackberry, black currant, crushed peppercorn and leather flavors.

32461,Michael Florentino Cellars 2005 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Winemaker Michael Haddox is exploring unusual, emerging grape varieties in Washington State. This well-made Malbec is just the start, showing dried cherry fruit, graham cracker toast, and hints of stone and graphite. It's chewy and muscular, an interesting debut for the winery.",38.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
32589,Rodney Strong 2005 Symmetry Red Meritage (Alexander Valley),"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. It shows a deep streak of dark stone fruits, black and blue berries, cassis, carob, violets and smoky cedar. Fine and elegant now, and it should develop nicely over the next decade.",60.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
32591,Duckhorn 2005 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Deeply impressive on every level, from the profound, inviting aromas of currants and fine oak to the mouthfeel, which is plush and important. Encased in a superb structure of acidity and firm tannins are ripe, complex flavors of currants, violets, olive tapenade and oatmeal raisin cookies. Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more.",85.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
32592,Duckhorn 2005 Three Palms Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Duckhorn's Three Palms bottling is one of the oldest and most consistent Merlot vineyard designations in California and this is a classic example. The wine always is very tannic. But the '05 is dry and rich and complex in mineral-laden cherries and currants, with just the right application of new oak. You can decant it now for several hours and enjoy with a dramatically charred steak, but it will develop beautifully through 2011, at least.",85.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
32596,Gargiulo 2005 Five Seventy Five OVX G Major 7 Study Red (Oakville),"Despite the silly name, this is a deeply impressive, but very young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It needs time in the cellar. It practically oozes ripe, pie-filling blackberries and cherries as well as sweet, smoky new oak. It's all primary flavor now, but very balanced, and should come into its own after 2010.",125.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
32792,Skylite 2005 Skylite Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe. The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.",24.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
32802,Tin Barn 2005 Gilsson Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Despite some well-ripened red and black currant, licorice and cola flavors, this dry Zin has a bitterness in the finish that gives it a bit of a rustic feel. Drink now.",27.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
32805,Lolonis 2005 Winegrower Selection Golden Vineyard Petite Sirah (Redwood Valley),"Has an old-fashioned, rustic quality, an acidic, bone-dry wine with sour cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors that finish with some bitterness.

33340,Pomum 2005 Shya Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"This is a Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux blend from a variety of well-respected Yakima Valley vineyards. Despite a little sweatiness in the nose, the wine has some sleek, racy berry flavored fruit. It shows only moderate concentration in the midpalate, with juicy acids and firm tannins. The finish turns watery, a bit dilute, with raspberry and pale red currant notes.",34.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
33347,Sausal 2005 Family Old Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Almost like an Aussie Shiraz, this is a big, bold, jammy wine, full-bodied in ripe blackberries, cherries, mulberries, milk chocolate and spicy pepper flavors. It's technically dry, but so filled with fruity essence, it has a honeyed finish.",18.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
33348,Sebastiani 2005 Secolo Red Wine Red (Sonoma County),"This is the winery's Meritage red, although with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon they could have bottled it as that variety. It's nearly always Sebastiani's best Bordeaux-style wine, but the '05 is something of a letdown from past vintages. It's elegantly structured and nicely flavored, with subtle currant, cherry, olive and smoke flavors, but has a bitter taste throughout.",35.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
33447,Gorman 2005 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain),"A tannic, brambly, earthy wine, this pure Red Mountain Syrah was kept in neutral oak and minimally racked. At first it shows a tart and chalky character; then there begins to emerge lovely concentrated black cherry and loganberry fruit, along with a backbone of ash, graphite and coffee. On the second day it has softened and expanded with an engaging mix of fruit, herb, pepper and Red Mountain rock.",35.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
33451,Shafer 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Shafer's Cabernet is so dominant, it's sometimes forgotten how good their Merlot can be. The wines are dependably dry, rich and balanced, as the excellent '05 demonstrates. It's soft and drinkable now, but rich and sweet in tannins that frame cherry, currant, cola, licorice and vanilla flavors. Will reward cellaring through 2011.",46.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
33468,Syncline 2005 Subduction Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Syrah/Grenache/Mourvèdre blend, finished in screwcap, is always one of Washington's best values and flat out most delicious Rhône blends. The 2006 is the best ever, with dark, supple fruits that weave together berries, cherries, plums, cassis, licorice, pepper and Provençal herbs. It's a riot of flavors, young and brash, but perfectly capable of aging.",18.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
33599,Gamache 2005 Boulder Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Gamache brothers call this blend, which is half Cabernet Franc, one quarter Merlot, and the rest split between Malbec and Syrah, a happy accident—the result of having a shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. The Franc is a great base wine, a little rough and green, but packed with firm, cool-site red grape flavors. Aromatic and tasting of mixed fruits, it's blended just ahead of bottling, so the juice gets the same care as the pricier varietal wines.",18.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
33601,Rosenblum 2005 Chateau La Paws Côte du Bone Roan Red (California),"A blend of Syrah, Zin and several other Rhône varieties, this is a soft, lusty wine, likeable for its array of ripe, forward fruit flavors. Cherries, blackberries, raspberries and licorice flood the mouth, finishing with a peacock's tail of dusty Asian spices.",14.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
33607,Latah Creek 2005 Cabernet-Syrah (Washington),"This 50/50 blend brings a bowl full of sweet cherry fruit to the nose; it's hard to resist after the first sniff. There's plenty of glycerin and a lushness to the mouthfeel, and the fruit flavors pile on sweet streaks of cherry, plum and raisin. Much of the pleasure is right up front, and the wine turns a bit stiff and stemmy as it heads down the back stretch.",20.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
33617,Airfield Estates 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"A pretty cherry red, this tart young wine tastes like fresh raspberries and cherries. It is compactly built, varietal and clean, with a crisply-defined finish.",22.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
33651,Twisted Oak 2005 The Spaniard Red (Calaveras County),"Twisted Oak has a pretty serious track record with this wine. The '05, a blend of Tempranillo, Graciano and Garnacha (Grenache), is very dry and complex. It's soft but firmly tannic, with juicy flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomengranates, licorice, chocolate, cloves and pepper. Has the body of a fine Pinot Noir, with different flavors.",45.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
33734,Valley of the Moon 2005 Syrah (Sonoma County),"Beautiful Syrah at a fair price. It's soft and velvety, with rich, complex flavors of chocolate, blackberries, succulent anise biscotti and violets, with smoky, cedary notes from oak. Drink now.",16.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
33735,Venge 2005 Scout's Honor Red (Napa Valley),"This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Charbono is similar to wines made from those field-blended vineyards where several grape varieties are inter-planted. The wine is dry and robust, with intensely fruity, spicy flavors and firm tannins. Best now for its sheer exuberance.",38.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
34504,Rosenblum 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Reserve Petite Sirah (Rockpile),"An overly soft, alcoholic wine. It tastes like the blackberry and cola syrup that goes into soda, before the carbonation is added, and finishes prickly hot.",45.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
34505,VJB 2005 Barbera (Mendocino),"Made in an old-fashioned way, this is the kind of wine the immigrants probably drank. It's soft, fruity-raisiny and simple, with enough tannins and acids to combat tomato sauce and garlic.",34.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
34511,Michael David 2005 Lust Zinfandel (Lodi),"I think by “lust” they mean something like a decadent chocolate truffle with a gooey cherry liqueur filling. That's what this sweetish wine, which has 15.9% alcohol, tastes like. It is awfully tasty, but it's hard to imagine what you'd drink it with, except, well, a chocolate truffle.",49.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
34513,Damian Rae 2005 White Hawk Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Dry enough, but the fruit has a baked, raisiny taste, suggesting that some of the grapes got by the sorting table in a shriveled condition. The finish is tannic and rich in blackberries and spices, but the wine is not an ager.",48.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
34515,Rosenblum 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"I love the briary, spicy aroma on this wine. It's so inviting. But then when you taste it, it turns too soft and sweet, like a melted cherry- and cassis-filled chocolate truffle. That's a delicious flavor, but it's not really a dry table wine.",35.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35344,Fiddlehead 2005 Hunnysuckle Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"At the age of five-plus, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is showing some mileage. It's losing freshness, with dried pineapple, apricot and peach flavors emerging, and an edge of cashews and dried herbs. Yet it remains lively and clean. If you're unfamiliar with an older Sauvignon Blanc, try it. Fully ready now.",34.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
35435,Mark Ryan 2005 Wild Eyed Red (Red Mountain),"Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
35443,Barrister 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit is perfectly ripe and succulent, a juicy mix of berries and black cherries. It's set against firm but ripe and polished tannins, which provide muscle and add some spice as well. The oak contributes just the right level of toast, not too heavy. The exceptional, sweet and tasty fruit takes the center stage, while the pretty oak flavors do the final curtain call.",25.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
35444,Acorn 2005 Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",34.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
35445,Bella 2005 Big River Ranch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.",36.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
35638,Beringer 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Simple and soft, this is one to drink now. It rewards for the wealth of cherry, blackberry, licorice and cocoa flavors that finish dry and clean.",20.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35720,Atwater 2005 Red Table Wine Meritage (Finger Lakes),"This wine is a solid, stylish Meritage with assertive red fruit, a black pepper backbone and plenty of structure for aging. A touch of oaked spice adds dimension. A good overall red to pair with hearty winter fare.",25.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35727,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Meritage (New Mexico),"This wine has an elegant edge, with its hints of tea, spice and mint on the nose and its pleasant, harmonious plum and red berry flavors on the palate. Easy to drink and food-pairing friendly.",23.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35732,Sunstone 2005 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"A soft, dry and easy wine to like, this Merlot has flavors of cherries, blackberries, Asian spices and cola, with smoky overtones of oak. Drink now.",28.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35734,McGregor 2005 Black Russian Red Red (Finger Lakes),"How's this for exotic: this red blend is made from the vinifera grapes Saperavi (from the former Soviet Georgia) and Sereksiya Charni (generally from Moldova). On the nose, the wine displays clove, tart berry, raspberry and black pepper, and on the palate, like flavors and solid tannins. There's a touch of dried tea to the blend and a decent finish, but the wine needs time to age--consider holding it for 5-10 years for the complexity to unfold. Overall, an appealing and interesting choice.",60.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
35769,Amapola Creek 2005 Monto Rosso Vineyard Viñas Antiguas Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Consumers need to be warned that this Zin has 16.3% alcohol, which puts it nearly in Port territory. That aside, it's a good example of its style, which lots of people like. Dry and well-structured in acids and tannins, it shows rich flavors of red and black currants, anise, cola and crushed pepper.",55.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
35940,Ceago Vinegarden 2005 Winemaker's Blend Red (Clear Lake),"Firmly tannic and dry, with powerful currant, licorice and cocoa flavors and a bit of a raisiny bitterness in the finish. Mainly Bordeaux varieties, with some Syrah.",50.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
35941,Korbel 2005 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"Marked by the crispness of the acidity, which makes for a tingly feeling on the tongue, this dry bubbly has citrus and yeast flavors.",16.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
35944,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
35947,Silver Stone Winery 2005 Merlot (San Luis Obispo County),"Dry and fruity, but a little brittle in tannins and acids, this Merlot has red currant, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak flavors. Drink now.",37.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
35953,Maryhill 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"For a $15 Washington Merlot, this offers fair value. Despite the earthy, slightly stemmy tannins, the wine has substantial fruit flavors of cranberry and pie cherry, and the acids give it some extra lift. This will go well with fatty meats and grilled steaks.",15.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
36394,Truchard 2005 Roussanne (Carneros),"Packs plenty of powerful complexity into a dry wine that's a pretty good price. Made in full-Burgundian style, with barrel fermentation and lees aging, it's a rich, creamy wine packed with spicy tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay.",20.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
36403,Seia 2005 Clifton Hill Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"A fine follow-up to Seia's inaugural 2004 Clifton Hill, this again delivers ripe, concentrated flavors of plum and berry, lifted with citrus and finishing with a hint of mint. Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface.",30.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
36546,Carr 2005 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Lush describes this Syrah. With a little bottle age, it's achieved a nice, creamy softness, and offers mouthwatering flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, ripe crushed blackberries and pepper. There's also a lot of oak, adding intricacies of caramel and sweet woodspice.",27.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
36549,Viansa 2005 Samuele Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),"The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine is decadently rich and forward in pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate, seasoned with anise, cinnamon and pepper. Firm tannins give much-needed structure to this deliciously dry Cab Franc.",55.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
36558,Schug 2005 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros),"You'll find tons of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, orange zest, chocolate and spice flavors in this dry wine, but it's no mere fruit store. With polished tannins and fine Carneros acidity, it achieves an elegant balance. Drink now.",35.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
36565,Cosentino 2005 Crystal Valley Cellars The Zin Zinfandel (California),"Lots of people will like this sweet young Lodi Zin for its jammy raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, and its tannins will cut through a sugary barbecue sauce. But if you're looking for something dry, go elsewhere.",30.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
36572,Covington 2005 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hard and tannic, this doesn't show much in the way of varietal character. There's a hint of red fruit, some tar and rubber, and a thin, somewhat stemmy finish.",29.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
36575,Hoodsport 2005 Cabernet Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very stiff and tannic, with hard, stemmy flavors and very little evidence of ripe fruit.",17.0,82,3,0.966990360015615

37185,Whitman Cellars 2005 Narcissa Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux blend (with some Syrah in the mix also) opens with dark, toasty, smoky scents underscoring sleek berry fruit. It's done in a somewhat lean style, but nicely balanced. Details of olive, tobacco, cedar and coffee run through the finish. The best Narcissa released so far.",24.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
37397,Domaine Carneros 2005 Le Rêve Sparkling (Carneros),"With this brut-style wine, Domaine Carneros competes against California's most serious sparkling wine contenders. It is certainly the finest Le Rêve ever, glamorous and provocative, massively flavored in lemon, lime and tangerine flavors, yet balanced and elegant, with the doughy tartness of Champagne. A great achievement.",90.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
38010,Sheldrake Point 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Blueberry and cherry on the nose and palate of this medium-bodied red are cheerful and likeable, though overall the wine lacks dimension. An enticing wave of pepper and spice adds to the package. A Cabernet Franc with personality.",17.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38011,Hopkins Vineyard 2005 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Western Connecticut Highlands),"This has all of the easygoing, good raspberry and blueberry flavors that a Cabernet Franc should. The nose is rich in raspberry and pepper, and on the palate, the wine has good structure and length. Pair with lasagna or a spiced meat dish for extra appeal.",20.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38012,Opaque 2005 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),"This wine illustrates why most vintners prefer to use Petit Verdot as a blender for its dark color, thick tannins and heavy mouthfeel. It can give weight and body to Cabernet or Merlot. The wine itself has dark, brooding flavors of black currants, tobacco and unsweetened baker's chocolate.",30.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38015,Atwater 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"This has a balance and elegance that recommends it above many New York wines of the same variety. An expressive nose of red berry, coffee, some spice leads into balanced, appetizing flavors of cherry and pepper with a smoky, rich edge. Dry and food-friendly, this has class.",24.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38018,Virgin 2005 Shiraz (California),"Made in an inexpensive Aussie style, this Shiraz is dry and rich in blackberry, currant, tobacco, Dr. Pepper, mocha and peppery spice flavors. At this price, it's great for barbecues.",10.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38024,Teresina 2005 Petite Sirah (Lodi),"Slow to air off a sulfury aroma, this finally revealed itself to be dry, soft and vigorous, with modest alcohol and deep flavors of black currants, blueberries, cocoa and grilled meat. And then there are the big-time tannins that are so large a part of Petite Sirah's personality.",20.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
38144,Heron Hill 2005 Old Vines Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lemon and mineral tones dominate and show more intensity and definition on the nose than the palate. Turns a bit tart on the finish. This is a wine that screams for raw oysters.,25.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
38376,Del Rio 2005 Merlot (Rogue Valley),"Don't look for density or any particular varietal focus here, but what you will find is a pleasing, soft, smooth wine with black cherry, licorice, smoke and chocolate. It's all front-loaded and fruit-driven, but if you want something to enjoy right now, preferably outdoors, with some butterfat in the soft, pliable tannins, this wine will deliver the goods.",28.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
38382,Sunstone 2005 Estate Reserve Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Wraps minty, pepper-infused cherry flavors into a very soft texture, giving a wine of considerable lushness and attraction. Right on the edge of the Merlot revolution going on in the warmer parts of Santa Ynez Valley, and a wine to watch.",52.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
38387,Melrose 2005 Merlot (Umpqua Valley),"Thick and chocolaty, this Umpqua Valley Merlot does not lack for flavor intensity. Plum jam, coffee and smoke whirl around the palate, well-matched to dark, ripe, chewy tannins.",22.0,87,3,0.966990360015615

38509,Lavender Ridge 2005 Cotes du Calaveras Red (Sierra Foothills),"A Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is softly attractive in spicy fruits and berries. The flavors are very ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and licorice.",18.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
38517,Lava Cap 2005 Matagrano Sangiovese (El Dorado),"This a single-vineyard wine is dry and high in acidity, with cherry, tobacco and tar flavors, and has a rustic mouthfeel. Think of it as American Chianti, and drink with roasted meats and hearty pasta dishes.",20.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
38521,White Oak 2005 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Easy to nail this as a Syrah because it's so peppery. Aside from that, it's also so ripe and fruity, it could be Cabernet, with juicy blackberry, cassis, cherry and chocolate flavors.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
38525,Portfolio 2005 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley),"This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%.",125.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
38606,Rancho Zabaco 2005 Monte Rosso Vineyard Toreador Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age.",60.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
38982,Roederer Estate 2005 L'Ermitage Brut Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"This impressive bubbly has apple, caramel and toffee aromas, melt-in-the-mouth Bosc pear and spice rack flavors, a rich but firm texture, and long finish. It possesses amazing liveliness, body and depth, and seems to reveal more nuances and freshness with each sip. While terrific to drink now, it can be cellared through at least 2020.",48.0,96,3,0.966990360015615
39109,Otis Kenyon 2005 Matchless Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Pun alert. Matchless might suggest a peerless wine, but then you notice that the label has been burnt, as if in a fire. The blend is roughly two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah, and the wine is broadly fruity in the Walla Walla style, with suggestions of cherry pie and berry jam. The finish has a rather chalky feel, with chewy tannins.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39113,Dashe Cellars 2005 Louvau Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Concentrated and intense, this Zin shows ultraripe blackberry, cherry, black raspberry, milk chocolate, coffee, Asian spice, anise and smoky vanilla flavors that linger long into the finish. It's big and brash, suggesting grilled ribs slathered with sweet barbecue sauce.",32.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39114,Dogwood 2005 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39115,Easton 2005 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Easton's estate Zin is big and lusty in blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a little on the superextracted, sweetly jammy side that emphasizes the fruit and pushes the wine's structural elements to the sideline. Could be an ager.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39118,Ghost Pines 2005 Merlot (Napa-Sonoma),"This is a new brand from Gallo, named after a vineyard the Louis M. Martini winery used to designate. It's a rich, sturdy Merlot, with a thick tannin structure, and shows forward flavors of cherries, black and red currants, licorice, blackberry tea, cola and spice. Not an ager, but impressive for its complexity.",23.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39121,Balletto 2005 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",21.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
39360,Iron Horse 2005 Classic Vintage Brut Sparkling (Green Valley),"A good brut-style wine, a little sweet in the dosage, but with sound acidity. The bubbles are scoury. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",33.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
39365,Sparkling Pointe 2005 Topaz Impérial Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Pale peach in color, this softly sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay smells sweetly of red apples and a hint of lanolin. There's a gentle sweetness upon entry that carries through the finish with a bright acidity and pleasant apple and pear notes.",33.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
39433,Miner 2005 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is a serious red wine, powerful and authoritative in Petite Sirah character, but be forewarned, it's pretty tannic, and nowhere near ready. That probably won't stop most folks from popping the cork now, and they'll like the blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors just fine withgrilled steaks and chops. But the wine will develop fascinating bottle complexities for many years.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
40108,Wente 2005 The Nth Degree Syrah (Livermore Valley),"The winemaking has a slightly Australian flavor, aging primarily in American oak and going into barrel while still fermenting, resulting in a fairly soft wine with good intensity and varietal character. Some slightly smoky, earthy notes and cured meat aromas give way to blackberry and cola flavors on the palate, finishing up with a hint of coffee. Drink now–2015.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
40113,Clos La Chance 2005 Crimson Topaz Meritage (Central Coast),"A good, rich Merlot-based Bordeaux blend. Its ripe, almost decadent red and black currant and carob flavors are balanced with an herbal earthiness and soft, fine tannins.",18.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
40229,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve Smith Orchard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The vineyard sits at nearly a half-mile in elevation, and you'll find true mountain concentration to the blackberry jam, black cherry, raspberry, licorice, pepper and molasses flavors. The alcohol is quite high, but the wine feels rich and balanced.",40.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
40318,JR Wine 2005 Cork Tree Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A polished, elegant Merlot, with good structure framing deep flavors of currants, carob, violets and anise. The thick tannins suggest a good steak. Now through 2009.",38.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
40328,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2005 Great Oak Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Pretty astringent in young tannins now, this Syrah has a tough, lockdown quality that suggests aging. You could have it with beef and barbecue, but it really wants three or four years of cellaring to start to mellow and show off the black currants and cherries.",38.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
40748,White Cottage 2005 Cabernet Franc (Howell Mountain),"Very beautiful red wine. Not too many Cab Francs are coming off this mountain. It's lighter in body, and more cherried, than your standard Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, but shows the same tough tannins. Yet it's not an ager. Drink now–2010, with steak or lamb, and decant.",50.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
40769,Schramsberg 2005 Crémant Demi-sec Sparkling (North Coast),"Sweet, with flavors of tropical citrus fruits, flowers, candied ginger, bread dough and spices. Feels a bit rustic. Made from a blend of Flora and Gewürztraminer.",38.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
41128,Milbrandt 2005 Traditions Merlot (Washington),"There's lots of flavor going on here for a modest price. It starts with sharp, well-defined red fruit, tight and acidic, but interesting and nuanced. There's a pretty fair streak of vanilla, which suggests some sort of oak chip treatment, but it fills out the middle and delivers the sort of flavors that many consumers will love.",15.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
41270,Castle Rock 2005 Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),"Good evocation of a cool-climate Petite Sirah, in all its fruity glory. Dry, crisp and dense in tannins, the flavors are of jammy blackberries, tobacco and plums, with a spicy finish.",12.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
41449,South Coast 2005 Wild Horse Peak Lone Boulder Ridge Syrah (South Coast),"Shows how ripe red wines get in the Temecula area, with juicy blackberry, cherry, cola, licorice, sweet cured tobacco and cinnamon spice flavors. The tannins are smooth and refined. Finishes a little on the sweet, candied side.",38.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
41457,Mazzocco 2005 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From a benchland vineyard, this Zin is riper than almost anything out there. Higher in alcohol, too, with an astounding 16.8%. That's almost Port—exactly what it tastes like, with caramelized blackberry berry, dark chocolate, and vanilla flavors.",36.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
42697,Comtesse Thérèse 2005 Traditional Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Wonderfully rich with lush dark chocolate and espresso notes, this is another lovely, highly drinkable Merlot from Comtesse Thérèse. There's a good amount of charred oak, but it's integrated seamlessly with concentrated black plum and berry flavors. The finish is long, and accented by pleasant astringency of walnut skins and tobacco.",18.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
42838,Huntington 2005 Hidden Hill Vineyard Syrah (Alexander Valley),"Deliciously gentle. Makes you wonder why more people don't drink Syrah. With a soft complexity, the wine houses lush flavors of cherries, plums, mocha and violets, accented with sweet, smoky oak.",32.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
42843,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2005 Ausonius Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This new Ausonius features a blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. At first it's rich, smoky, chocolaty and supple; moving toward a Napa style in its breadth and ripeness, but leavening that with Washington's bright acids. Pleasing hints of spice and herb are dappled in, and the wine is almost peppery as it weaves across the palate. The finish is clean and simple, leaving you wishing for just a bit more complexity.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
42845,Tsillan Cellars 2005 Bellissima Rossa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bellissima Rossa is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. The Cabernet Sauvignon is muscular and taut; blackberry and cassis, mineral and smoke come up as aromas, then follow as flavors. Good legs show the weight of the wine, which hits the palate tight and shows a bit of chalky acid, then opens into more lush milk chocolate barrel flavors.",28.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
43154,Prager 2005 Royal Escort Paladini Vineyard Port (Napa Valley),"There's some richness in this chocolate- and cherry-flavored wine, but it really falls off quickly, leading to a thin finish. Lacks the sweet concentration this winery's Port-style wines used to have.",72.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
43329,Gifford Hirlinger 2005 Stateline Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. It's bright and peppery and lightly herbal, with tart strawberry and cherry tomato flavors.",22.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
43701,Mandolina 2005 Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"Dry, acidic and harsh, this wine's cherry-skin flavors have a tannic bitterness. It tastes like an old-style Chianti, without the charm.",18.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
43703,Greg Norman California Estates 2005 Zinfandel (Red Hills Lake County),"Tastes very hot, with a high alcohol peppery burn. The flavors that come through are of mint and bitter cherries.",15.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
43713,Betz Family 2005 Le Parrain Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish.",85.0,96,3,0.966990360015615
44331,Robert Karl 2005 Inspiration Reserve Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This Bordeaux blend is a complex and sappy red with plenty of raspberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavor, tangy acids and ripe tannins. Young and tart, it is structured for age, compact and quite young. The oak brings in hints of butter and caramel.",48.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
44384,Mount Baker Vineyards 2005 Barrel Select Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack.",14.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
44482,Chimney Rock 2005 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.",78.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
44489,Helix by Reininger 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years.",30.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
44631,Fall Line 2005 Horse Heaven Hills Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Herb, spice, smoke and a whiff of roasted meat lead into a wine that is balanced and deep. This puts a focus on the dark side: black fruits, tar, coffee and smoke. It's grainy and tannic, and the tannins and toast may eventually outrun the fruit. But it's a good effort in a Washington style, that captures the black olive and herbal leanings of the Bordeaux grapes.",30.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
44636,Helix 2005 Pomatia Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Supple and scented with a sweet mix of fruit, coffee and mocha, this expressive red blend (53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 8% Cab Franc, 8% Syrah) tastes of bright black cherry fruit, coffee grounds, some grainy tannins and a long finish that brings in pepper, spice and chocolate. Very accessible and full-flavored, it is built for immediate drinking rather than cellaring.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45146,Pedroncelli 2005 Mother Clone Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This drily elegant Zin needs food to perk it up, especially lighter meats, like veal, pork or chicken. It's not full-bodied enough for beef, with flavors of cherries and tobacco that are almost Pinot-esque in their silky texture. Good value for its complexity.",14.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
45149,Vin Nostro 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows the lusty, rustic nature of Dry Creek Zins. There's an earthy, herbal component to the brambly blackberry and black raspberry fruit, with a sweet, spicy finish of olive tapenade and roasted figs. Great with sugar-based barbecue sauce on poultry or beef.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
45157,Four Vines 2005 Dusi Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Firmly on the rustic side, this Zin is hot and peppery. It's also slightly sweet and sour, with spicy flavors of soy sauce, mashed cherries and blackberries, candied ginger, balsamic vinegar and tabasco. This controversial wine, which hails from a famous old vineyard, will have its fans.",33.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
45166,Canoe Ridge 2005 Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From the estate vineyard, this classy, Merlot-driven blend has a good mix of berry, cherry, compost, green tea and tobacco scents and flavors. The acids are in good proportion to the fruit and tannins, and the wine keeps its focus and power into a lingering finish.",35.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
45168,Fall Line 2005 Red Mountain Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Fall Line makes its Bordeaux blends AVA-specific; here the focus is on Red Mountain, and the wine is composed of 42% Cab Franc, 29% Merlot and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon. An elegant wine, it shows refined tannins, mature fruit flavors, already light bricking and aromas of plump fruits, pie cherry and tobacco. Drink now.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
45177,Fidelitas 2005 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just the second Malbec from Fidélitas, this pure varietal bottling opens with deep, dark aromas of smoke, coffee and pepper, with saturated colors that seem to promise a dense, exotic wine. Though it is lively and offers nice flavors of pepper, berry and spice, it does not have the concentration in the mouth that the aromas suggest. There are some prickly herbal flavors, along with light chocolate, in the finish.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45180,Tangley Oaks 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A very nice, super-drinkable Merlot. Crisp in acids and tannins, it shows the fine structure and dryness that are missing in so many of today's California reds. The cherry, currant and oak flavors have an earthy grounding of tobacco and sage.",15.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45182,Morrison Lane 2005 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is Morrison Lane's first Dolcetto—previously these grapes were blended into the winery's Nebbiolo. The color is dark and saturated, the plummy fruit flavors laced with spice and leaf. There is a high acid sharpness on the tongue, with a little green character in the tannins, but it is a very promising first effort.",24.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45183,Paraduxx 2005 Red (Napa Valley),"From Duckhorn, a very serious producer, but this is their fun wine. Not to say this blend of Zin, Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc isn't a heavyweight red. It is, with massive berry, cherry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. But it seems designed for easier fare, such as barbecue. At its best over the next 5 years.",48.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45189,Hestia Cellars 2005 Meritage Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Meritage red blend is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc and 12% Malbec. The fruit flavors are pure and focused, and the wine opens beautifully with tangy boysenberry, plum and wild cherry. The acids carry it aloft, and the tannins, just slightly hinting at green tea, are polished and firm. Though it finishes with some herbal flavors, it is satisfying throughout.",40.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
45272,Hogue 2005 Terroir Andrews Vineyard Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills),"There's a lot of new oak in the nose, and it's tannic and has a fair amount of the volatile aromas that are found in several of the Hogue reds. The midpalate is soft to a fault, but shows hints of the spice and pepper of the grape. It finishes with volatility and unusually soft tannins. Tasting room exclusive.",25.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
45299,BOND 2005 Pluribus Red (Napa Valley),"Very polished and pure, if a bit direct and obvious in appeal. A beautiful wine, with pure flavors of currants and cedar. Drinkable now, and should hold through the decade.",275.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
45306,Chester Kidder 2005 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 5% Merlot; the fruit is sourced from vineyards scattered throughout eastern Washington. Velvety and supple, this is a modulated mix of bright, sassy blackberry and currant fruit, spiced up with the peppery highlights of Syrah. The effect is to move it solidly into the Australian camp, which makes perfect sense, for nowhere else in the New World do these two grapes sync up so well. Vanilla and espresso streaks enhance the finish.",50.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
45461,Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.",150.0,97,3,0.966990360015615
45464,BOND 2005 Melbury Red (Napa Valley),"Lots of fresh herbs and spices in this beautiful red wine. Offers loads of red and black currants and chocolate, with a fine application of cedar and cigar box from oak. Very fine, enormously likeable. Drink now through 2015.",275.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
45466,Harlan Estate 2005 Red (Napa Valley),"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.",450.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
45467,Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",200.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
45470,Flora Springs 2005 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"A drop-dead gorgeous red blend that continues Flora Springs' fine streak of Bordeaux-style wines. Full-bodied and dry, it's balanced and rich, with complex flavors of currants, minerals, cedar and spice. The tannins are strong, but ultra-refined. Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015.",65.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
45474,Beringer 2005 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Howell Mountain),"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.",75.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
45477,BOND 2005 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley),"Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy. Hard now, a bit austere, but beautifully structured, with a thick, currant-infused taste. Needs time.",275.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
45722,Morovino 2005 Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"The fruit is fading on this pale, silky wine, and the alcohol is showing through, giving heat to the red cherry, orange and cola flavors. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",24.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
45735,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2005 Jersey Girl Syrah (Paso Robles),"Delicious, if a little superripe, with chocolate and raisin-infused blackberry and cherry flavors. Feels soft and melted in the mouth, but dry, and the tannic structure is rewardingly plush.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
45737,Kasuari 2005 Rose Knoll Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This Zin is a little on the soft side, but it's very good, even charming in the way it flatters the palate with richness. Offers a burst of ripe blackberries, currants and pepper, wrapped into perfectly ripe Napa tannins. Drink now through 2010.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
45808,Novelty Hill 2005 Columbia Valley Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"If Washington “owns” Merlot as a category in the U.S. (not that anyone cares at the moment), this confirms it. You get ripe, sweet, tangy red berry fruit, fresh acids, ripe tannins and toasty oak; there may not be a better value in the country. The way the oak is used is magnificent and adds layer after layer to the extended finish.",22.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
45984,Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Sonoma Coast),"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.",70.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
45992,Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley),"This is one of the greatest Carneros sparkling wines in memory. It feels softly crisp and creamy in the mouth, with brilliant, complex flavors of limes, raspberries and vanilla, and yeasty, oak influenced notes of brioche. There's a richness throughout that's hard to put into words, but the palate understands.",70.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
46833,J Vineyards & Winery 2005 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"You can taste the dosage on this Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier brut in the overt sweetness that accompanies the pear, citrus and raspberry fruit flavors. With noticeable residual sugar, it's not really a dry sparkling wine, but it is delicious.",48.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
47129,Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah.",27.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
47132,Source Napa 2005 Heart Block Sauvignon Blanc (Yountville),"It was barrel-fermented, using wild yeasts, and aged on the lees. The vineyard is in the coolest part of Napa Valley, and in this cool vintage, acidity is the most important part of the wine. Crisp and biting, it lends structural authority to the Meyer lemon, lime, tangerine, fig, mineral, vanilla and white pepper flavors. The alcohol level has been kept to a modest 13.8%. A welcome addition to California's Sauvignon Blanc pantheon.",50.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
47134,Bella 2005 Lily Hill Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"If you want to understand the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zinfandal, taste this wine. It's absolutely classic. Shows the region's balance, power and elegance. From the wild blackberry, raspberry, fig and tangerine zest fruit, to the clove, white pepper and anise spices, to the fabulously rich tannic structure, this is great, world-class Zinfandel. The high alcohol feels absolutely natural.",36.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
47140,Novy 2005 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol.",27.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
47145,Robert Karl 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Washington Syrah at its most distinctive. The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean. This is a glorious food wine, but so juicy, assertive and delicious that it almost demands to be drunk on its own. Will it evolve in the cellar? Probably, but it's hard to keep your hands off it long enough to find out.",29.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
47148,Syncline 2005 Cuvée Elena Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourvèdre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah. Somehow winemaker James Mantone coaxes something akin to French garrigue out of the grapes as well, making this one of a handful of Washington Rhônes that really capture those elusive French herbal highlights.",35.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
47420,Madrigal 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a dry, stylish Merlot that will take a supporting role on the table, rather than trying to dominate it. It's fairly tannic but well-structured, with subtle flavors of dried cherries, red currants, pepper and violets. Drink now.",30.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
47421,Matanzas Creek 2005 Merlot (Bennett Valley),"Lots of richness in this smoky young Merlot. You'll find detailed flavors of grilled blackberries, red and black cherry preserves, leather, anise and cedar. It's a finely structured, dry wine whose tannins will work against rosemary-scented broiled lamb chops.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
47429,Ca' del Solo 2005 Nebbiolo (Monterey County),"Much more acidic than most other California red wines, this Nebbiolo seems designed to cut through rich meats, tomato sauce and cheese. It has strong flavors of cherries, with the tannic skins, and additional earthy notes of coffee and tar. Will age for many years.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
47491,Prager 2005 Imogene's Vineyard Tomas Port (Napa Valley),"Enormously sweet, with sugared blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that are frankly delicious. Nice as a nighttime winter apéritif, with some chocolaty confection and a roaring fire.",52.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
47493,Spellbound 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"A great example of Lodi Zin, at a great price. Shows real complexity in the blackberry, cherry, mulberry, molasses, cocoa and cola flavors, accented with exotic dusty spices. For all the richness, it's totally dry, and the alcohol level is refreshingly low.",15.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
47690,Sunstone 2005 Eros Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Bordeaux blend from Sunstone has been getting softer, sweeter and more melted over the years. This latest bottling is almost like a dessert wine, with pastry-like cherry, currant, cocoa, anise and vanilla flavors. It lacks structure and full dryness.",52.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
47703,Bellangelo 2005 Francesca Rossa Red (Finger Lakes),"This Bordeaux-style red starts promisingly, with a big nose of smoky meat, tobacco and pepper, but on the palate, there's a slightly rubbery edge and the fruit needs more complexity. Tannins are good. In the right direction but not quite hitting the mark.",13.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
47704,Leonesse Cellars 2005 Cabernet Franc-Merlot Red (Temecula),"Sweet and soft as syrup, this cherry-berry flavored wine has a smoky overlay of vanilla-accented oak.",34.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
47708,Redtree 2005 Zinfandel (California),"Tastes uneven, with sweet, jammy cherry and blackberry flavors side by side with minty, green ones. Rustic, but at this price, it's okay for a big party.",8.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
47791,Krupp Brothers 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Veraison Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"Fleshy and ripe, with blackberry and currant flavors just beginning to turn the curve from primary fruit and cocoa to bottle bouquet. Picking up notes of dried fruits and dried flowers. Yet the tannins are still firm and acidity still cuts across the middle. A little unbalanced but interesting. Now–2012.",60.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
48046,Lost River 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Barrel scents of smoke and bacon fat cover blackberry fruit, and lead into a thick, toasty wine designed to win friends. It's forward and bright, with pretty fruit flavors of strawberry, black cherry and more. The oak flavors are generous and lush, complementing the tart, acidic snap of the fruit.",22.0,88,3,0.966990360015615

48344,Sebastiani 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Harsh and dry, this Merlot has bitter cherry flavors with an edge of green unripeness. As a result the acidity is sharp.",17.0,81,3,0.966990360015615

48868,Wellington 2005 Meeks Hilltop Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This rustic Zin is meant to wash down grilled meats, hard cheeses and tomato-based pasta dishes. It's very dry and a bit hot in high alcohol, with a peppery edge and firm, rasping tannins.",24.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

48871,Kendall-Jackson 2005 Vintner's Reserve Merlot (California),"A pretty good everyday Merlot, made from all-coastal grapes, not from the Central Valley.

48898,Lake Sonoma 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Lake Sonoma produces varietally pure wines at fair prices. This is a solid Zin, rich and spicy, with cherry-berry and cocoa fruit flavors framed in brisk, fine tannins. Will hold for up to six years.",17.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
48907,Mill Creek 2005 Corner Pocket Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
49047,Palmer 2005 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Bold and brawny, the Palmer Merlot offers up convincing scents of mulberries and vanilla backed up by a palate that's both juicy and gripping.

49073,Keuka Spring 2005 Epic Reserve Red (Finger Lakes),"The nose on this wine starts a bit grape-jelly clunky, but on the palate, an appealing balance of fruit, pepper, oaky spice and minerals triumphs. The wine has class and structure and will be great paired with grilled meat or richer dishes.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
49091,Sbragia 2005 Gino's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Salty and peppery, this is a rustic Zinfandel, powered by briary, brambly notes.

49423,Sunstone 2005 Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),"Too many California Sangiovese suffer from all sorts of problems, mainly unripeness. But this one is soft and smooth and juicy.

49429,Bradford Mountain 2005 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Young, thick in the mouth, and sweet in briary fruit, this Syrah could be a sleeper. It's really too jammy now, with its wealth of cherries, berries, currants, chocolate and pepper. Unless you like this kind of immediate fruity pleasure, give it a sleep in the cellar. Better after 2009.",34.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
49430,Longevity 2005 Red (Central Coast),"This is a Rhône blend based on Syrah and Grenache.

Drink now.",28.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
49677,Lynmar 2005 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"This is from a cool, southeastern corner of the large Sonoma Coast AVA. In this cool vintage, you can taste the fog in the crisp acids and dense tannins. Not a fruit bomb like so many others. Instead, a very dry, serious Syrah that requires patience. Such is the action-packed core of blackberries and currants that this wine should evolve over the next decade.",36.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
49686,Sausal 2005 Century Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.",35.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
50029,Newton 2005 Unfiltered Merlot (Napa Valley),"Bone dry and pretty tannic at the age of four-plus years, this Merlot has interesting flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak.

50447,Saviah 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Once again, the amazing Stillwater Creek vineyard comes through with a highly expressive, pure and intense Syrah that captures the heart and soul of a Washington State take on the grape.

50482,Cosentino 2005 The Poet 20th Anniversary Meritage (Napa Valley),"Super-fruity, with a fantastic range of blackberry, cherry, currant, blueberry, chocolate and anise flavors. Could be firmer in structure, though, as the texture is overly soft and melted.",75.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
50537,JC Cellars 2005 Arrowhead Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Very rich and juvenile now, with exotic cherry, blackberry, gingerbread, tangerine, herb tea, vanilla oak and spice flavors, this Zin has a thick, tannic intensity that needs time to mature. The power and concentration must come from the mountain vineyard, on the eastern side of the valley. Hold this dramatic, high-alcohol Zinfandel until mid-2008, at least.",35.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
50826,Ravenswood 2005 Pickberry Vineyards Merlot (Sonoma Mountain),"This is a Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend grown in the little appellation of Sonoma Mountain.

Despite the tannins, it has a softness that makes it drinkable now.",50.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
51054,The Grapes of Roth 2005 Merlot (Long Island),"Big and brooding with richly concentrated black plums and velvety, mouthfilling tannins, Roman Roth's namesake Merlot is boldly structured, but beautifully nuanced as well, with sprays of violet perfume and just a whiff of wet, earthy forest and dried herb notes. Drink now with a good decant, or hold for another 2–3 years.",50.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
51177,Rancho Zabaco 2005 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",45.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
51186,A.S. Kiken 2005 Red Table Wine Red (Diamond Mountain District),"This is sort of a second wine from Reverie. It's rustic and sharp, with tart, jellied blackberry and cherry flavors. Not going anywhere.",40.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
51187,Raymond 2005 R Collection Merlot (California),"A little on the sweet side, with some raw tannins that bring the wine down from elegant to country-style. One-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon brings a blackberry note to the cherry and vanilla flavors.",15.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
51189,Shippey 2005 Rocking Z Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The official alcohol on this wine is 14.9%, but it has a syrupy concentration and heat that tastes far higher than that. Was it watered down? Tastes like cherry and blackberry wine that was reduced for a sauce, with a thick, balsamic finish.",24.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
51202,Naggiar 2005 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Soft and rather vague in character, this average quality wine has modest cherry-berry, chocolate and sweet vanilla flavors. Drink now.",27.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
51709,Waters 2005 Loess Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Smelling of pure Syrah, annotated with rock and white pepper, this is graceful, muscular and compact.

51712,Prospect 772 2005 The Brawler Syrah-Viognier (Calaveras County),"Mainly Syrah, with a little splash of Viognier, this opulent, sensual wine floods the mouth with flavors of blackberry and blueberry pie filling, chocolate-raspberry truffle, red licorice, black pepper, clove and vanilla oak.

51714,Michael Florentino Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is reminiscent of the best Glen Fiona Syrahs from the Rusty Figgins era. It's 100% varietal from the Lonesome Springs Vineyard, quite dark and spicy with sweet berry fruit. Consistent stylistically with the other releases from Michael Florentino Cellars, this adds interesting details of white pepper and baking spices. Forward, fleshy, appealing, delicious and well-made.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
51717,The Winemaker's Loft 2005 Red Table Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of 60% Cabernet, 20% Merlot, 18% Syrah and splashes of Malbec, Zinfandel and Tempranillo, this spicy and toasty red wine shows the care that went into the original barrels, which were never intended for this inexpensive tasting room red. The fruit is juicy and bursting with bright sweet berry flavors, and the generous oak adds cinnamon and butterscotch.",13.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
51718,Toogood 2005 Petite Sirah (El Dorado),"Cabernet-philes who want to experiment with Petite Sirah will find this a rewarding entry wine. It shows the variety's firm, punchy tannins, full-bodied muscularity, and deeply extracted black currant, plum, carob, coffee, pepper and cedar flavors that are powerful and long-lasting. Yet beyond the brawn is elegance and finesse. Drink now through 2010.",24.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
52083,Doyenne 2005 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is an aromatic, smoky, herbal and ultimately captivating Syrah. Dense, smoky, tarry and herbal, it is a serious effort from a winery that specializes in the grape. The fruit is a juicy mix of wild berries, cassis and black cherry, with substantial tannins that add herbal, green tea flavors. Give it time to smooth out in the glass and notice how the finish runs on and on into a lovely dénouement of Provençal herb, black olive and spice.",48.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
52086,OS Winery 2005 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills),"This excellent red is 75% Cabernet Franc, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

52087,OS Winery 2005 Dineen Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Dark, sappy and syrupy, this jet-black, 100% Syrah mixes superconcentrated raspberry compote with espresso, smoke and hints of pepper bacon. There is nothing shy here, but the wine is authoritative and splashy, a Syrah that does not taste like all the other Syrahs made in Washington. Despite alcohol levels just under 15% the wine keeps its shape and its detail, and the tannins are smooth and polished. A fine effort from winemaker Bill Owen.",42.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
52090,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Walla Walla Vintners' signature wine, and it is a classic: rich and oaky, sculpted but also chewy, with big cherry and baking chocolate flavors. There is an unusual flavor streak running through that tastes a bit like Thanksgiving turkey, believe it or not, but it's good. Tannins are polished and the toffee and chocolate finish ends things on a sweet and creamy note.",25.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
52094,Cadence 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Fragrant and liquorous, this opens with scents of berry and cherry and spice, lightly lifted with floral accents. The wine is a pretty ruby color, and it walks the line between open and closed, poised right on the fence. There is a sharp spicy streak, which wraps into the graphite and mineral character of the vineyard.",40.0,90,3,0.966990360015615

The tannins are a pleasing mix of light herb and moist earth, and there is a finishing kiss of chocolate wafer.",34.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
52120,Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Von Weidlich Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"When Russian River Zinfandel succeeds, and this one does, it marries the variety's wild, feral personality to the valley's perfect terroir to produce distinctive wines. Ottimino's 2005 Von Weidlich is very tannic, but classic in presentation, showing blackberry, currant and intense black pepper aromas and flavors. Might tempt you to cellar it, but it's best over the next year for sheer exuberance.",36.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
52121,Pirouette 2005 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The newest vintage of Long Shadows Pirouette is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 5% Malbec and 4% Cab Franc. Combined with the benefits of a stellar vintage, this is substantial, textural and  complex. The toasty new oak flavors are more than matched by rich layers of berries, cassis and black cherries. It glides into a seductive midpalate, adding flavors of dusty cocoa, espresso liqueur and toasted grain. It would show quite well against California Meritage-style wines costing twice as much.",55.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
52125,Kunde 2005 Shaw Vineyard Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Locked down by hard tannins, this nonetheless is a beautiful Zinfandel, dry and rich in flavor.

52157,Ehrhardt 2005 Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),"A very nice wine, low in alcohol but strong in flavor, with a light, silky mouthfeel. With tart, dry flavors of Meyer lemons, figs and minerals, it's a good alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",12.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
52162,Bray 2005 Alicante Bouschet (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Very dry, with tough, astringent tannins, this wine may develop with some years in the cellar. It has a good heart of cassis. If you drink it now, give it serious decanting.",19.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
52386,Leaping Lizard 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Leaping Lizard is turning out good value wines that show true varietal character.

52402,Abacela 2005 Petit Verdot (Southern Oregon),"This is the winery's first bottling of this Bordeaux blending grape It is a curiosity that will be of interest to those in search of the unique and rare, but this does not convince me that the grape should be the centerpiece of a varietal wine. There's tangy, plummy fruit, searing acids and very astringent tannins. But the wine is incomplete—there's no middle.",40.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
52439,Dierberg 2005 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is a sumptuous, delicious Syrah, marked by very ripe fruit, but also by a wonderfully complex balance.

52526,Lolonis 2005 Winegrower Selection Chase Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),"A problematic wine. It starts out with an inert aroma that's mainly caramelized wood.

53049,Columbia Crest 2005 Two Vines Shiraz (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Straightforward, this offers thin, tart fruit with excessive vanilla and tobacco flavors. There's no residual sugar, but otherwise it's right out of the Australian playbook.",8.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
53108,Tejada 2005 Reserve Tempranillo- Garnacha (Lake County),"An interesting wine, and kudos to Tejada for tackling such an unusual blend.

53838,Red Newt Cellars 2005 Viridescens Red (Finger Lakes),"This ambitious, impressively structured wine will appeal to those who run from wines made in the fruit-bomb style.

53857,Ventosa 2005 Saggio Red (New York),"The high percentage of Cabernet Franc makes itself known in this wine with tobacco leaf and tomato skin aromas on the nose.

54214,Novy 2005 Stolpman Vineyard Nebbiolo (Santa Ynez Valley),"Tannins are what help great Italian Nebbiolo age for many years, and this Santa Barbara expression of the variety is loaded with tannins. So much so that they lock down the palate with fierce astringency. So is it an ager? There's a polished depth of cherry and leather flavor, but it may not be enough for the long haul. Call it a work in progress.",33.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
54405,St. Amant 2005 Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Lodi),"Either there's some residual sugar or the high alcohol, 15.8%, gives this wine a sweet taste, or both. Either way, it tastes like liquified raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, with a squeeze of chocolate syrup. One-third new oak adds caramel and butterscotch.",28.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
54407,Black Bart 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"The vineyard has had a mixed record of producing reds, usually expensive, not always great. This Syrah is too sugary sweet, with jammy berry and fruit flavors and lots of caramelly oak.",65.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
54408,Hahn 2005 Cabernet Franc (Central Coast),"Call it country-style, with the minty sharpness and slightly sweet, candied raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. The acidity reprises on the finish, accentuating and harshening the tannins.",20.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
54473,Estrella Creek 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Tastes old, tired and vegetal, with modest berry flavors. It's also too soft and sweet. The alcohol seems higher and hotter than the official reading of 14.3%.",29.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
54560,Parkers Estate 2005 Dillon Springs Road Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A good, ripe Zinfandel that really needs food to wake it up. By itself, it's a little aloof, with firm tannins and acids hiding black currant, pepper and tobacco flavors. Better with cheeses, barbecue, pizza.",15.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
55186,Pozo Valley 2005 Zinfandel (San Luis Obispo County),"Made country-style, this Zin is dry, medium-bodied and crisply acidic, with simple flavors of mashed cherries, raspberries and coffee. Nice with Italian fare.",21.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
55193,Wilson 2005 Ellie's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Wilson's red wines tend to be simple and forward in sweet, sugary fruit, and so is this wine. It shows jammy or pie-filling flavors of raspberries, cherries and currants.",35.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
55317,Glenora 2005 Brut Méthode Champenoise  (Finger Lakes),"While briskly composed, this delicately bubbly blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir envelops the palate with a flurry of delicate foam. Late disgorged, it highlights flavors of pressed apples, pears and the faintest hint of brioche. Drink now.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
55528,Vice Versa 2005 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This very rich, unctuous Syrah is immature and not especially subtle at this time. It's acidic and gooey in jammy blackberries and cherries and milk chocolate, with obvious oak influences. The idea seems to be ageworthiness, but that's a gamble. Could surprise.",65.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
55785,Barlow 2005 Barrouge Red (Napa Valley),"This is Barlow's Bordeaux blend. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's a beautiful wine, dry and balanced and fully ready to drink now, although it will take some years of cellaring. With fine acidity and tannins, it displays elegant flavors of currants and cassis, with rich edges of mocha and cedar.",40.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
55954,Sterling 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This least expensive of Sterling's latest Merlots stands up respectfully beside the winery's more expensive bottlings, which makes it a good buy. It's very dry, tannic and elegantly structured, with cherry and blackberry flavors enriched with sweet smoky oak.",22.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
56003,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA)),"No information on blending was provided by the winery; this does not show typical character of truly varietal Grenache. Rather, it falls into the category of mutt wine; a ready-to-drink, nondescript red with a stiff, herbal, earthy finish.",26.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
56006,Zerba Cellars 2005 Wild Z Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot, Cabernet, Syrah, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Barbera are tossed into the blend. The result is a rather generic mish-mash, pleasant but unfocused, that turns vegetal and stemmy in the finish.",19.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
57263,Milbrandt 2005 Legacy Merlot (Washington),"There's a ton of dark, chocolaty toast atop the succulent fruit in this tasty Merlot. The spicy plum and black cherry flavors carry hints of sweet tobacco and chocolate cake. Though not a massive wine, its broad flavors are full and engaging.",25.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
57474,Lachini 2005 Il Mulinello Red (Red Mountain),"Rough, round and ravishing, this is a rock ‘n' roll red that takes no prisoners. The Klipsun/Red Mountain tannins and power are there in abundance, but the edges have been smoothed, the balance is perfect, and the fruit is pure and expressive. This wine resonates out from a core of pure cherry/berry; it lingers and expands into a lush rainbow of strawberry and earth.",45.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
57711,Tagaris 2005 Red Roan Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This rich and round, Rhône Ranger red is loaded with fruit. The flavors pile on, one after another, beginning with citrus, banana and orange, and moving into berry and cherry and currant. It's underscored with moderate acidity and hints of pepper and tea.",30.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
57727,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This Syrah has a lovely mouthfeel, with soft, plush tannins, clean acids and a dry, balanced finish. The flavors are of black currants, roasted meat, violets, anise and crushed black pepper. Has some green notes, but it's a nice glass of wine.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
57753,Sherwood House Vineyards 2005 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Spicy, sweet red plums and charred oak marry well in this limited release wine from Sherwood House. There are hints of tobacco leaf and green grass throughout, but soft, supple tannins and a dark, smoky finish make this a pleasant sip.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
57807,Kynsi 2005 ZB Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"A huge disappointment, coming after the previous two vintages. This '05 is Porty sweet and sharp in acids, with extreme, medicinal flavors of blackberry jam and raisins.",46.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
58148,Rosenblum 2005 Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Another new Rosenblum release and as usual, there is a sweet, sugary edge to the cherries, blackberries and chocolate, although very high acidity helps keep the mouthfeel lively. The official alcohol is 14.8%, but there is something ruby Porty going on.",45.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
58557,Tyrus Evan 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"The fruit comes from the Seven Hills vineyard, on the Oregon side of the Walla Walla AVA. The fruit flavors are an intriguing mix of black cherry, plum and bourbon-soaked fig; there's nothing shy here. What is especially noteworthy is that winemaker Ken Wright has crafted a Syrah that is distinctively different from others that are using this fruit; it's more stylized, the fruit more precise, the barrel flavors more advanced.",40.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
58904,DeLille 2005 Harrison Hill Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"The Harrison Hill vineyard has some of Washington's oldest Cabernet vines. Here the blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot offers a distinctive flavor profile, clean, sharp and herbal, with an interesting, earthy note. Flavors mingle beautifully, and carry through from the tart, tight-knit red fruit into the polished and lightly slatey tannins and a chewy, lightly peppery finish.",72.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
58907,Fidelitas 2005 Boushey Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"Merlot comprises 53% of the blend, Cabernet Sauvignon 40%, and Cab Franc fills in the final 7%. Well built and satisfyingly complete, this tribute to grower Dick Boushey uses fruit from his oldest (25-year) vines. Scents of toast, mint and moist earth introduce varied fruit flavors of boysenberry, purple grape, cherry and plum. It's a big, bold wine that segues neatly into a finish of chocolate and butterscotch.",50.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
58914,JM Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright and spicy, this delightful Syrah has the cherry and boysenberry flavors, and the spice and lift of Washington fruit, with a finish that leads gracefully into pepper and coffee grounds. It's lively and palate-cleansing, with a finish that mixes citrusy lemon with dry, herbal tannins.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
58918,Spring Valley Vineyard 2005 Frederick Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The Frederick—a Bordeaux blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot—is entirely estate-grown, as are all of the Spring Valley wines. Located north of Walla Walla, in rolling wheat country, the vines attain a different set of flavors than anywhere else in the valley. It's an unusual combination of power (15.5% alcohol) and breed. Supple, sleek, mixing its black fruits with streaks of gun metal, iron and pencil lead, this is a wine that wants to tackle a prime rib, mano à mano.",50.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
58921,Trinitas 2005 Old Vine Mataro (Contra Costa County),"Mataro is another name for Mourvèdre. The wine tastes like a good Zinfandel, very dry, not too alcoholic, with savory, black pepper-infused flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, gingersnap cookie, and sweet leather. The feeling in the mouth is just fine, a smooth, full-bodied caress of sturdy tannins and brisk acidity.",28.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
59184,C.G. di Arie 2005 Southern Exposure Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Soft, dry and drinkable now, with firm, hearty tannins supporting ripe blackberry jam, dark chocolate, tobacco and mint flavors.",35.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
59185,C.G. di Arie 2005 Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Utterly delicious, with blackberry and cherry pie, chocolate health bar and caramelly wood flavors. But for the price, there's little in the way of tannin-acid structure, and flavor isn't enough for balance.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
59190,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2005 Carignane (Mendocino County),"Soft and sweet, with rough tannins, this is the kind of wine described as rustic, which Carignane usually is. It's rich in blackberries and chocolate, and will probably last for many years, but will never be a great wine.",20.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
59198,Kiona 2005 Lemberger (Red Mountain),"From old vines planted in 1975, this is one of the last of the Lemberger plantings from the early days of Washington viticulture. Nice blackberry fruit is washed in tannins and lightly oaked; a simple, satisfying pizza wine.",12.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
59934,Northwest Totem Cellars 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Chandler Reach vineyards supplied the fruit. This is tart, opening with sharp berry flavors and lots of citrus, then settling into a moderately long finish that brings in a mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. It's simple but ready to go.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
60214,Ampelos 2005 Byron Vineyard Delta Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),"Noteworthy for lush, slightly sweet flavors of mashed black cherries, espresso and dark chocolate, this gooey Grenache is from a well-known vineyard. It's smooth as velvet, with a polished mouthfeel. The alcohol is very high, but the wine handles it well.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
60215,B Cellars 2005 Blend 25 Red (Napa Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing.",49.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
60221,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah have been added to the blend, perhaps to amp up the color and cut the acids. This has pretty toast and strawberry tartness, light and lively. The finish hints at green pepper and herb.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
60225,Bergevin Lane 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a sweet and round and forward Merlot, at least upon entry. Then it takes a right angle turn, adding more astringent flavors of rock and earth and green tea. It's not quite Jekyll & Hyde, but it's not entirely pulled together. It needs a substantial piece of grilled meat to help soften those finishing tannins.",27.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
60226,Canoe Ridge 2005 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Surprising scents of clover and mint rise up from the glass, leading into a round, fruity, substantial wine with good cherry fruit and some earthy tannins from the 5% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has not completely knit together, but a good steak could fix that.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
61240,Spring Valley Vineyard 2005 Uriah Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Purple and black fruits spread across the midpalate, with herbal, tannic flavors from the Franc and floral highlights from the PV. There is a bit of a hole in the middle, and the tannins seem to hit a bit hard following that drop-off. It could be a phase, or it could be a failing.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
61248,Ash Hollow 2005 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is the winery's first varietal Malbec. Estate grown at the Bella Terra vineyard, it's an exciting debut, with floral scents over vivid purple fruit, and residual flavors of cured meat, smoke and pepper. About 14% Petit Verdot has been added to the blend.",36.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
61249,Bedell 2005 Musée Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This elegant red blend—the new flagship wine from Bedell—starts with a soft, juicy nose with hints of cedar and cinnamon. On the palate, a burst of cherry, plum and blackberry flavors mingle with spice and smooth tannins. The finish has an appealing spin of exotic spices. Though ready to drink now, the wine will benefit from a few years in the cellar, allowing its elements to even further integrate.",65.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
61349,Peterson 2005 Bradford Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is an enormously fruity Zinfandel that offers a flood of flavor, making it instantly likeable. Dry, full-bodied and tannic, it's powerful in briary blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, anise, pepper and cinnamon, with an edge of sweet, smoky oak and cocoa. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.",32.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
61531,Dunham 2005 Lewis Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Eric Dunham's Lewis vineyard Syrah belongs near the top of anyone's list of the best in the country. The brilliant nose opens with bright, inviting raspberry, blueberry and boysenberry scents and flavors. The wine is forward, intense and nuanced. Immediately, brilliantly appealing, it has the power and balance to age for up to a decade.",75.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
61665,S. P. Drummer 2005 Blair Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Some wines taste uptown and restaurant quality just because they're so clean, balanced and complex. This blend of the two Cabernets is one of those. In its rich power, it brings to mind the wonderful 1999, although it actually costs less. Combines lush blackberry and black currant flavors with impeccably fine tannins, in a wine that should age for a good eight years.",39.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
61922,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2005 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District),"An impressive young Bordeaux blend, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, that shows impeccably ripe, clean fruit but also the hard tannins of its famous mountain. Thoroughly dry, its astringency cannot mask an eruption of blackberries and black currants, accented by smoky oak. Give this lovely wine a good five years to begin to mature.",100.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
62047,St. Supéry 2005 Estate Bottled Merlot (Napa Valley),"A good Merlot that shows a fine structure, without much complexity. The wine is dry and tannic and soft, with blackberry, black cherry, plum and oak flavors. Ready now.",25.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
62550,Scheid Vineyards 2005 Reserve Claret Red (Monterey),"Youthfully fruity now, with sweet, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla oak and spices. Comes from the warm, southern part of Salinas Valley. Could develop, but it's a gamble.",55.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
62876,Barrister 2005 Artz Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"Spicy and a little hot right after opening, this wine breathes into shape, firming up with classic Red Mountain fruit flavors of plum and cherry, laced with graphite and accented with new oak. This is as muscular and authoritative as Merlot can get, and priced at a third of what comparablebottles from California cost.",25.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
62889,Bergevin Lane 2005 Intuition Reserve Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Textured, spicy and exotically scented with red and black fruits, pepper, ground coffee, cinnamon, saffron and chocolate powder. It's a delightful and complex wine, just under 15% alcohol, balanced and showing lots of plummy fruit that is backed with polished tannins and natural acids.",55.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
62981,Vie Winery 2005 L'Intruse Mourvèdre (Santa Barbara County),"Made from a warmer inland area, and blended with some Syrah and Grenache, this is a soft, fruity wine that offers immediate pleasure. It floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, chocolate, leather and coffee flavors that finish in a sprinkling of cinnamon, white pepper and nutmeg.",39.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
62995,Phipps 2005 Sonoma County Ranches Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"With 10% Petite Sirah, which seems to give it a tannic essence of dark fruit intensity, this Zin is enormous in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with cola and caramel notes. It's full-bodied and dry and, once again, those tannins are center-stage.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
63431,Columbia Crest 2005 Walter Clore Private Reserve Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The finest Walter Clore since the 2001, this Bordeaux-style blend shows considerable muscle and depth. Built upon firm, cherry-berry fruit, it adds nuances of baking spice, pepper, vanilla wafer and a pleasing earthiness to the tannins. It represents the ultimate expression of Columbia Crest, and the 2005 marks a welcome return to excellence.",34.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
63447,Dunham 2005 Double River Estate Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This unusual wine, from Dunham's estate vineyard, is dark and shows Rhône-like flavors of blood and cured meats. The fruit is tart—wild berry and cranberry flavors just on the edge of herbal, but laden with grace notes of herb, mineral and coffee. It's a pleasure to taste a Washington Syrah with this complexity at a very French (13%) level of alcohol.",65.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
63566,Mathis 2005 Grenache (Sonoma Valley),"Soft and fruity in the modern style, this Grenache has appealing red cherry and mocha flavors dusted with cinnamon and vanilla. It finishes sweet, like a Starbucks drink.",35.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
63592,Bella 2005 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Bella has a spotty record with this wine. The '05, from a cooler vintage, shows a Northern Rhône dryness and peppery taste, with good blackberry and currant flavors. But the tannins are very hard, almost old-fashioned in the way they shut the palate down.",38.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
63599,Swedish Hill 2005 Optimus Red (Finger Lakes),"Spicy red fruit and pepper lead on this Bordeaux blend from the Finger Lakes, and lively fruit flavors follow. Tannins, acid and oak are balanced and attractive, and the finish has length and structure. Overall, a wine with poise.",25.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
63635,Rubicon Estate 2005 Blancaneaux White (Rutherford),"The '05, as befits a cool vintage, is lean, with the alcohol showing through bare-bones citrus flavors. Even those who like their whites dry and flinty may find this Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier blend a little thin.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
63682,Sausal 2005 Century Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.",35.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
63967,Amicus by X Winery 2005 Special Blend Red (Spring Mountain District),"Good and delicious, but so ripe, soft and oaky, whatever terroir that Spring Mountain contributed has largely been obscured. With lip-smacking black currant, chocolate and anise flavors, the wine is made in an anonymous international style.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
64292,Magistrate 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Dry and a little sharp, with blackberry, currant, mocha, tea and herb flavors. The tannic astringency really needs rich grilled meats to balance it.",12.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
64317,Whitehall Lane 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a really good Merlot from a producer that does a great job at it and has kept prices fair for years. It shows the rich tannic structure that Napa so effortlessly achieves, while the great vintage ripened the grapes to blackberry and cherry perfection. Luscious now and for a couple more years.",28.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
64490,Bella 2005 Big River Ranch Syrah (Alexander Valley),"Hard tannins, probably from the grape skins, mark this wine, the kind you usually don't find in a Syrah, especially one from a warm climate like Alexander Valley. Beyond the lockdown astringency, you'll find lush blackberry and cocoa flavors, but they may not last long enough for the wine to age.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
64503,Terlato 2005 Devils' Peak Red (Napa Valley),"Superextracted in jammy fruit, this Bordeaux blend has flavors of cherries, blackberries, licorice, mocha and peppery spices. It's very rich, and probably at its best now and for a couple of years.",50.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
64754,Alienor 2005 Red (Lake County),"Good and dry, but awkward, with slightly vegetal flavors sticking through riper ones of blackberries and black currants. The acid-tannin relationship also is unbalanced. Redeems itself on the finish, with a flourish of chocolate.",65.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
64757,Dutch Henry Winery 2005 Argos Hill Red (Napa Valley),"There's something old-fashioned about this wine, in its strong, edgy tannins and rustic mouthfeel. Yet it's high and hot in alcohol, with extracted, jammy cherry and raisin flavors. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink now.",44.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
64914,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a nicely balanced, tightly constructed effort, a Merlot that will surprise anyone who has not tasted Washington Merlot in this price range. It is miles apart from the herbal, stemmy Merlots of other New World regions, or the vapid, watery $15 junk that comes from our neighbor to the south. This is ripe, full, meaty, structured, laden with plum and cherry, spice and just a hint of herb.",16.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
65381,Naches Heights 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From a very high altitude vineyard, this solidly built Syrah is soft and saturated with dark fruits. It has an earthy base and a broad midpalate, that lasts well but could use just a bit more focus. This is the first Syrah from this young vineyard, and it's definitely headed in the right direction.",18.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
65388,V. Sattui 2005 Crow Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.",29.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
65650,Ahlgren 2005 Bates' Ranch Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This Cab Franc is considerably lighter in body than a Cabernet Sauvignon. Its silky texture frames red cherry, red currant, red licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors that finish very dry. It's a lovely wine of some charm, but give it a decant before serving.",28.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
66042,Mettler Family Vineyards 2005 Petite Sirah (Lodi),"A pure expression of California, this Petite Sirah is soft as velvet, and explosively seductive in very ripe blackberry and cherry jam, violet, anise, cocoa and smoky vanilla flavors. It's a simple wine, but a very delicious one.",25.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
66054,O'Brien 2005 Seduction Red (Napa Valley),"Firm in tannins, this Bordeaux blend was grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District of the valley. Along with the astringency, it shows very ripe, sweetly jammy flavors of black cherries, currants and licorice. Could improve with cellaring.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
66708,Michael Florentino Cellars 2005 Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Zin is cut with 15% Syrah, a nice choice. Smooth and plummy and loaded with spice cake flavors, it's a moderate 13.5% alcohol—light for Zin—but has plenty of oomph in the mouth, ripe fruit and a pleasing chocolaty finish. Great presence and polish  elevate this well above the ordinary.",36.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
66712,Andrew Rich 2005 Mésalliance Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This classic Washington blend is 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Syrah—a perfect storm of power, precision and compact fruit. From the Merlot comes a thickly generous layer of strawberry/black cherry fruit. The Franc beefs up the tannins and adds highlights of coffee grounds, while the Syrah lifts the wine's aromatics and lightly spices it with pepper. Masterful blending by Andrew Rich.",20.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
66714,Sierra Moon 2005 Syrah (Fair Play),"From this very high mountain vineyard in the Sierra Foothills comes this fine, although tannic, 100% Syrah. It certainly has Northern Rhône aspirations, in the peppery, leathery complexities that accompany the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. Those aforementioned tannins are big-time, but a slice of grilled beef will tame them.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
66720,Seven Hills 2005 Pentad Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Subtle and soft, this aromatic Bordeaux blend (54% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Carmenère, 9% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot) is laced with herb and exotic and savory spices, woven through tight fruit flavors of blueberry and musky grape. This is a delicate, evocative and challenging wine that rewards your attention. Fascinating and complex, it needs time to breathe and good glassware to really open up.",50.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
66926,Clos du Bois 2005 Sonoma Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Hot in alcohol, dry and thin in fruit, this Zin shows very modest blackberry, cherry and spice flavors. Finishes with a scour of sticky tannins.",22.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
66933,Clos La Chance 2005 Black-Chinned Syrah (Central Coast),"An average, slightly raw Syrah, with edgy tannins that finish with a bit of a scowl. Packed inside are blackberry, currant, cocoa, pepper and herb flavors.",18.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
67050,Scott Harvey 2005 Mountain Selection Zinfandel (Amador County),"Here's a full-bodied, lusty Zin. With a rustically tannic structure and ripe, almost overripe flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and black pepper, it's a natural for a peppery flank steak.",20.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
67056,Fenestra 2005 Silvaspoons Vineyard Malbec (Lodi),"This is a soft, ripe wine that has a certain charm in the forwardness of the flavors of cherries, black raspberries, milk chocolate, spicy anise and smoky oak. Fully dry and modest in alcohol, it will be fine with hard cheese or a broiled steak.",20.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
67518,Simi 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County),"A solid everyday Merlot that offers plenty of ripe berry, cherry and smoky oak flavors now. Dry and tannic, it has enough stuffing and class to pair with a nice steak.",20.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
67665,Rancho Arroyo Grande 2005 Deep Sea Red (Arroyo Grande Valley),"You'll find strong flavors of grilled blackberries and black cherries, tobacco, unsweetened baker's chocolate and black pepper in this dry, tannic wine. Made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Counoise, it's rustic and high in alcohol. Makes you think of beef tacos.",24.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
67667,Toad Hollow 2005 Reserve Richard McDowell Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A bit harsh and green in tannins, with menthol-infused blackberry and cherry flavors that finish in a scour of pepper. Drink now.",18.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
67860,Alpha Omega 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Structure defines this wine. It has a great architecture of tannins, acids and oak, with a firm, dry finish. That stands it in stark relief to today's modern cult style of fruity softness, and to the wine's credit. It's Bordeaux-like, with cherry, currant, herb and cedar flavors, and should develop over the next decade. A winery to watch.",64.0,92,3,0.966990360015615

68045,Herzog 2005 Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Zinfandel-Syrah Red (California),"Showing some aggressive tannins now, this unusual blend hails from Napa, San Luis Obispo and San Joaquin counties. It's very dry, with a solid core of red and black currant, carob and bell pepper flavors. Could develop some bottle complexity in a few years.",34.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
68098,Skipstone 2005 Oliver's Blend Red (Alexander Valley),"Notable for its richness and concentration of fruit, and also for the finesse of the tannin structure. Feels softly lush and luxurious, with potent blackberry and cherry-pie filling, raspberry liqueur, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood flavors. Needs time to resolve its elements. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.",105.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
68293,South Coast 2005 Wild Horse Peak Thunderbolt Block Sangiovese (South Coast),"Distinctly sweet, like crushed blackberry and cherry fruit that's had a dose of white sugar added. Fortunately, the acids and tannins provide good structural balance.",32.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
68294,Novy 2005 Judge Family Vineyard Grenache (Bennett Valley),"Lots of juicy cherry, black raspberry, vanilla and smoky flavors in this soft wine, but it struggles to rise above simplicity. Would benefit from blending with harder, darker, more tannic varieties, like Syrah or Petite Sirah.",26.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
68306,Sylvester 2005 Le Vigne di San Domenico Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Comes down on Petite Sirah's rustic, slightly sweet side. Even though the alcohol is pretty high, there's a sugary, porty finish to the blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The wine also has the bigtime tannins you expect from this variety, and should age for several years.",29.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
68905,Clos du Bois 2005 Sonoma Reserve Tempranillo (Alexander Valley),"Clos du Bois continues their effort with this great red variety of Spain, and the '05 is their best yet. It's like a good Zinfandel, except not as full-bodied, with spicy black pepper, cherry and currant flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Could even improve with a few years in the bottle.",23.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
68997,Horan Estates 2005 CWN Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Stiffly tannic, this is straight-on boysenberry juice, firm and full-bodied. It shows a little bit of earthiness, hints of herb and a citrusy zip to the acids. The alcohol, pushing 15%, does not intrude.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
69372,Beaulieu Vineyard 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A very nice Merlot whose pure cherry, red currant and cedar flavors are supported by rich, sturdy tannins. The finish is spicy and long. Great partner with steaks and chops, and the price is right.",15.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
69474,Ojai 2005 Roll Ranch Vineyard Syrah (California),"Despite the California appellation, the grapes were grown in the Ojai region of Santa Barbara County. It's a dry, tannic wine whose ripe blackberry, mocha and oak flavors are balanced with rich earthiness. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",45.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
69475,Pininfarina 2005 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley),"Made solidly in the modern cult style of fruity ripeness, softness and rich oak shadings, this inaugural red from Gary Heck is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a splash of Sangiovese. It has complicated layers of blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate. Quite delicious in primary fruit flavors, it could well be an ager.",95.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
69549,South Coast 2005 Rolling Hills Estate Vineyard Syrah (Temecula),"Sugary and simple, with sweet cola, licorice, blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The tannins are very finely structured, but the wine is just too sweet.",24.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
69874,Karly 2005 Warrior Fires Zinfandel (Amador County),"The name suggests certain proprietarily named Ports, and it's an apt descriptor for this muscular wine, which has superripe flavors of currants and raisins that veer into an overripe tartness. It's dry, but with very high alcohol.",26.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
69889,Millésimé 2005 Lumiere du Fleur Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Bordeaux blend is soft, fruity and a little sweet, with the flavor of a cherry and blackberry confection in a cinnamon and anise pastry crust. Drink soon.",56.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

70199,Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Dauphiné Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 100% estate-grown Syrah remains obstinately hard and tight, with a strongly tannic streak. Tangy and concentrated fruit flavors include boysenberry and loganberry jam, with a streak of graphite and stone. Give it a lot of breathing time—decanting would be best.",70.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
70211,Robert Karl 2005 Claret Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The term Claret is used properly here, to represent a classic Bordeaux blend, in this instance including all five grapes in generous proportions. It's a sensational value, with the depth, detail and precision of a much more expensive wine. Spicy red fruits, wisps of herb and black olive, a hint of earth and tar, all tease and tantalize, without overpowering the wine's innate finesse.",20.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
70552,Quilceda Creek 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rich and chocolaty, this dense and detailed wine is loaded with brambly fruit, ripe cherry and baking chocolate. It's dotted with fine-grained, coffee-streaked tannins, and finishes with highlights of butterscotch and malted milk candies. As with all the 2005 Quilceda's, this is still young and tight. It is dominated by the barrel flavors that only slowly meld into the massive fruit with extensive breathing time (36 hours after being opened the wine was still improving).",75.0,93,3,0.966990360015615

70843,Snoqualmie 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has light, pretty cherry and raspberry fruit flavors, forward and slightly sweet. The acids are chewy and puckery—acidification?—and therefore the finish is rather citric and sharp. The addition of 25% Cabernet Sauvignon may have also contributed.",10.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
70844,Stephen Vincent 2005 Crimson Red (California),"Rich in cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors, this Rhône blend has sweet-and-sour berry-cherry flavors. It's rich in dry, furry tannins. Needs something big and meaty to soften it, like beef stew.",11.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
70852,Arrowood 2005 Côte de Lune Rouge Red (Sonoma Valley),"Made from Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache, this is a fairly ordinary red wine, with cherry, currant, smoke, spice and herb flavors. Drink now.",28.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
71304,Thomas Fogarty 2005 Gist Ranch Estate Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Bring this down to the cellar and let it sleep for at least 5–6 years. It's super-tannic, giving a hard, angular mouthfeel, even though the blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are powerful. It just wants to throw some sediment and let that mountain fruit shine.",48.0,90,3,0.966990360015615

71351,Rocca 2005 Bad Boy Red (Yountville),"A Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this wine tastes surprisingly cooked for such a cool vintage. There's a raisiny, smoky, baked blackberry and cherry flavor that makes for an imbalance that won't age away.",29.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
71358,Addamo 2005 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),"Smells overripe, with a sharp, raisiny smell, and tastes hot, harsh and medicinal. It has cough drop cherry flavors that are sugary-sweet and acidic.",26.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
71375,Ten Mile 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (California),"Starts out sulfury, a smell that's very slow to blow off. Beneath that eggy scent, this Petite Sirah, Barbera, Zin and Carignane blend isn't bad. Dry and tannic, it shows a robust earthiness reminiscent of certain Spanish reds. But the sulfur kills it.",11.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
71752,Columbia Winery 2005 Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills),"This hits 15.5% alcohol—amazingly high for a Columbia wine. The tart red fruit is offset with sweet grain and dried herbs, almost like an old vine Zin from northern California. Somehow the herbs overmatch the berry flavors, which seem a bit on the light side, despite the high alcohol. Young vines?",28.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

71761,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"As is most often the case with Sangiovese, this comes across as a pleasant, rather generic red wine that could be almost anything. The fruit tastes of light cherry and plum, with a rather sour finish. Tannins are earthy and there is a hint of sweaty saddle as well.",32.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
71762,Clayhouse 2005 Hillside Cuvée Red (Paso Robles),"This Bordeaux blend is very dry and very tannic. There's something old-fashionedly rustic about it. With deep blackberry flavors, it may age, but it's not very hedonistic right now.",28.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
71763,Core Winery 2005 Alta Mesa Vineyard Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Hot, raspingly dry and pretty tannic to boot, this Grenache, from a high mountain vineyard, also is a little funky and barnyardy.

71765,Whitestone 2005 Lake Roosevelt Shores Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and supple, this quite approachable wine has simple, lightly fruity flavors. It's generic, pleasant and ready to drink, with some milk chocolaty oak in the finish. Though it lists at 14.6% alcohol, it does not have commensurate weight or density of flavor.",28.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
71766,Hawkstone 2005 Barney's Heritage Cuvée Merlot (Napa Valley),"A little too dry and bitter for enjoyment, with dried blackberry, leather and orange zest flavors. The tannins leave the palate slightly numb on the finish.",20.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
72231,Bergevin Lane 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bergevin Lane's wines show a rich mix of herbal and earth flavors, with ripe but not overly sweet fruit. This 100% varietal Syrah is herbaceous and aromatic, with rich scents that mix the purple fruits with intimations of herb, chocolate and cracker. It's elegant and tight, and should be decanted for several hours. Once it breathes open, it's perfectly balanced and drinkable right now.",26.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
72592,Gainey 2005 Limited Selection Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"A very nice, polished Syrah that shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity and black pepper spiciness that make the tastebuds whistle. There's a good core of blackberry, coffee and baker's chocolate fruit, although it could be a little more concentrated for the price. Drink now through 2009.",42.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
72813,Paul Dolan 2005 Zinfandel (Mendocino-Amador),"This is really a lovely Zin. It has the weight, tannic structure and complexity of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the flavors are all Zinfandel.

72950,Three Rivers 2005 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A dark, firm, muscular wine, blended with 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The grapes show flavors of the region – dark, spicy boysenberry fruit, wrapped in smoky tannins. Its excellent varietal character and concentration suggest that this wine has a potential cellar life of a decade or more.",25.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
73985,VJB 2005 Syrah (El Dorado County),"Too sweet and Porty. This mountain-grown Syrah has rich cherry-berry flavors and smooth tannins, but seems to have some residual sugar that makes it taste more like a dessert wine than a table wine.",28.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
73994,Hahn 2005 Meritage (Central Coast),"In its youth, this Bordeaux blend is dry and a little harsh, with a green, minty edge to the cherry fruit and oak. The acidity accentuates the tannins, which give the wine a hard finish. Not going anywhere, so drink now.",20.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
73997,Barreto 2005 Verdelho (Lodi),"The major defect of this wine is excessive sweetness. Without the sugary flavor, it would be great, for it has wonderfully crisp acidity and flavors of citrus fruits, peaches and minerals.",16.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
74067,Cliff Creek 2005 Syrah (Southern Oregon),"Helped by extra bottle age, this Syrah is the best of the latest releases from Cliff Creek.

74740,Dolce 2005 Late Harvest Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Year in and year out, Dolce is one of California's greatest sweet dessert wines, and in 2005, it may stand supreme. It's an impossibly rich wine, mainly because the botrytis mold developed perfectly in this fine vintage. Shows fabulous flavors of apricot purée, vanilla-infused crême brulée, pineapple sorbet and candied ginger, balanced with brilliant acidity. The residual sugar is 12 percent.",85.0,95,3,0.966990360015615

74962,Conn Creek 2005 Anthology Red (Napa Valley),"A sad approximation of the old Anthology, whose quality has been sinking in recent years. The ‘05 is not quite ripe, with vegetal notes to the blackberries and sweet oak. It's an okay wine, but this once-fine wine's best days are gone.",50.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
75297,Four Vines 2005 Bailey Vineyard Syrah (Amador County),"There's plenty of ripe pie-filling fruit flavor in this dry wine.

Turns a bit hot on the finish.",38.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
75392,Renwood 2005 Barbera (Amador County),"Rich, ripe and flavorful, this mountain Barbera will age for a long time. That's a simple function of its balance. It's very tannic, high in acidity, and those blackberry and cherry flavors are just waiting to star. Nice now if you need a big, tight young red wine, but should hold for a decade.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
75832,Clos du Val 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a dry, tannic and somewhat earthy Merlot. The structure is impeccably elegant, and there's a wealth of herb-infused blackberry and currant fruit flavor that makes it rewarding.",26.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
75838,Mazzocco 2005 Reserve Pony Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"With over 16% alcohol and a splash of Petite Sirah, this Zin can be called generous. It has a rich, creamy texture, and the black currant, cherry jam, mocha and anise flavors are fully dry.",40.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
75845,Wild Oak by St. Francis 2005 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Soft in texture, this Zin has flavors of freshly crushed, ripe blackberries, cherries and raspberries, cocoa and black pepper, with a burnt brown-butter, baked pastry crust edge. It's pretty tannic, which makes it a good foil for rich meats and cheeses. Decant for an hour or two.",32.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
76047,Turnbull 2005 Black Label Estate Grown Red (Oakville),"Not drinkable now or anytime soon, due to the tannins. Scours the mouth with a hard astringency, like the Cabernets of a generation or two ago. There are rich, ripe flavors of blackberries and currants swimming below those depths, as well as lots of sweet, smoky oak.

76468,Newsome-Harlow 2005 Meritage (Calaveras County),"This is almost the anti-Napa Bordeaux blend. It's drier and edgier than your typical North Coast Cab, and much less tannic, with a sweet herb edge to the flavors of cherries, red and black currant, plums, tangerine zest, licorice and cloves.

76479,Waters 2005 Forgotten Hills Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 100% Syrah is tight, young and sappy, and the tart fruit tastes of salmonberries and blueberries, with hints of mineral and flint. Call it a Euro style, with that sort of grip and detail. It rewards airtime and attention, yet still hints at a slightly green edge.",40.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
76484,Chatter Creek 2005 'Blend 105' Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a Bordeaux blend, using all five grapes, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Forward, fruity, round and immediately appealing, this tasty effort shows good balance and supporting structure, but the real story is the bright, vibrant Washington fruit, packed in tightly and substantial enough for aging.",22.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
76488,Rancho Zabaco 2005 Sonoma Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Gallo did a great job with this wine, producing 31,000 cases and yet making the wine smooth, balanced and delicious. It's quintessential Sonoma Zin, with briary flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, and coatings of chocolate, anisette, bacon and spices.",18.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
76491,Peachy Canyon 2005 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"An interesting Zin that attracts for its range of sweet fruit and dried herb flavors. The cherries, blackberries and raspberries have complex interweavings of thyme and lavender, leaving the palate to discover new sensations with every sip. Finishes dry and smoothly tannic.",36.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
76495,Trust 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though quite dark, spicy, smoky, fragrant and seductive, this is a very flavorful wine. Citrusy acids underscore flavors of grapefruit and orange, but the core of the wine is straightforward, pure and ripe berry. It's nice not to fight the fruit with oak; the aromatics are beautiful.",28.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
76501,Daniel Gehrs 2005 Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"This dessert wine is sweetly complex, with apricot jam, peach pie, honeysuckle, vanilla fudge and smoky butterscotch flavors. Fortunately, the acidity is fine and crisp, providing a clean balance to the sweetness.",18.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
77222,Forlorn Hope 2005 Les Deux Matieux Petite Sirah (Suisun Valley),"This is an inky dark, broodingly tannic, bone-dry wine. Also an expensive one. Is it worth it? If you're a Petite Sirah fan, it's one of the most exciting of the genre you can buy. The flavors are a complex melange of blackberries, cherries, plums, mocha and dusty spices. This is in serious need of cellaring. Best after 2008, and for a decade afterward.",47.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
77227,Greenwood Ridge 2005 Merlot (Mendocino Ridge),". The winery's above-the-fog vineyard has been kind to Merlot, nearly always producing an interesting wine. The '05, from such a cool vintage, has given crisp, firm tannins, but long hangtime allowed the grapes to develop luscious blackberry flavors, which smoky oak perfectly accents. A wine of charm and depth; should develop bottle complexity over the next 6 years.",25.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
77247,Sausal 2005 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Here's a reserve that really does merit its special designation. Made from 90-year-old vines that likely contain varieties other than Zinfandel, the wine is rich and complex. Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. This is an exceptionally well-balanced Zin that's best in its flashy youth.",23.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
77280,Provenance Vineyards 2005 Beckstoffer Las Amigas Vineyard Merlot (Carneros),"A little unbalanced, with some overripe, pruny flavors and heat from high alcohol. The lack of fruity richness accentuates the tannins. Drink up.",60.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
77288,Bota Box 2005 Shiraz (California),"Art gallery openings, backyard barbecues and other occasions when you want a nice, dry, affordable red are suited to this boxed wine, the equivalent of four regular bottles. It has pleasant blackberry, currant and cherry jam flavors.",18.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

77875,Silver Stone Winery 2005 Primal Red (Central Coast),"A very nice wine that's dry and smooth and satisfying, yet shows real layers of complexity.

78351,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Orphelin Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Orphelin is a real head-scratcher. A mutt wine blend of nine grapes, it might be trying to be Châteauneuf-du-WA except for the Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir and Touriga. Whatever, it comes together in a raisiny, broadly-built, unfocused red wine that could be fine on a picnic.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
79157,Russian Hill 2005 Top Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"A lovely wine that, despite its youthful impertinence, shows dramatic flair now and should develop in the short term. It has the weight and structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with flavors that veer toward red cherries, sweet leather and pomegranates. All this is kept in tight rein by acidity. This is a balanced wine that wants to assist food.",32.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
79162,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Canoe Ridge Estate Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"A strong contender for the best $22 Merlot in the country. Sculpted, dense and deeply layered, it's loaded with mixed blue and black fruits, fresh herb and sweet toast. The use of new oak is restrained and appropriate, extending the finish with nicely applied streaks of coffee around ripe, tight, dry tannins.",22.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
79541,Millésimé 2005 Le Reflexion Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very soft and light-bodied, almost without tannins, this gentle wine has flavors of cherries, chocolate, orange zest, anise and vanilla. Could use greater structural volume, especially at this price.",65.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
79585,Opolo 2005 Maestro Red (Paso Robles),"A Southern Rhône blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, this red wine is soft, light-bodied and frankly sweet. It has Porty flavors of raisins, currants, chocolate and anise.",30.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
79864,Shafer 2005 Relentless Red (Napa Valley),"This blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is made in a drink-me-now style that emphasizes sheer deliciousness. Soft and almost sweet, it dazzles with pastry-filling cherries and raspberries, with exotic touches of cocoa, anise and cinnamon. Tannins provide a sturdy architecture, but they're ripe and accessible.",70.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
80671,Argyle 2005 Extended Tirage Brut Sparkling (Willamette Valley),"Two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay, this aged a decade in bottle on the yeast, before being disgorged in August 2015. Amazingly fresh, it bursts with subtle, well-integrated flavors of citrus rind, peach, almond and pastry. The length and imposing structure suggest it can age for another decade. Drink now through 2025.",75.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
80954,Roshambo 2005 The Reverend Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Picture-perfect Dry Creek Valley Zin. So lush, so delicious, you just can't get enough.

81398,Mark Ryan 2005 Water Witch Klipsun Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This is classic Washingon Merlot; plush with dark and smoky fruit, a supple and muscular mouthfeel, and broad flavors of plum and cherry. The generous (80%) use of new French oak adds plenty of chocolate and spice. Klipsun fruit can sometimes be rough and tannic, but here it is supple and almost soft, like real Corinthian leather.",45.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
81403,Beresan 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish.",29.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
81410,Quivira 2005 Wine Creek Ranch Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"No matter how hard you try to tame Petite Sirah and make it civilized, it retains its feral, rustic nature, which is what makes it such an interesting wine in the right hands. Quivira has “claretized” this wine, yoking the intense cassis, currant, cocoa, gamy leather and pepper flavors to finely ground tannins and a modest alcohol level. But it's still a quintessentially wild Petite Sirah. Drink now through 2017.",26.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
81415,Bella 2005 Belle Canyon Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Once again, this bottling delivers a big, lush, complex and succulent young wine for Zin specialist Bella. Marked by extraordinary spices, the wine, with a little Petite Sirah, has powerful wild blackberry and raspberry, olive tapenade, cola and carob flavors that finish with a classic Zin briary, brambly character.",35.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
81416,Beresan 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% varietal, a 50-50 blend from Waliser and Candy Mountain vineyards. A beautiful color, deep purple, leads into a substantial Merlot with smooth berry flavors. Highlight hints of soy and balsamic are streaked into the midpalate, and the wine sails into a dark, smoky finish, which lasts a minute or longer, sending out a rainbow of flavors suggesting stone fruits and even a bit of papaya.",29.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
81514,Arger-Martucci 2005 Odyssey Red (Atlas Peak),"This is a big, powerful and still young Cabernet blend that's not ready to drink yet. The massive blackberry, black currant, violet and dark chocolate flavors haven't meshed with the smoky oak, while a cut of fruity acidity makes for a tart mouthfeel. But it should easily negotiate the years. Better after 2011, and should blossom afterwards.",50.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
81528,Venteux 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soft and tannic, this polished Syrah has easy, delicious flavors of chocolate, red currants, grilled meat, teriyaki and pepper. It's pure Paso Robles Syrah. Drink now.",36.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
81585,Falcor 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Rustic and somewhat sharp, this Zin has a green, spearmint streak, with some harsh tannins, which suggests unevenly ripened berries, despite very high alcohol. It's like a combination of cherry Lifesavers, blackberries and Altoids breath mints. Drink now.",36.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
81590,Midnight 2005 Gemini Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"With high alcohol, this blend of Zinfandel and Syrah has a hot, peppery mouthfeel. The flavors are of slightly burnt, pie-filling blackberries and cherries.",39.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
81693,Jeff Gordon 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Even nearing six years of age, this Merlot remains tannic, although the cherry and blackberry fruit is starting to dry out. There's a curious sweetness at its core. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",49.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
81764,Bradford Mountain 2005 Grist Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a big, tough, gritty Zinfandel that will please fans of the style. It's extremely ripe in jammy blackberries, currants, cherry pie filling, anise and pepper, and finishes sweet in fruity richness.",34.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
81977,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Morrison Lane Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The Morrison Lane Vineyard Syrah is one of the highlights of the lineup from K Vintners, but has not previously been made by Walla Walla Vintners. Here it is shown unblended and wrapped in a generous amount of cinnamon, baking spice, milk chocolate and hazelnut flavors from barrel aging. The juice is a little overpowered, though the acids punch through with some tart raspberry fruit.",32.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
81981,Easton 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Fiddletown),"Dark, lusty, powerful, stuffed with jammy dark berry and stone fruits, this Zin is a natural for rich beef dishes, and should reward aging. The blackberry and mulberry flavors are incredibly spicy, while the tannins are a bit astringent now, suggesting a few years in the cellar.",28.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
81993,Columbia Crest 2005 Stone Tree Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Wahluke Slope),"This limited release (300 cases), first-ever Zin from Columbia Crest points to the rising prominence of this quintessentially Californian grape. In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance. Tightly-defined raspberry, blackberry and plum fruits, scented with violets and juicy with fresh acid, take to the new oak aging well. It's a balanced mix of berry, barrel and crisp, palate-cleansing acid.",30.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
82237,Andretti 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Thin and weedy, with dill and oregano flavors and just a drop of cherry or blackberry fruit. Finishes dry and tannic.",33.0,83,3,0.966990360015615

82249,Chaddsford 2005 Miller Estate Vineyard Chambourcin (Pennsylvania),"Tobacco and spice aromas lead into flavors of jammy fruit and vanilla. A touch smoky on the finish, with pretty aromatics typical of the grape. Pair with lamb or grilled meats.",25.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
82253,Rosenblum 2005 Richard Sauret Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Hot, soft and uninteresting. It's not a bad wine, being clean and somewhat dry, but that softness results in a serious absence of structure, and there's not enough fruity essence to compensate.",25.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
82254,Scott Harvey 2005 J&S; Reserve Barbera (Amador County),"This winery has been working for years with Barbera, but it's a tough grape to perfect in California. This shows the variety's rustic side, with briary flavors of wild berries and thick tannins. It's also sweet on the finish, like a simple Port.",28.0,83,3,0.966990360015615

82270,Matchbook 2005 Syrah (Dunnigan Hills),"This Syrah isn't the richest red wine, but it is very dry and balanced and, in its own way, quite elegant. With some scoury tannins, good acidity and pepper-infused cherry and tobacco flavors, it has enough complexity to accompany fine foods.",16.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
82433,D'Argenzio 2005 D'Alfonso Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley),"Dry and bitter, this Sangiovese is better than most California bottlings, but has its work cut out for it. It shows a good range of tart cherryskin flavors, with additional flavors of acidic things like espresso and tobacco.",28.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
82435,Murrieta's Well 2005 White Meritage Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley),"A blend of 60% Sémillon and 40% Sauvignon Blanc, this is barrel-fermented, with the Sémillon component being put through malolactic fermentation. The result is a medium-bodied white with a smoky, buttery bouquet and flavors of peach, passion fruit and grapefruit. Drink now.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
82436,Page Cellars 2005 Libra De Carta Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fruit is light and almost delicate, suggesting mountain strawberries and sour plums. The one-year-old French oak still imparts a significant burst of bourbon barrel flavor, especially in the finish, which resonates like a bourbon and chocolate bon-bon.",30.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
82442,La Fenêtre 2005 South Mesa Barnwood Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A bit on the dry, tannic side, this Syrah's astringency hides a rich core of blackberry and black cherry fruit. It's really too hard to enjoy now. Decant for hours, or try the cellar, although that's a gamble.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
82789,Crush 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This blend of Cabernet and Merlot tastes more like a Shiraz than a Bordeaux blend. It's jammy and peppery and also Porty, with an overripe, brandied taste.",12.0,81,3,0.966990360015615

82808,Leonetti Cellar 2005 Reserve Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish.",125.0,97,3,0.966990360015615
82878,Feliz Noche 2005 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Very full-bodied, heavy and dense, with significant tannins, although they're ripe and soft, which makes this Syrah drinkable now. It's enormously rich in blackberries, currants, chocolate, licorice and sweet oak. Probably at its best now and for a year or two.",45.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
82889,Osprey's Dominion 2005 Flight Meritage (North Fork of Long Island),"An enticing Meritage, with aromas of violet, anise, crushed herbs and red berry fruit followed by deep, savory spice flavors of cinnamon, pepper and cedar. Balanced but full of character, this wine will pair well with meats and poultry dishes.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
83136,Steppe Cellars 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This is a light, well-balanced Yakima Valley take on Merlot, with fresh strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors lightly dusted with chocolate. A pleasant quaffing wine for sure, but nothing substantial about it.",23.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
83152,Cass 2005 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this has a chocolate mint edge to the sugary sweet LifeSaver candy blackberries and cherries. The tannins and acids are good, though, and the wine would score higher if it were drier.",42.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
83153,Waterstone 2005 Syrah (Napa Valley),"This Syrah was grown in Carneros in the cool, long '05 vintage, which may explain its minty sharpness, despite the low case production level. You'll find enough cherry fruit and new French oak to make it fairly rich, but that sharp green tang remains.",22.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
83154,Writer's Block 2005 Petite Sirah (Lake County),"Rustic and sweet on the finish, with jellied blackberry, cherry, licorice, cola and Asian spice flavors. Gains a point or two for its smooth, rich tannins. Drink now.",16.0,84,3,0.966990360015615

83945,Chatter Creek 2005 Clifton Hill Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"In the Chatter Creek style, this is solid, well-made and varietal. Tart fruit flavors of boysenberry and pomegranate are set against firm tannins. Green tea, herb and peppery bark flavors take over the finish. The wine persists nicely in the finish.",38.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
84000,Saxum 2005 James Berry Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"Solidly in the Saxum style, which is to say a high alcohol (15.5%), massively flavored wine of enormous concentration and power. The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache.",55.0,95,3,0.966990360015615
84006,Andrew Will 2005 Sorella Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The Sorella is deep and dense with thick textures and tannins. The typical black currant and black cherry fruit character is here in spades, and yet at 14.4% alcohol the wine avoids any fatiguing jamminess or heat in the finish. It leaves a slightly chalky, chocolatey impression as it exits the throat, and promises a long life ahead.",65.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
84011,Jaffe 2005 Transformation Proprietary Blend Red (St. Helena),"Outstanding. Almost equal parts Cab and Merlot, this wine is immature now, all primary cherry and currant fruit, unintegrated oak and chunky tannins. But it's a stunning wine, brilliant and pure, with a rich earthiness. You can drink it now, with a few hours of decanting, but it will be best after 2010 and beyond.",58.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
84014,Saxum 2005 James Berry Vineyard Bone Rock Red (Paso Robles),"The wine comes from a particular portion of the estate vineyard, and is almost entirely Syrah, with a splash of Grenache. It is a brilliant wine, entirely New World, and impressive even by California and Australia standards. Massively rich in cherry, chocolate, cassis, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, the '05 Bone Rock is softly tannic and compulsively drinkable, although the alcohol, 16.1%, is considerable. Best now and for a year or two.",55.0,94,3,0.966990360015615

It's pretty tannic, which makes it a good foil for rich meats and cheeses. Decant for an hour or two.",32.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
84943,Cambria 2005 Tepusquet Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"You get a lot of bang for your buck with this dry, complex young Syrah.

Tasted twice over a six month period, the wine remains stubbornly tough and chewy, despite appealing chocolaty spice and penetrating raspberry and currant fruit.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
85597,Dry Creek Vineyard 2005 The Mariner Meritage (Dry Creek Valley),"There may be a good wine here, but this Bordeaux blend is still very hard in tannins and acids, giving it a tough, unyielding mouthfeel. Yet there are deep flavors of currants, cassis and mocha. Could develop over the long haul. Try after 2011.",40.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
85767,Silver Stone Winery 2005 Keeper Red (San Luis Obispo County),"A blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is a lovely, polished and serious red wine.

85860,Maryhill 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This herbal, tannic Syrah is a serviceable bottle that would be especially good with a simple flank steak. Scents are a mix of grape blossom, cherry and coffee. The wine is solid and one dimensional and finishes with a strong herbal streak.",20.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
85872,Waltzing Bear 2005 Bud Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A little jagged around the edges, with some harsh tannins surrounding riper notes of blackberries and tobacco. Could develop bottle nuances in a few years.",32.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
85904,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2005 Trenton Estate Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"A bit over the top in fruity extraction, a bomb blast of sweet raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. It's almost like a dessert wine. Yet there's a lot of tannins and acidity, and who knows? It could do interesting things. At this price, buy a bottle and stick it in the cellar for six years.",22.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
86195,D'Argenzio 2005 D'Loiodice Zinfandel Rosá Rosé (Russian River Valley),"There's nothing subtle about this blush wine made from Zinfandel. It was barrel fermented and barrel aged for 15 months, giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel and even some dusty tannins, and it has robust flavors of cherries, cola, beef jerky and licorice. But it's dry and crisp and is something different.",22.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86197,Greg Norman California Estates 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This wine may age to interesting things, but currently it's hard in tannins and acidity, and so dry it makes you long for some sugar. But you'll find a deep core of black currant, licorice and spicy plum flavors. Should pair well with rustic grilled meats.",15.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86198,Jekel 2005 Merlot (Monterey County),"Here's a nice everyday Merlot. It's not only flavorful in cherry, black currant, raspberry, and mocha flavors, it has a velvety texture, and leaves behind a pleasantly dry, spicy finish.",15.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86204,Stacked Stone 2005 The Quarry Red (Paso Robles),"Made from the two Cabernets, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this is a gentle wine with some true complexity. It has interesting cherry flavor with a deeper stream of cassis liqueur.",27.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86207,Château Julien 2005 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Monterey County),"Pretty good, but a little on the rustic side, with baked blackberry, cherry and currant flavors wrapped into some rugged, edgy tannins. Could just be going through an awkward phase, but its future is hard to predict.",40.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86400,Jax 2005 Y3 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Marked by jammy fruit and high acidity, this Syrah is strong in cherries, raspberries and oak. It's not especially subtle, but it is pretty and polished, and could even acquire bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",29.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
86603,Velocity Wine Cellars 2005 Velocity Red Red (Rogue Valley),"Half Malbec, this medium-bodied red lacks the definition of its cheaper companion, the Velo. Maybe a vintage difference, but this just falls into the generic red blend category, without any defining features.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
86898,Calix 2005 Masked Man Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Shows fine pedigree in the ripeness and finesse of the tannins, which are as pure as velvet. Flavorwise, this Syrah is very ripe, bursting in blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and mocha flavors that are almost sweet on the finish. It's made in the modern Napa style, and not an ager.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
86900,Dogwood 2005 Meritage (Mendocino),"Exceedingly ripe, this Bordeaux blend shows blackberry, cherry, currant, plum, raspberry and chocolate fruit flavors, heightened with sweet, smoky oak. It's direct in its appeal. Drink now.",38.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
87145,Gordon Brothers 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy, woody and sharp, with good red fruits. However, there is a strong streak of bitter green vegetal flavors running through the tannins. The bitterness may subside with more cellar time, but at the moment it does kill a lot of the fruit sweetness.",20.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
87150,Mandolin 2005 Merlot (Central Coast),"Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy.",10.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
87205,Four Vines 2005 Heretic Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Here's a lusty, lip-smackingly ripe Petite Sirah that's perfect for grilled meats and hard cheeses. Full-throttle flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate finish with Asian spices in this dry, softly tannic wine.",38.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
87211,Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"This is the driest, most concentrated and sophisticated of Kenwood's current trio of Merlots, and also the only one that will benefit from cellaring. It's compact in blackberry, currant, tea, leather and spice flavors that finish with a scour of tannins. Best 2008–2011.",25.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
87717,Renwood 2005 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Here's a solid everyday Zin, lusty and rustic, offering up a big gulp of fruity flavor. Blackberries, cherries, mulberries, root beer, licorice, and just about every spice you can name shows up. It's a dry, tannic wine that will love rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",10.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
87718,Reverie 2005 Merlot (Diamond Mountain District),"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager.",50.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
87719,Standing Stone 2005 Pinnacle Red (Finger Lakes),"Blueberry, black cherry and red berries on the nose are followed by structured but slightly tart red fruit flavors on the palate.  Diverse spices and some oak add weight and balance the edge. The wine is generally food friendly and flavorful.",23.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
87727,American Roots 2005 Blue Red (Napa Valley),"This is Syrah. It has a classic Napa structure, with finely meshed tannins and soft acids, and has been treated with sweet, smoky oak. Needs to be drier, for the blackberry, currant, cherry and chocolate flavors finish with a sugary sweetness.",25.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
87728,American Roots 2005 Red Merlot (Napa Valley),"A rustic Merlot. The cherry, cassis and chocolate fruit flavors are so powerful, they swamp the wine, leaving elegance behind and making it indelicate.",18.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
87735,Little Black Dress 2005 Merlot (California),"Ripe and rustic, this is a good everyday Merlot made for simple fare. It's rich and direct in blackberry pie, cherry jam, cola, cocoa and smoky vanilla flavors.",10.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
88172,Iron Horse 2005 Chinese Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"This vintage was a good one for Iron Horse, resulting in this wine of finesse and clarity. It's fruit-forward, with excellent acidity and a sour, yeasty bite help to balance its rich quality. The mousse is exceptionally refined. This has the potential to age quite well over the next decade.",98.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
88316,Schramsberg 2005 J. Schram Rosé Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin),"An enormously  complex wine, but one that's not quite ready for prime time. Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed. With brisk acidity and slight scouriness, it wants a good eight years in the cellar, and should age well beyond that.",140.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
88487,Twisted Oak 2005 Tanner Vineyard Syrah (Calaveras County),"If you like those funky, barnyardy, leathery notes in your Syrahs, this one's for you. It's bone dry and rich in tannins, with blackberry and black currant flavors, in addition to that bacon. Drink now.",32.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
89165,Chatter Creek 2005 Clifton Vineyard Nebbiolo (Wahluke Slope),"This is a respectable effort; seems to be oxidizing quickly, but it is elegant and clear, with a tartness that is reminiscent of Counoise. Nicely aromatic, with the rose petal and light tobacco leaf scents of the Italian grape.",38.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89171,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 Byzance Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Young and tight, this wine is scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89172,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 L'Etalon Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red. Tasted twice over a six month period, the wine remains stubbornly tough and chewy, despite appealing chocolaty spice and penetrating raspberry/currant fruit.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89255,St. Francis 2005 Red (Sonoma County),"Bring on the pizza, pasta and barbecue. Here's a good everyday red at a fair price. It's dry and sturdy in tannins, with berry, cherry, tobacco and spice flavors.",12.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
89303,Domaine Alfred 2005 Chamisal Vineyards Syrah (Edna Valley),"This Syrah shows the bright fruit and crisp, organizing acidity of Domaine Alfred's Chamisal botting, which is their reserve, without quite the lushness and power. Nonetheless, it's a fine Syrah, firm and dry in tannins, with fat, sappy texture framing jammy cherry, blackberry and peppery fruit.",28.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89307,Longboard 2005 DaKine Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",45.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89446,Peachy Canyon 2005 Westside Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is the winery's standard-bearer, produced in hefty quantities. In this vintage, it's a very nice wine, showcasing Zin's briary, brambly character, with wild cherry, thyme and pepper flavors. The wine is dry, with a smooth, creamy texture, and, in its own way, classic Paso Robles Zinfandel.",19.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
89533,Bernardus 2005 Marinus Red (Carmel Valley),"Well-structured and dry, but lacking in fruity richness, with a note of asparagus. That disrupts the cherries and oak of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties.",36.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
90000,Vina Robles 2005 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.",26.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
90008,Q 2005 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Full-bodied and robust, this has the tannicly rustic nature of an old-fashioned red. It is completely dry, with earthy flavors of dark stone fruits, currants, coffee, licorice, herbs and pepper.",16.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
90013,Arrow Creek 2005 Vintner's Selection Merlot (California),"Pretty generic-tasting but basically good, a dry red wine with considerable tannins and acids that frame herbal cherry flavors.",10.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
90015,Cape May 2005 Merlot (New Jersey),"A nose of enticing blackberry jam is followed by a slightly smoky, spicy blend of savory, earthy flavors. The nose and palate are a touch discordant, but overall the wine is unique and approachable.",18.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
90024,Midlife Crisis 2005 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Too sugary sweet, with jellied flavors of cherries and spices. More like a dessert wine than a dry table one.",19.0,81,3,0.966990360015615
90301,Retzlaff 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Livermore Valley),"A nicely made Cab-Merlot blend with earthy, dark plum, spicy cinnamon and clove and a touch of menthol herby-ness, especially on the finish. The mellow texture on this wine will see that it pairs nicely with a range of fall and wintertime foods.",39.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
90669,Bluenose 2005 Syrah (Sonoma County),"This is a heavy, rich, dry Syrah. It shows forward flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, mocha and spices, with a touch of raisins. Not likely to age, so drink up.",25.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
90821,Smith & Hook 2005 Grand Reserve Red (Central Coast),"Smith & Hook has tried hard to perfect their Cab, transferring fruit sourcing from Monterey to Paso Robles. As a result, the wines are riper, as evidenced by this fruity young Cab. The cherry and blackberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and crisp acids, making it a versatile wine at the table.",25.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
91889,Canoe Ridge 2005 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"A little floral/grapey scent comes up from the glass, then the wine descends into darker, grippier, more tannic levels with boysenberries and smoke. There's lots of acid—maybe too much—and it gives a sense of something missing as the wine heads into the finish. Green, earthy, chewy tannins leave a slightly harsh impression.",25.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
92036,Zefina 2005 Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills),"Lightly spicy and displaying a brambly character, with fruit flavors of strawberry jelly, this high alcohol (over 15%) Zin includes some high-toned, volatile notes. It is trending toward an Amador County Zinfandel style, though it is not quite that hot or volatile. All in all, it's a good effort.",20.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
92038,Morrison Lane 2005 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Morrison Lane's Sangiovese includes a little Syrah and Carmenère in the blend, giving it a light sprinkling of peppery spice. Tart red fruits fill in the rest.",26.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
92043,Calafia 2005 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Ripe fruit and new oak combine to produce a wine of power, if not of subtlety. A Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend of Bordeaux varieties, it blasts the palate with blackberry jam, cassis, chocolate and caramelized new oak flavors, and the acidity is soft and mild.",48.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
92652,Barlow 2005 Barrouge Red (Napa Valley),"This is Barlow's Bordeaux blend. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's a beautiful wine, dry and balanced and fully ready to drink now, although it will take some years of cellaring. With fine acidity and tannins, it displays elegant flavors of currants and cassis, with rich edges of mocha and cedar.",40.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
92888,Mumm Napa 2005 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's top brut, and what a gorgeous wine it is. Blended equally with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it shows lime, tangerine and strawberry flavors that are subtle and rich. The mousse is very fine, giving it a silky texture. Beautiful to drink now.",65.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
93201,Brutocao 2005 Feliz Vineyard Barbera (Mendocino),"Has a sweaty aroma that's that's hard to get past. In the mouth, the wine is simple, sweet and sharp, with raspberry-mint jelly flavors.",18.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
93204,Michael David 2005 Petite Petit Red (Lodi),"A blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this is a clumsy wine. It's soft and overripe, and the oaky overlay doesn't do anything to improve the situation.",22.0,80,3,0.966990360015615
93207,Sineann 2005 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Lovers of Cab Franc should track this wine down; it's a perfect evocation of the grape. Ripe purple plum flavors are annotated with spice and dust; the tannins are ripe and muscular; the wine sits very comfortably in the mouth. Hints of coffee grounds and tobacco liven up the finish, and the core of sweet fruit just keeps on coming.",48.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
93212,Sineann 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (OR)),"An outstanding wine. Beautifully integrated fruit flavors suggest cherry pie and ripe strawberry, with dusty herbs scattered throughout. The herbal notes are not at all bitter or tannic, so the wine has an elegance to it, and shows nicely developed and integrated flavors.",36.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
93555,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The estate Syrah immediately shows a toastier nose and richer fruit than the excellent Columbia Valley bottling. Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee. At the moment the wine seems still to be holding something back; decanting and substantial breathing time are highly recommended.",28.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
93558,Buoncristiani 2005 Artistico Syrah (Napa Valley),"Tannins weigh this Syrah down, making it toughly astringent, a wine that makes your mouth pucker. Through all that, you can taste the massive flavors of black currants, red licorice, violets, cloves and peppery grilled veal that are pure, dry and profound. Is it an ager? The pedigree suggests yes. The wine is a blend of the Caldwell, Stagecoach and Hyde-Oak Knoll vineyards. Stash it through mid-2009, if not longer.",60.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
93948,Keenan 2005 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011.",60.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
94313,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is just about perfect Sémillon— the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus. The use of oak is judicious and thoughtful; it adds grace notes without dominating. You can't help but wonder why this grape remains such a novelty (except, ironically, at Novelty Hill!). It's seductive, delicious and unique.",16.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
94415,Fernwood 2005 Small Vineyard Selection Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors. But even if it's not particularly varietal, it's a pretty good wine, with a long, rich finish.",30.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
94416,Fidelitas 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Even in his less-expensive wines, such as this Columbia Valley Merlot, winemaker Charlie Hoppes gets excellent color extraction. Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity. Tart cherry and wild berry flavors quickly give way to thick tannins and barrel flavors of baking chocolate.",25.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
94421,Swanson 2005 Merlot (Oakville),"Nothing subtle about this strongly flavored Merlot, which smacks of perfectly ripened red and black currants, toasty oak and violets. It's a big, flashy, full-bodied wine and also a very tannic one. Best to age for a few years, or at least give it long decanting.",36.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
94874,Domaine Alfred 2005 Chamisal Vineyards Califa Syrah (Edna Valley),"Here's a dense, dramatic young Syrah. It's potent in black currant, cherry, anise and dark chocolate flavors, with plenty of toasty new oak. But more notable is the structure. Fine, ripely sweet tannins, good acidity and moderate alcohol make it balanced and even ageworthy over the next 6 years.",42.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
94876,C. Beck 2005 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"A shade less opulent but finer and more structured than the '04. The tannins are as fine as in any Napa cult Cab, yet the flavors are exotic, with tiers of black currants, red cherries, licorice, dark chocolate, violets, pepper, leather and Chinese mu shu plum sauce. Drink now with substantial roasts; should age for a decade.",38.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
95383,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Washington),"These are still young vines, and showing rather simple, though attractive, fruit flavors of raspberry, strawberry and red currant. Vague hints of pepper and rock suggest good things to come, but for now this is a bit of an underachiever for the price.",36.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
96245,Seven Hills 2005 Ciel du Cheval Red Red (Red Mountain),"A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9–10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more.",30.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
96250,Chatter Creek 2005 Clifton Hill Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit. Viognier skins—not juice—added to the fermenter elevate the aromas with floral and citrus accents. It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak.",38.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
96254,Elyse 2005 Naggiar Vineyard C'est si Bon Red (Sierra Foothills),"Napa-based Elyse is better known for their Cabernet Sauvignon, but they have reached into Nevada County, in the Sierra Foothills, for this lovely Rhône-style blend. It's soft in acidity and the tannins are melted, as you might expect from a warm-to-hot region. But the flavors are plush in jammy cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and crushed black pepper.",28.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
96255,Andrew Rich 2005 Counoise (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Counoise—a southern Rhône blending grape—only rarely appears as a varietal wine, but this distinctive bottling makes a strong case for it. It's not just another generic red wine; it has a particular mouthfeel—elegant, almost Pinot-like—coupled with firm, slightly metallic tannins, sharp acids and accents of pepper on stone. Somehow the wine feels, more than tastes, European.",25.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
96739,Palmeri 2005 Van Ness Vineyard Syrah (Alexander Valley),"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.",53.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
96748,Palmeri 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Tight and hard in tannins now, with a dusty astringency, especially on the finish. But there's a considerable heart of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, accented with complex notes of violets, leather, dried herbs and peppery spices. Not ready now, but should easily negotiate the next 4–6 years.",53.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
97201,Abacela 2005 Merlot (Southern Oregon),"Oregon Merlots have darker fruits and streaks of tar and smoke. Tannins are more aggressive, and must be carefully managed. This wine does a pretty good job of softening up the back end while keeping the richness up front. There is plenty of acid, and the nose carries interesting scents of sandalwood and milk chocolate. It's just a bit chalky on the finish.",18.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
98195,Kenneth Volk 2005 Starr Ranch Vineyard Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"Soft, simple and hot. Tastes like melted cherry pie filling, sprinkled with cocoa, anise and pepper, with a burning finish. Drink now.",36.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
98197,Maddalena 2005 Merlot (Paso Robles),"Hot, soft and simple, with baked fruit flavors of cherries and red currants that turn raisiny on the finish. On the plus side, it's dry and silky.",15.0,82,3,0.966990360015615

98636,Addamo 2005 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A big, rich, full-bodied wine that's kind of like Syrah, but with different flavors. There's a warm, baked pie filling taste of black and red cherries, currants, coconut macaroons, licorice, chocolate and violets, and the finish is very long and richly spicy. At its best now and for a couple more years.",26.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
98748,Leonesse Cellars 2005 Signature Selection Merlot (Temecula Valley),"Good and well-structured, but sweet, with cherry, blackberry, chocolate and anise flavors that taste like they were baked into a pastry.",70.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
98757,Saddleback 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Dry and harsh, almost old-fashioned in its tannic astringency, with a green kick of mint. Relieved by a streak of black cherries and cedar. Drink now.",36.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
100978,Von Strasser 2005 Marcellini Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District),"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity. In this bottling, von Strasser has added Merlot and even Zinfandel to perk things up with dark stone fruit and tannic depth. It's an elegant, dry wine, but at this price, not in the same league as their fabulous Cabernet Sauvignons.",75.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
101008,Boudreaux Cellars 2005 Merlot (Washington),"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind. Some tasters may find it leaning toward the medicinal, but for those who love Rob Newsom's full-speed-ahead style, this is a gorgeous bottle.",40.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
101011,Ramian 2005 Chapter Five Red (Napa Valley),"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",56.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
101299,Hightower 2005 Red Mountain Red Red (Red Mountain),"This well-crafted red wine is supple and smooth. It opens with scents of violets and berries, fills in with round, lush berry and cherry fruit flavors, then applies a wash of milk chocolate to the tannins.",50.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
101697,Benziger 2005 Tribute Red (Sonoma Mountain),"Softly lush, complex in flavor, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend impresses with power and authority. Thoroughly dry and firm in tannins, it shows classic flavors of black currants and cedar, with intricate notes of cherries, violets, tobacco, mocha and beef jerky. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.",80.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
101784,Venge 2005 Estate Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"Feels plush and important as soon as you taste it, not only for the ripe cherry, red currant, cola and spice flavors, but for the structure, which is dry and elegant. However, it's a very young wine, not ready to drink, although that won't stop many people from popping the cork now. Give it through the summer of 2009.",46.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
101922,Alexandria Nicole 2005 Destiny Ridge Vineyards Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a full-throttle style of Merlot, jammy to the point of pruneyness, the flavors broad and loaded with ripe cherries, prunes, smoke, spice, licorice and cedar. Big as the fruit flavors are, the wine is proportionate, the oak applied lightly, the alcohol in balance, and the acids crisp.",27.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
102009,Watts 2005 Los Robles Vineyard Malbec (Clements Hills),"Sugary-sweet and Porty, with high acidity and flavors of candied blackberries and cherries.",20.0,81,3,0.966990360015615

102851,Broman 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"I might have thought there was oak on this wine, it's so rich and vanilla-smoky, but there isn't. Just goes to show. It's dramatic in rich peach, fig, date and ripe green melon, but where does all that butterscotch and crème brûlée come from? The grapes come from a single Beckstoffer-owned vineyard in Rutherford.",16.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
103464,Cakebread 2005 Dancing Bear Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Howell Mountain),"The tannins are holding this Bordeaux blend back now, making it hard and astringent. Even so, the fruit is so powerful, it breaks through to impress. The black currant, cassis and plum jam flavors are complexed with notes of teriyaki beef jerky, cocoa and Asian spices. Could improve considerably in the bottle.",106.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
103475,Hendry 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Crisp acidity and firm tannins give a framework to this massively fruity, rather extracted blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. Without that structure, it would be all jammy cherries and currants. Fine now with a grilled steak, and for the next several years.",35.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
103508,Lookout Ridge 2005 Marco DiGiulio Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth.",100.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
103634,Syncline 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromatic and silky upon entry, this stylish Syrah brings dark berry fruit flavors laced with toast and smoked meats. It's saturated, bright and sappy, with fine grained tannins that seem to spread the flavors fully across the palate. The finish is of medium length, expanding gradually as the wine airs, and adding vanilla and chocolate flavors.",22.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
103636,Walter Dacon 2005 C'est Syrah Belle Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the winery's French-oaked Syrah, thick and smoky, with a balanced mix of red and black fruits, nicely retained acids, and layers of creamy oak. The alcohol hits 14.6% but the wine remains smooth and supple. Barrel flavors expand into a lingering finish with butterscotch, mocha and spice.",28.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
103710,Sineann 2005 Red Table Wine Red (Oregon),"This is a quintessential café red, with a lively, brambly potpourri of fruits and plenty of acid to juice it up. It's fresh and forward and ready to go right now. Nothing too fancy, but plenty of ripe flavor for the price.",16.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
104174,Sonoma Creek 2005 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Very dry and rather tannic, this Merlot strikes off in interesting directions. Along with the usual cherries and blackberries, it shows an array of dried-crushed herb aromas and flavors, such as thyme and sage. This increases balance and complexity, not to mention the wine's versatility at the table.",13.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
104189,Big Ass 2005 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Pretty good price for a Napa Syrah of this quality. It's a pleasantly fruity sipper, immediately appealing for its ripe, fresh blackberry, cherry and leather flavors. Has a level of dry elegance and tannic complexity that lifts it above the ordinary.",15.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
104224,Talus 2005 Merlot (Lodi),"Here's a very fruity wine just brimming with sun-ripened cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors, with a kiss of smoky oak. It's nice, dry and balanced, and a good value for the money.",8.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
104231,Girardet 2005 Grand Rouge Red (Umpqua Valley),"The winery rather coyly refuses to divulge the blend here, saying only that it is a “secret recipe” that contains 14 different Rhône grapes. Whatever. If you are expecting a true grand rouge you are going to be disappointed, for it's more like a rosé, just a bit darker in color. Dry and tart, with fruit flavors of the sort that come with a rosé of Sangiovese for example. Serve well chilled.",14.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
104327,Del Rio 2005 Claret Red (Rogue Valley),"This is a true Claret, in that the blend includes 41% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Franc, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 9% Malbec. It is lushly scented with licorice, tobacco, clove, some plastic and dark fruits, especially black cherry. The fruit and indeed the wine itself has been softened to the point of losing its focus; perhaps an effort to subdue the vineyard's notorious tannins. This is forward and pleasant but a bit diffuse.",35.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
104329,Red Newt Cellars 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"This is an impressive Cab Franc from Red Newt, with bright cherry, violet and pepper spice on the nose and a fresh, lively blend of red fruit in the mouth. The harmonious acid and structure add to the upfront, appealing nature of this wine.",20.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
104340,Bedell 2005 Taste Red Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Easy-drinking and elegant is the word on this appealing red blend. On the nose, raspberry, coffee, cedar and spice lead, with rounded flavors, smooth tannins and a long finish following. A versatile wine with food on its mind—think everything from grilled, herbed chicken to a hearty meat stew.",35.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
104359,Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Ottimino Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A good followup to the 2004, Ottimino's 2005 is exuberantly rich and forward in jammy wild blackberry and cherry flavors, with an array of spicy pepper, clove and anise. Entirely dry, it's wrapped into ripe, firm tannins. Now through 2010.",32.0,90,3,0.966990360015615
104583,Peter Franus 2005 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Good for the winery for producing a Cab Franc that's truly distinct and interesting. It doesn't have a vineyard designation, but it's from the highly regarded Truchard vineyard. With a firm core of dusty tannins and a heart of blackberries, black cherries, currants and black pepper, it's elegant, complex and ageworthy.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
105128,Leal Vineyards 2005 MacWilliamson Vineyard Petite Sirah (San Benito County),"Oodles of rich, ripe fruit in this soft, gently structured wine. The blackberries, cherries, plums, chocolate and spiced coffee finish with evident sweetness.",28.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
106330,Deerfield Ranch 2005 Buchignani Garcia Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Not many people cellar Zinfandel but this is one you might want to for a few years. It's very dry and tannic and extraordinarily dense, with a complex spectrum of red and black currant, pomegranate, molasses cookie, baked cherry pie, root beer, cocoa and peppery spice flavors that go on and on. Shows Zin's full-bodied power, with a fruity sweetness that seduces the palate. Absolutely delicious, but if you're allergic to high alcohol, go elsewhere.",55.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
106332,Viader 2005 Red (Napa Valley),"It is entirely conceivable that this blend of the two Cabernets could improve dramatically with time in the bottle. Currently, it's a very dry, firmly tannic wine, with black currant, mocha, cherry and new oak flavors that have a distinctive edge of sweet herbs, figs and tobacco. Improves considerably with airing in the glass, so decant if you drink it anytime soon.",90.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
106401,Eponymous 2005 MacAllister Vineyard Red (Sonoma Valley),"This is a voluptuous Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's soft, lush and extremely ripe, flooding the mouth with blackberry and cherry jam, cassis, cocoa, sweet fresh green herb and spice flavors. Best now and for a few years, before it sheds its fruit.",46.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
106519,Terlato 2005 Cardinals' Peak Red (Napa Valley),"Very ripe and forward in jammy cherry and blackberry flavors, this blend of Cabernet and Merlot has a milk chocolate edge. It's extracted and not very subtle, but offers a powerhouse of taste.",50.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
106832,White Oak 2005 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Easy to nail this as a Syrah because it's so peppery. Aside from that, it's also so ripe and fruity, it could be Cabernet, with juicy blackberry, cassis, cherry and chocolate flavors.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
107158,Stevens 2005 Black Tongue Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Dineen fruit, in a singular vintage, equals spectacular Syrah. This has it all going on—rich, luscious flavors of berries and cherries, wrapped (soaked!) in chocolate, elevated with zippy acidity and smooth and creamy as fresh-churned butter. Seductive doesn't begin to cover it. You could take a bath in this stuff. Yum!",32.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
108094,Opolo 2005 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"A good wine. It's a little tough and gritty in texture, but shows ripe flavors of black currants, mocha and spices. Finishes sweet and tannic, but not an ager.",30.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
108560,Edizione Pennino 2005 Zinfandel (Rutherford),"You wouldn't know it unless you read the fine print on the back label, but this is from the estate vineyard of Rubicon, Francis Ford Coppola's winery. The wine is rich and complex and quite delicious. It has the mouthfeel of a fine Cab, but the flavor profile is all Zin: savory wild forest berries, tobacco, nettles, anisette, Dr. Pepper and a peacock's tail finish of Asian spices.",40.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
108563,Frazier 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a serious Merlot, a welcome relief from the sea of mediocrity that masquerades under the variety. Grown in the winery's estate vineyard in the southerly Coombville area, the wine shows similarities to Carneros Merlots. Dry, fairly tannic, with crisp acidity and an earthy grounding, it has supple, refined flavors of black cherries, currants, cocoa, violets and cedar.",40.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
108564,Peju 2005 Fifty/Fifty Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very delicious and very young. It combines ripe, plush cassis and cocoa fruit flavor with rich, fine tannins and fine acidity to produce a wine of extraordinary balance. Should develop effortlessly over the next decade.",85.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
108567,Surh Luchtel 2005 Page Nord Vineyard Syrah (Oak Knoll District),"Cab specialist Surh Luchtel has had some years to figure out how to make their Page Nord Syrah, and judging by this '05 bottling, they're right on track. The wine is firmer in structure than the soft '04, but the flavors are no less startling. Blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and pepper flood the palate, wrapped into sumptuous tannins. Best now and for a few years.",30.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
108570,Continuum 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oakville),"Tim Mondavi is back with this interesting Cabernet blend. It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.",130.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
109504,Lincourt 2005 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A solid, middle-of-the-road Syrah, with a gently tannic structure framing blackberry, cherry and blueberry jam, mocha, fig, leather, dried herb and spice flavors.",20.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
109509,Skylite 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Minnick and Ash Hollow grapes, this is a punchy, high-toned take on Syrah. Particularly attractive are the bright raspberry flavors, peppered with, well, pepper! It's got the kind of verve that you find in a simple Grenache, and finishes light and tangy.",32.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
111201,Col Solare 2005 Red Table Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Twenty percent of the fruit in this 2005 comes from Red Mountain grapes—though not yet from the newly planted estate vineyard. Rich, ripe, smooth and supple, this nicely styled blend is packed with good dark fruits and sweet berry jam flavors. It's supple and muscular, with well-modulated tannins, and layered flavors of earth, soy and black tea.",75.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
111205,Iron Horse 2005 Wedding Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"The Wedding Cuvée is one of Iron Horse's sweeter bubblies, but it's not a sweet wine. It's soft, creamy and delicious. Brimming with flavors of green apples, strawberries, brioche and pepper, it continues the winery's brilliant tradition of crafting some of the finest sparkling wines in California.",38.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
111212,Januik 2005 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"A complete and expressive wine, with vibrant berry/cherry fruit, supple textures and a gentle hand with the oak. The tannins have been well managed and mediated; the wine is tannic but smooth with no roughness or excessively green flavors. It captures just a hint of pepper and herb, and is streaked with coffee highlights through the finish.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
111217,Januik 2005 Lewis Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has the sharp, spicy excellence of the best Washington Syrahs; it's got precision, depth and texture. The fruit flavors are compact, buttressed with earthy flavors that include iron and mineral and herb. There is a leafy edge to the tannins suggestive of tobacco. It's a complex and fascinating wine that should age well.",30.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
111285,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"Disgorged in October 2015, this sparkler opens with sublime green-apple tones, offering both tartness and stony minerality. A crisp, lemony mousse adds freshness and vibrancy to the complex hazelnut and brioche characteristics. This wine has long legs and memorable completeness.",75.0,94,3,0.966990360015615
111325,Lost River 2005 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cool fermented in stainless steel and whole cluster pressed, this lively take on Pinot Gris offers rich pear fruit flavors, succulent and fresh. It's a big, ripe, solid effort, with a lovely juicy quality that fills the mouth with a burst of just-picked flavor.",14.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
111330,Tablas Creek 2005 Côtes de Tablas Red (Paso Robles),"This is Côtes-du-Rhône, California style. A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.",20.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
111986,:Nota Bene 2005 Una Notte Red (Washington),"This is a spicy and fragrant red wine, the 63% Grenache dominating the fruit, and the 37% Syrah filling in the back with peppery tannins. At first the flavors are tight and compressed, a mix of blackberry, cherry, plum and more, along with streaks of espresso. As the acids wind their way down the throat, they take on strong citrus flavors of lemon, pineapple and orange peel.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
111990,Doyenne 2005 Aix Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2005 Doyenne Aix is 50% Cabernet, 48% Syrah and 2% Mourvèdre. The increased percentage of Syrah and the extra dollop of Mourvèdre ramps this up to a stiffer, more substantial wine than the 2004. It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rhône-like savage-ness from the Mourvèdre, especially in the aroma. The tannins are chewy and a bit leafy, and need some airing out, but there's plenty of meaty flavor here.",38.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
111992,Adelaida 2005 The Glenrose Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Adelaida is assembling a good track record with this wine. It's from the cooler western portion of the appellation, so that crisp acidity provides a fine framework for the slightly sweet tropical fruit, wildflower and spice flavors. With its exotic personality, it's best paired with strongly flavored, complex dishes that combine poultry, game or shellfish with fruits, nuts and honey.",30.0,89,3,0.966990360015615
112006,JM Cellars 2005 Columbia Valley Cuvée Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Columbia Valley Cuvée is JM Cellars' Bordeaux blend of Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc.  Fragrant and seductive, spicy and deep, it's loaded with wild berry fruit flavors, dried herbs and hints of rock. The new oak is not intrusive, the acids are balanced, and the finish is light and smooth.",32.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
112009,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dark, smoky and herbal, this wine, the second Malbec from Maryhill, does capture some of that grape's lovely character. Tart wild berry fruit is cut with sharp acids, and laced with herb and hints of stone. There is a bit of saddle leather showing through the tannins, but not so much as to wipe out the sweet fruit. A persistent finish tastes like fresh picked raspberries.",40.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
112010,Moffett 2005 Syrah (Oak Knoll District),"Made in a cool part of Napa Valley in a cool vintage, this Syrah is very dry and tough in youthful tannins. It's too astringent to offer much pleasure now, but has a great heart of ripe blackberry, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, anise and pepper flavor that should sweeten and emerge as the wine ages. Try holding until after 2009.",40.0,88,3,0.966990360015615
112097,Sterling 2005 SVR Reserve Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Ripe and deep in berry, currant, cassis and spice flavors, with a rich overlay of cedary oak. Shows some roughness in midpalate and tannic astringency on the finish. Good, but edgy and a little harsh. Contains some Petite Sirah and Syrah.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
112165,Mayacamas 2005 Merlot (Mount Veeder),"Dry, tough in tannins and acidic, this Merlot isn't offering much now. Despite a rich, concentrated vein of cherries, it's a hard, almost old-fashioned wine. Your best bet is to age it, but no guarantees. Try after 2012.",35.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
112838,Frostwatch 2005 Zinfandel (Bennett Valley),"Crushed peppercorn aromas mark this dry, full-bodied Zin, along with all sorts of other racy spices. The alcohol is moderate, and the flavors kick in midpalate, suggesting berries, currants, tobacco, leather and coffee. A very nice example of a balanced, Sonoma Zinfandel with classic elegance.",26.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
113590,Marilyn Merlot 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Can't miss this bottle on the shelf, with La Monroe herself giving that come-hither look. The wine too is soft and fleshy. With 12% Cabernet Sauvignon to give some punch, it has uplifted blackberry, cherry, dark chocolate and smoke flavors, and is totally dry.",27.0,87,3,0.966990360015615
113668,Benessere 2005 Phenomenon Red (Napa Valley),"Quite a good wine. It's luscious in creamy flavors of blackberries, cherries and toast, and also beautifully balanced. You feel the elegant interplay of oak, tannins and acidity. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.",60.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
113963,Rezonja 2005 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"Feels almost Porty, with a hot, harsh mouthfeel and flavors of dessicated grapes and grapeskin tannins dominating the blackberries and currants. Could age out, if you're a gambler.",24.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
113976,Rezonja 2005 Eleganten Red (Alexander Valley),"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is harsh and tannic, with baked berry and currant flavors. May be technically dry, but tastes sugary sweet.",40.0,83,3,0.966990360015615
114049,Wilson 2005 Ellie's Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The official alcohol is only 14.6%, not all that high, but the wine has a hot, Porty mouthfeel. It also tastes of overripe raisins, and finishes with a burning, chili pepper quality.",32.0,82,3,0.966990360015615
114547,Northstar 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Columbia Valley designated Merlot from Northstar accounts for six times as many cases as its Walla Walla Merlot, yet in quality terms it sometimes equals or even surpasses the pricier bottling. The 2005 vintage was stellar, and this lovely wine is bursting with fruit—raspberry, blackberry, plum and more. Spicy aromas and flavors wrap around chocolaty tannins; there are exotic hints of curry and plenty of toast.",41.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
114700,Miner 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Ripe and dry, with smooth flavors of cherries, violets, plum sauce, carob and spice. But turns bitter and sharp toward the finish, with an espresso scour.",40.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
114723,Clautiere 2005 BDX Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles),"All fruit and little structure. Blasts the palate with blackberries, cherries, chocolate, currant, vanilla and pastry flavors that are functionally sweet. Acidity is soft, emphasizing the glyceriney sweetness.",35.0,84,3,0.966990360015615
115204,Newton 2005 The Puzzle Red (Spring Mountain District),"A Bordeaux blend from Newton's mountain estate, this lovely wine starts out with a fat, fleshy appeal. It offers elaborate waves of sweetly smoked oak that conjoin nicely with cherry preserves, red licorice and dark chocolate. A bit inelegant now due to firm, fierce tannins, but so balanced, it should easily negotiate the years. Better after 2012.",80.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
115800,Gargiulo 2005 Aprile Red (Oakville),"Sangiovese has been a major disappointment in Napa Valley, but guess what? This 97% Sangiovese, with 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, is an impressive wine, and the best of Gargiulo's current releases. It's enormously forward in cherry pastry filling flavors, while plenty of new oak adds smoky, cinnamon spicy, vanilla brulée complexities, but it's the quality of the tannins that marks the wine. For all its flamboyance, it doesn't seem like an ager. Best now through 2011.",40.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
115804,Morgan 2005 Tierra Mar Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Pepper, acidity and tannins are the stars of this young, unresolved Syrah. Under all that is a solid core of blackberries and blueberries that have a slight baked quality, like fruit in a pie. The wine needs time to knit together. A blend mainly of Morgan's cool Double L Vineyard and the fine Paraiso Vineyard, at the warmer, opposite end of the appellation, it should hit its stride in mid-2009.",40.0,93,3,0.966990360015615
115814,Stephanie 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.",65.0,92,3,0.966990360015615
116009,Marimar Estate 2005 Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempraillo Red (Russian River Valley),"Marimar Torres frankly calls the planting of these 2 varieties in her estate vineyard, which had previously been to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, experimental. Much work needs to be done to perfect them. The wine, as it stands, is dry and acidic and one-dimensional in cherry and currant fruit. It requires greater levels of complexity and nuance.",32.0,85,3,0.966990360015615
116408,Hyatt 2005 Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills),"Simple but meaty, this 100% Merlot has substantial weight in the midpalate. There are plenty of powerful herbal flavors, yet the grapes seem ripe enough, offering prune and cassis and a little pepper from aging in American oak.",10.0,86,3,0.966990360015615
116473,Balboa 2005 Mith Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The third vintage of Mith is the best yet, composed of fruit from three top-notch Walla Walla vineyards. It's two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah. The wine opens seductively with luscious blueberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit, wrapped in sexy layers of earth and herb. Whiffs of smoke lead into a silky smooth, chocolaty finish.",40.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
116484,Reininger 2005 Ash Hollow Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This pure Syrah from Reininger's estate vineyard has the focus and also the tightness that often characterize single-vineyard wines. There are dense flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, plenty of natural acid, along with polished tannins and a soothing layer of toasty oak, that helps smooth the rough edges and buff up the finish. Hints of earth, leaf and tar add detail and interest all the way through a lingering finish.",41.0,91,3,0.966990360015615
334,Ceago Vinegarden 2001 Kathleen's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish.",19.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
344,Vinoce 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end.",18.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
2445,Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley),"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",14.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
2449,Signorello 2001 Seta Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",25.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
6654,Elk Cove 2001 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"A tart, flinty and apple-y rendition of Riesling, one that's lean and light, one that leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after swallowing or spitting. One that would make a particularly pleasant aperitif.",12.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
6673,Rosenblum 2001 Gallagher Ranch Black Muscat (California),"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge. It has a nice chocolatey edge that would be a good partner with dark chocolate desserts. Finishes clean and with good acidity.",18.0,85,3,0.9647071779172094
6811,Pepperwood Grove 2001 Viognier (California),"Simple and watery, with vaguely fruity flavors of peaches and citrus. Very dry, with adequate acidity.",9.0,83,3,0.9647071779172094
7027,Columbia Winery 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is one of Columbia's strengths, turning out perfectly crafted white wines at budget prices. The Gewürz is off-dry, rich and roundly fruity, loaded with mouthfilling, lipsmacking flavors. Chill it to cut the sweetness and you have the perfect wine for spicy noodle dishes.",7.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
7028,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too.",8.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
7032,Columbia Crest 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A wonderfully fragrant nose mixes scents of fresh fruits and  blossoms, with a sweet and tart flavor profile. These are very user friendly flavors, ripe and round, with more fatness than most Washington Rieslings, especially at this price. Best Buy.",7.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
10952,Pride Mountain 2001 Viognier (Sonoma County),"From Pride's estate 2,100 feet up in the Mayacamas, another in a string of impressive Viogniers. Follows the pattern of tempering the varietal's over the top character with barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a wine with the density of a big Chardonnay, but with Viognier's rich, yummy array of fruity flavors.",40.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
13056,Mumm Napa 2001 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"A gorgeous, Champagne-like sparkling wine. As good as the 2000, it's rich and silky, with a very fine mousse and rich citrus and yeast flavors. Needs time. Give it at least five or six years in the bottle, if you can keep your hands off.",55.0,94,3,0.9647071779172094
20294,J. Lohr 2001 Carol's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A faint perfume of pear can be caught on the otherwise dull nose. The flavors run toward candied pear, honeydew and peach. There's some spiciness to the finish, but also a watery quality that doesn't do much for the wine. In the end, it doesn't hit the varietal mark squarely.",18.0,84,3,0.9647071779172094
20306,Bridgeview 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Oregon),"The nose is forward and somewhat disjointed, a broad mix of fruit, herb and wood. Flavors of stem and dill are there, along with soft, grapey fruit.",10.0,84,3,0.9647071779172094
21693,Babcock 2001 Eleven Oaks Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Tasted twice, with divergent results; the 86 rating reflects the average of both bottles. One bottle seemed overly heavy, with an odd mix of jalapeño peppers and honey. The better (and hopefully more representative) bottle showed richness without excessive weight, hints of cream and toast and penetrating citrus flavors, and would have rated 89 points on its own.",23.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
22869,Standing Stone 2001 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Smells rich and decadent, with aromas of orange marmalade and honey, but still maintains refreshing touches of citrus and pineapple throughout. It's thick and rich in the mouth, and finishes long, with excellent balance. This can easily compete with Canadian ice wines.",32.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
22873,Smith-Madrone 2001 Riesling (Napa Valley),"California's best Riesling grown for 25 years at 1,800 feet above Napa Valley. Crisp and concentrated flavors of apples, lime and minerals are encased in fine acidity and drink steely and sleek. The residual sugar us 0.7%, which is off-dry, but the acids are so good, the wine feels dry in the mouth. By the way, this wine will age for a long time.",17.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
26416,Silvan Ridge 2001 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Fairly light and innocuous; you really have to make an effort to draw anything from the nose. The palate is sweet and sugary, especially for Pinot Gris, which should be more dry and snappy. And that sweetness carries onto the finish and all the way out the back door. Not offensive, but overly sweet and thick given the grape and origin.",14.0,83,3,0.9647071779172094
26424,Silvan Ridge 2001 Del Rio Vineyards Viognier (Rogue Valley),"While not smelling much like typical Viognier, this southern Oregon offering is round, sweet and ripe, with honey and apple flavors. The finish is sweet and honeyed, and also quite short. A chunky, full-bodied mouthfeel is the most typical characteristic of the wine.",18.0,82,3,0.9647071779172094
26425,Madroña 2001 Riesling (El Dorado),"Quite viscous, with creamy peach, melon and pear flavors at its core. An odd mineral note sticks out, though, while the finish could use a touch more acidity.",10.0,82,3,0.9647071779172094
26431,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2001 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Flat but clean, with very light and distant apricot and celery aromas. The flavors veer toward green apple and lemon, while the finish is bland. From a texture standpoint, it's watery, with only modest fruit quality.",13.0,82,3,0.9647071779172094
33030,Dutton-Goldfield 2001 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Wickedly, sinfully good. This is fruit detonation in the mouth, a blast of pure, sweet cassis, currant, plum and chocolate. The tannins are a velvety wonder, the oak lavish and thick, but perfectly in balance to the size. Opulent and hedonistic, it's best in its sensual, seductive youth.",35.0,93,3,0.9647071779172094
33045,L'Aventure 2001 Optimus Red (Paso Robles),"From Rhône-possessed Paso Robles, an adventurous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel. The aroma is subdued now, closed and brooding. On the palate is an explosion of cassis, briar, chocolate and coffee. Sweet, ripe tannins make for a dusty mouthfeel. Needs a minimum of a year in the cellar.",45.0,92,3,0.9647071779172094
33049,Bonny Doon 2001 Vin de Glacière Muscat (California),"It's a blast of apricot chutney sweetened with smoky honey and a sprinkle of vanilla. The texture is glyceriney and creamy. It's very sweet, but has orange-zesty acidity that keeps it from being cloying.",17.0,92,3,0.9647071779172094
33050,"EOS 2001 Cupa Grandis, Peck Ranch Vineyard Block P7 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)","With this thick, dark wine, the folks from EOS have pumped up the volume. It's super soft and supple, with velvety tannins and lots of black cherry, coffee, chocolate, herb, spice, vanilla, toast and earth flavors. The wine also has some high-toned qualities that bright up on the finish.",40.0,92,3,0.9647071779172094
33052,Renwood 2001 Grandmere Zinfandel (Amador County),"The tannins are so ripe and sweet, so soft and intricate, in this decadently fruity, feminine wine. It has flavors of ripe blackberries, dusted with cocoa and sprinkled with tangerine zest. This is seriously good stuff, and impossible to resist.",25.0,92,3,0.9647071779172094
34429,WillaKenzie Estate 2001 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"I don't know anyone making better Pinot Gris in Oregon than this premiere property.

38762,Tucker 2001 Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This wine starts off well, with a pretty nose and fruit that shows nice ripeness. But once in the mouth all the fruit seems to disappear, and the wine falls flat.",8.0,83,3,0.9647071779172094

39325,Babcock 2001 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),"A combination of grapes from around the county has produced a complex, nuanced wine. It has that dry-sweet thing going on, with no measurable sugar but layers of fruity, flowery flavors, and quite bright acids. It feels fat and oily in the mouth, and even has a touch of spicy oak. Best Buy. —S.H.",14.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
39333,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Idaho),"Off-dry fruit conjures up flavors of grapes, apricots, peaches and even kumquats! A balanced, sensuous wine, it has no rough acid or over-the-top tropical fruit flavors. Long and silky. Best Buy. —P.G.",6.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
39335,Waterbrook 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Waterbrook makes a  lovely, lighthearted, citrus- and melon-flavored Sauv Blanc.

39343,Seven Hills 2001 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fragrant, with scents and flavors of pears and orange blossoms. This wine has 1.8% residual sugar, which qualifies it as off-dry, but it is still quite suitable for a wide range of foods, especially spicy Asian dishes. Full, fleshy and well-made, it delivers plenty of fresh fruit flavor with enough spice and acid to give a lift to the finish.",10.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
39344,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Dry Riesling (Idaho),"Riesling has always been a strength of this winery, and this wine clearly shows why. It has a lightness and delicacy missing from most other domestic Riesling, yet it is not simple. Its complex, subtle, food-friendly flavors are right on the money. Best Buy. —P.G.",6.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
39372,CE2V 2001 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Smells simple, with vague notes of citrus fruits, but just the opposite in the mouth.

41776,Wattle Creek 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"Pretty scents of grapefruit, green apple and wild flowers rise up from the glass, followed by tasty citrus in the form of orange, lemon and grapefruit.

41789,Henry Estate 2001 Müller-Thurgau (Umpqua Valley),"This is a quaffable (about 10% alcohol), off, dry white wine, with intense, clean, lovely floral flavors. Citrus and citrus blossom mingle, making it almost like a still version of Prosecco. There is a surprisingly long finish with spicy floral flavors, intense and flavorful.",9.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
41796,Frog's Leap 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Light and clean in the nose, with attractive hints of nutmeg and other baking spices.

41826,Beringer 2001 Nouveau Red (California),"This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value.",8.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094

41839,Geyser Peak 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (California),". Racy and strong, and comes down firmly on the grass, hay and grapefruit side, brimming with bright, tart fruit. A touch of sugar puts it just this side of sweet, with an intriguing taste of white chocolate on the finish. Gets the nod because it's so ultra-clean and zesty. —S.H.",10.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
41843,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Soft Chenin Blanc (Idaho),"By “soft” the winery means sweet. This is a low-acid style, showing flavors of pear, melon and mango. It's a good sipping wine, but perhaps a bit too soft for most foods. —P.G.",6.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094

44343,St. Supéry 2001 Sweet White Moscato (California),"On the nose, lively peach and tropical fruit aromas are kept in check by a cottony-chalky note. Not at all cloying, this Moscato is well balanced, with plenty of mango flavors. Finishes with garden-sweet honeysuckle and sunflower notes. Though Beaulac recommends it with spicy food (especially Thai), we think it'd be just as nice to sip on the beach.",15.0,89,3,0.9647071779172094
44359,St. Supéry 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Very fresh and light, with just a bit of a resiny mouthfeel, this Sauvignon Blanc sees only stainless steel. White stone fruit, pear and citrus flavors dominate; flint and steel notes give the fruit substantial backbone.

45494,Pepi 2001 Pinot Grigio (Willamette Valley),"Aromas of snap peas and minerals come in front of grapefruit, apple and lemon flavors. This wine has both a stony, crisp core as well as a plump, chewy texture. The finish is at once tangy and lean, but also fairly driven.

45503,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Sweet and honeyed, but with enough tongue-tingling acidity to keep it almost in check, this is a well-made sweet table wine. Aromas and flavors blend tangerines and ripe apples.",12.0,85,3,0.9647071779172094
45507,Sokol Blosser 2001 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Aromas of white pepper and pear start it off, and it smells snappy and inviting. The palate is all about grapefruit and orange; in a word, it's citrusy. The finish comes in waves, with notes of stone fruit and licorice. As a whole it's round and satisfying, but it's also a tad bit dilute and dull, which is why it rates where it does.",18.0,85,3,0.9647071779172094

56298,Amador Foothill Winery 2001 Ferrero Vineyard Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Extracted and jammy in black cherries and black raspberries, with hints of cocoa, this wine is fully dry and balanced. It tasty through the smooth finish.",15.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
57342,Iron Horse 2001 T bar T Cuvée R White (Alexander Valley),"This blend has 80% Viognier, which adds a peach and apricot streak that adds interest to the lemony, grapefruity flavors. Drinks tart, bone dry and clean, with sleek acidity. A terrific, elegant wine, perfect for a first course, and a great offering from this top producer. Editors' Choice.",19.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
57370,Andretti 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Shows unusual depth and finesse for a Sauvignon Blanc, with scads of palate impressions ranging from lemondrop candy, zesty wintergreen, apricot nectar and white pepper. Yet it's dry and smooth, with crisp acids.",14.0,89,3,0.9647071779172094
58398,Woodward Canyon 2001 Dry White Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A limited-production wine, made in a bone-dry style. It is at once searingly tart and loaded with fresh, tangy lemon and citrus and green apple fruit. It shows terrific concentration and focus, and lingers in the back palate, begging for some spicy food to wash down.",22.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
58410,Willow Crest 2001 Black Muscat (Yakima Valley),"Ripe, forward scents of plums and apricots. This is concentrated but not syrupy, fleshy and ripe but not cloying or too sweet. Delicious sipping wine.",8.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
58416,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Dry Gewürztraminer (Idaho),"This is quite dry, as the label indicates, and nicely scented with light floral notes. Citrus fruit flavors run through an elegant, textured wine that definitely wants food to go with. Best Buy. —P.G.",6.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
59378,Rochioli 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"In this vintage, one of Sonoma's top SBs scores points in all the requisite areas. A tiny bit of talc softens the tropical fruit bouquet. More exotic fruit is on the palate, highlighted by firm edges and some citrus rind. A bit of banana sweetens the long, dry finish, leaving you with the right overall impression.",24.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
61179,Saracina 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"Refreshing and zesty, with peach, grass, juniper berry and grapefruit flavors that drink a little sweet, although crisp acidity cleanses and soothes the palate. This nice cocktail wine is fun and easy to drink.",24.0,84,3,0.9647071779172094
61182,Woodbridge 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Shows plenty of varietal character. Spearmint, lemon and lime flavors, with a crisp, tart texture and a rich, spicy finish. Pleasant to drink and a good value. Best Buy.",6.0,84,3,0.9647071779172094
61765,Bernardus 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"What a great wine this is. It combines Chardonnay's rich, creamy texture with Sauvignon Blanc's dry, tart, lemony flavors to yield a complex wine that's a joy to drink. The acidic, peppery finish begs for food to accompany it. A very great value.",15.0,89,3,0.9647071779172094
61772,Deerfield Ranch 2001 Peterson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"A very good white wine, perfectly dry, with streamlined flavors of grapefruit, fig and lime, and creamy, vanilla complexities from barrel fermentation. Appealing in the mouth, and near as good as California Sauvignon Blanc gets.",18.0,89,3,0.9647071779172094
62911,J Vineyards & Winery 2001 Late Disgorged Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful wine, fully resolved in age, showing a classy, smooth mouthfeel. The citrus, bread dough, vanilla and spice flavors are subtle but delicious, while the bubbles have softened, making the wine creamy. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, this delicious bubbly is made for drinking now.",90.0,93,3,0.9647071779172094
64934,Rosenblum 2001 Samsel Vineyard/Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Big and lush, this one's got gobs of chocolate, plum, spice, black cherry, spice, coffee, herb, toast, and vanilla, all framed in creamy smooth tannins that give a supple quality to the blend. Long, lush and smooth at the end.",42.0,90,3,0.9647071779172094
65931,Elk Cove 2001 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Pinot gris as it should be — ripe and full-bodied, with expressive flavors of fresh pears, spiced with cinnamon. Rich and satisfying, yet tangy enough to accompany even delicate seafood. This is a home run, with just enough of a hint of barrel to give it a finishing kiss of butterscotch.",15.0,91,3,0.9647071779172094
69522,Anapamu 2001 Riesling (Monterey County),"Showing moderate body and made in a drier style, the wine offers a hint of earthiness that's followed by pretty melon, peach, herb and citrus flavors. Crisp and clean on the finish, with a toasty, fruity hint at the end. More complex than   many of the local Rieslings.",16.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
69533,Montinore 2001 Late Harvest - Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),"The bright gold color and botrytis aromas tell you right off the bat that this is late-harvest juice. In the mouth, the extract and thickness are that of Vendanges Tardives Alsace whites, and flavor-wise, there's quince, peach and cinnamon, along with more botrytis and white raisins. Quite interesting for the region and a solid take on European-style late-harvest Gewurz. Possibly best with blue cheese or foie gras.",9.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
70650,Canyon Road 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Stays true to its house style, with intensely grassy, herbal flavors of mint, citrus and hay. Extremely dry with bright acidity, it's a zesty clean wine, very refreshing and invigorating, and a good value. Best Buy.—S.H.",9.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
70667,Gordon Brothers 2001 Katie's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"No visible vintage date on the bottle, but the winery says it's a 2001. Tart and lemony, with crisp acids, it tends toward bland, with simple, green apple fruit.",12.0,85,3,0.9647071779172094
74393,Bedell 2001 Late Harvest Riesling Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),"It's picked late, when the grapes are superripe, then winemaker Kip Bedell puts them in a freezer prior to crush to further concentrate the resulting must. The result is a thick, gooey, unctuous dessert wine with flavors of tangerines and honey. Yum.",35.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
74398,Greenwood Ridge 2001 Estate Bottled White Riesling (Mendocino Ridge),"Almost fleshy textured, the wine is broad on the palate yet offers good acidity for balance. Grapefruit, lemon, melon, pineapple, apple and herb flavors are blended nicely here in a fine-tuned, elegant style. Fruit driven, but not overly sweet.",12.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
74399,Montinore 2001 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Melon and citrus aromas get this soft, ripe and round wine going. The palate is full and plump, with bold citrus and tropical flavors and a welcome textural creaminess. The finish is smooth and supple, and as a whole this wine covers all the bases while showing itself to be a more than capable food accompaniment.",10.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
80744,Caterina 2001 Willard Family Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Re-released just now, the wine is already mature, its fruit fading, leaving notes of dried leaves, pipe tobacco and coffee grounds.",20.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
82485,Zenaida Cellars 2001 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Earthy, smoky aromas with a hint of bacon turn gluey and artifically sweet in the mouth, with the taste of cherry cough syrup. An acceptable wine.",21.0,81,3,0.9647071779172094
82487,Stonehedge 2001 Petite Sirah (California),"Dark and earthy, a thick, heavy wine with plummy, chocolatey flavors and big tannins, although the acidity is soft. The main drawback is residual sugar. Once that sugar hits, the palate is discombobulated.",10.0,81,3,0.9647071779172094
85998,Elk Cove 2001 Del Rio Viognier (Rogue Valley),"The melon, apple and pear aromas aren't as distinctively Viognier as one might expect, but the wine itself is solid and satisfying. The flavor profile is spicy and melony, and feel-wise there's lots of size. (This whopper weighs in at 14.9%, so it should seem big.)  A large, chewy yet mildly buttery finish seals the package as full bodied and rich.",22.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
87342,Jamesport 2001 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"This rare library release from Jamesport is another great testament to how age worthy Long Island wine can be. At 12 years of age, it's remarkably fresh, with crisp, red cherry and plum flavors, layered with shades of clay, savory herbs and brine. Lively with acidity, it's powerful on the palate but elegant in style.",25.0,88,3,0.9647071779172094
95385,The Seven Brothers 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Clear Lake),"Melon, citrus and herb notes are well balanced in this pleasing, refreshing, light wine. Bright and fresh to the end, it's perfect for summer quaffing.",12.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
95397,Murphy-Goode 2001 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"A perky little white wine, dry as dust, with lemon and lime flavors that are boosted by bright acidity. Spreads over the palate with a tart pepperiness, an ideal food wine. It's also a good value.",13.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
97637,Gary Farrell 2001 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.",20.0,87,3,0.9647071779172094
98010,Nicolaysen Family Vineyards 2001 Late Harvest Alisos Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County),"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",50.0,95,3,0.9647071779172094
101693,Schramsberg 2001 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"Pretty much as gorgeous as California bubbly gets. It's dry and yeasty and rich in citrus, peach and apple flavors, with an enormously fine structure. Feels smooth as silk, clean as a whistle, with a delicate but complex mousse. Young and vibrant, with mouthwatering acidity, this Champagne-like brut should develop bottle complexity through 2013, at least.",100.0,95,3,0.9647071779172094
112731,Paschal 2001 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),"Maybe southern Oregon is too hot for white wines; at least it appears to be based on this flat, rather lifeless offering. The nose is like applesauce, while the palate is bland and lazy, with only a modicum of grapefruit working in its favor. A little banana and citrus pith on the finish save it from a worse fate.",18.0,80,3,0.9647071779172094
112745,Treana 2001 Mer Soleil Vineyard White (Central Coast),"From the northernmost vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a fantastically interesting wine. Complex and compelling, with brilliant fruit flavors spanning the range from apricots and limes to peaches and guava. All this juicy flavor is boosted by bright and beautiful acidity. Viognier 61%, Marsanne 39%.",25.0,93,3,0.9647071779172094
114577,Waugh Cellars 2001 Susy's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"So ripe and soft, it's hard to believe this is Sauvignon Blanc. Anise-tinged guava, pear and other ripe tree fruits mingle on the palate, finishing gently. Its delicate and low-acid nature argues for drinking soon, probably on its own.",18.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
114579,Napa Wine Co. 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Oakville),"Basic grapefruit and white peach aromas give way to a palate that's mostly about lemon and melon. This wine seems to have gone through far too severe a barrel regimen, and to us, popcorn and butter just don't complement most Sauvignon Blancs.",18.0,85,3,0.9647071779172094
114709,Raphael 2001 Estate Bottled Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"Several years of aging has brought out some nice leather and barnyard tones that blend well with the raspberry and cherry fruit. Pleasant vanilla notes grace the moderately long and gripping finish. Although it was quite pretty when first opened, this wine declines in the glass and should therefore be drunk up as soon as possible. Try with smoked meats.",25.0,86,3,0.9647071779172094
345,Merriam 2000 Windacre Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.",34.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
346,Murphy-Goode 2000 Reserve Fume Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay.",17.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
351,Bridlewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",12.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
6662,Abacela 2000 Cabernet Franc (Oregon),"Rustic and funky, with a curious nose sending up scents of fruit, musk, soy, pepper and espresso. Flavors are vivid and grapey, and there is a penetrating spicy note running throughout. The finish is tannic and rough.",20.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
6667,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",35.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
6669,Maddalena 2000 Merlot (Central Coast),"Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine.",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
6675,Redwood 2000 Merlot (California),"A pleasant sipper at a nice price, this fruity wine has flavors of cherries and plums, and is soft and rich. Has more complexity and depth than you'd think, and is a very good value.",9.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
7015,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Fumé Blanc (Idaho),"The winery's penchant for delicate, lightly balanced wines is again evident here. This has some pleasant herb flavors, gentle nuances of grass and citrus. Cleanly made and finished with a touch of spice. —P.G.",10.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
7021,Sariah Cellars 2000 Syrah (Red Mountain),"Add this new winery to the growing list of Walla Walla-based boutiques. The Syrah is plump and juicy, a round, fruity red wine that is perfectly enjoyable. —P.G.",25.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
7023,Mayo 2000 Ricci Vineyard Unfiltered Zinfandel Port Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Mayo knows how to make sweetish Zins that should be dry. Here's their effort at an outrightly sweet Zin, and it ain't bad. Curranty, raisiny aromas lead to cassis and blackberry jam flavors that are immensely ripe, and the sugar level is dessert-high. It's warmly satisfying. Try with, or over, vanilla ice cream, and be happy. —S.H.",30.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
7035,Gargiulo 2000 Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Oakville),"Kicks off with pretty cherry notes in the nose. Dry and bright on the palate, the wine shows lovely ripe Bing cherry flavors, elegant citrus and clean mineral notes. A refreshing and satisfying rosé.",13.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
10946,Darioush 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich and lush, with smoky, charry overtones and pretty blackberry, plum, chocolate, coffee, herb and toast flavors. The wine shows moderate body and silky tannins. Long, rich and enticing on the finish.",44.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
10950,Alban 2000 Roussanne (Central Coast),"A startingly interesting wine that opens with powerful aromas of peaches and all sort of meaty, beefy, truffly and mushroomy complexities. Marked by crisp, vibrant acids that boost the stone fruit flavors and make them punchy. Dry, complex and compelling.",25.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
10954,Zaca Mesa 2000 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A nice mouthful of Syrah, rich and full-bodied. Drinks dry and rather tannic, with plummy, blackberry, peppery flavors. But it's very complex. If you use your imagination, you can find anise, white chocolate, bacon, and all sorts of other things. Dry, rich, and long in the finish, a distinctive wine that pushes the reputation of this valley for Syrah.",20.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
10968,Bridlewood 2000 Syrah (Central Coast),"An interesting wine, not without problems. Pours intensely dark, and opens with aromas ranging from blackberries to  earth and white pepper. In the mouth, straddles the ripeness line, with deliciously fruity flavors kept in check by an herbal edge. A blend of Paso Robles, Edna Valley and Santa Ynez Valley.",19.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
11684,Cedar Mountain 2000 Late Bottled Vintage Port Port (California),"This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too.",40.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
15038,Rex Hill 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"It's hard to get very excited about this wine because it's so average and common. It smells weakly of lemons, and the citrus flavors are watery and thin. It's dry and although there's some good acidity, it feels flat in the mouth. That says it all.",14.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
15041,Kahn 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Unless you just love oak, this one is way too woody. Buttered toast, creamed corn and popcorn aromas are seconded on the palate by thick, cloying buttery flavors and very little fruit. Not appealing.",16.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
15048,Edgewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Hay, cabbage and pickles in the nose? That's not what most of us are seeking. The palate is overtly grassy, bordering on weedy. A slight spritz to the mouthfeel neither helps nor hinders it. Beyond that, there's not much else to say.",20.0,81,3,0.9573912533610714
17117,Covey Run 2000 Chenin Blanc (Washington),"Almost no one makes a dry chenin anymore. This is off-dry, fruity and simple, showing nothing of the complexity this grape can achieve if treated right. Citrusy fruit, slightly sugary finish.",7.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
17124,Columbia Winery 2000 Cellarmaster's Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Yellow in color and thick in the bouquet. The nose is hard to peg, but there are notes of mustard and asparagus. The palate offers some orange and apple flavors, but also something similar to canned peas. It seems overripe and past its prime.",7.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
17131,Provenance Vineyards 2000 Merlot (Carneros),"Top flight Merlot, brimming with ripe black cherry, blackberry, chocolate, smoke, sage, thyme, anise and pepper notes. It's all framed in silky ripe tannins, smooth, sleek and lush. The finish is long. -J.M.",28.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
17530,Schramsberg 2000 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"Right up there with the recent string of fabulous têtes de cuvées, the 2000 shows the concentration, power and subtlety of this, the winery's top release. A blend of Chardonnay with 20% Pinot Noir, it shows exotic and complex flavors of tangerines and raspberries, candied ginger, coconut macaroons, baked bread and yeast. It's delicious now, but all the parts haven't come together. Hold until mid-2008 through 2010, but could go well beyond that.",90.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
20289,Rancho Zabaco 2000 Dancing Bull Zinfandel (California),"A simple, fruity Zin that blends damp soil and stewed berries with chocolate and toast. Mostly Lodi fruit, with bits and pieces of the blend coming from Mendocino, Sonoma and Paso Robles; also contains traces of Petite Sirah and Syrah.",12.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
20295,Chateau St. Jean 2000 La Petite Etoile Vineyard Fumé Blanc (Russian River Valley),"This is the liquid version of buttered toast. It's that oaky. In the nose there's almost no fruit at all, but in the mouth, once you cut through the layers of wood and butter, there's some melon, pear and vanilla. But wood overrides that, too. In the finish it's all oak-driven spice and resin. If this all sounds like a lumberjack's special, it is",20.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
20296,M. Trinchero 2000 Mary's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Made in the full-blown, barrel-fermented and -aged style, this wine shows off the cooper's art in its bold toasty-caramelly-vanilla aromas and flavors. Some peach fruit manages to sneak through the wooden stockade, providing a hint of balance.",19.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
20302,Pepi 2000 Pinot Grigio (Willamette Valley),"This wine is so dry, sharp, and tart, it's like lemon juice. Some will like it, while others more used to ripe, sweet fruit may find it sour. One thing is for sure, it could use some food. One of those wines that's great with shellfish.",12.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
20310,Grgich Hills 2000 Private Reserve Style Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"Hardly run of the mill, this offering is just too much like fruit juice and not enough like white wine. Basic lemon and grapefruit flavors are offset by some herbaceous grassiness, and the finish is tart, almost sour. The balance isn't really there.",18.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
21706,Turnbull 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Oakville),"Aromas of glue, bacon fat and earth make for a confounding bouquet that really doesn't welcome you in. The plump, creamy palate has some bright citrus, but mostly it's about underripe melon. The tart, short finish is clean, but not terribly convincing.",16.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
21968,Voss 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Grapefruit mixed with honey and some green veggies welcome you in, while the intriguing palate provides citrus, more honey, apricots and even some scallions. Simple and straightforward it's not; but it is fairly easy to drink. Served chilled on the front porch during the summer.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
21972,Duckhorn 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Muscular, mildly sweaty aromatics make this a little tough to get into, but the flavors are really elevated and complex. There's layered citrus, slate, licorice and spice all working together. The texture is nice, with spiciness coming on late. A bit of sweetness properly offsets the spicy, peppery quality to the finish.",21.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
21974,Abacela 2000 Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley),"Intense, fruity, soft and sensuous, this sweet and pretty wine features whole cluster fermentation. It is lively and balanced, fruity and smooth. Terrific for summer sipping.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
22851,Monticello Vineyards 2000 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years.",50.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
22868,Lemelson 2000 Tikka's Run Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a rich, barrel fermented style that delivers creamy, layered, textured flavors accented with flower, white pepper and mineral notes. A smack of butterscotch finishes it beautifully.",18.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
22871,Cuneo 2000 Two Rivers Red (Oregon),"Inky and dense, with plum-cake aromas along with nuances of tree bark and nutmeg. The more time you give this ripe, tannic red, the more it'll offer. The fruit is pure and ripe, and the tannins are anything but meek. On the finish, root beer, chocolate and vanilla notes add some complexity and sweetness. The fruit is 61% Columbia Valley (Wash.) and 39% southern Oregon, and the whole is a fine yet brawny offering.",18.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
26432,Vino Con Brio 2000 Pinotage (Lodi),"Puts out hot country scents of baked cherry pie, pie crust, and tar, and those hot notes continue in the mouth. There's something Port-like in the raisiny flavors and thick texture. Turns semi-sweet on the finish.",20.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
26435,Eola Hills 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Applegate Valley),"Aromas of jalapeno peppers, thistle and pine needles raise questions about ripeness while not exactly rolling out the welcome mat. That said, the wine is surprisingly sweet, with orange and lemon flavors. Finally, a thick texture runs in contrast to the lean nose, ultimately leaving one confused and asking: Is this really Sauvignon Blanc?",10.0,81,3,0.9573912533610714
27561,Oak Knoll 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A really nice wine, refreshing and light, with delicate lemon-grapefruit flavors complexed with creamy lees. The acidity is very crisp and assertive. No discernible oak at all, and with this pretty fruit and structure, it doesn't need any.",13.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
27566,Spottswoode 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The bouquet is a bit flat at first, offering nothing more than white stone fruits and pear. Green melon is amplified by a dose of white pepper on the palate, while the finish is layered and solid; it's the best part of the wine by far.",25.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
27571,Torii Mor 2000 Pinot Blanc (Rogue Valley),"This is a big-flavored wine, aged sur lie, and about 30% was barreled in new French oak. There are pleasant vanilla, lime andapricot flavors, a creamy mouthfeel and a toasty edge to the finish.",18.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
27572,Torii Mor 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"The treatment here is fermentation in stainless steel, and the wine shows ripe, tart, tangy fruit. Mostly melon and kiwi flavors, good weight on the palate, and little if any oak.",20.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
27581,Whitehall Lane 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A touch of the veggies, particularly asparagus and bell pepper, mix with citrus in this fuller-bodied white. While it isn't exactly a heavyweight, the ample body is weighed down by lower than average acidity. On the back end, the long, persistent finish is adequate, but the green element that's so present up front comes back in force.",15.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
29058,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2000 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Only eight barrels of this totally wonderful stuff were produced. This young, immature Syrah is massive and splendid. Huge in fruit, pepper, smoke, and earthy flavors, swaddled in rich tannins and smart oak. Great now, but will improve over the next 4 years.",75.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
29070,Darioush 2000 Shiraz (Napa Valley),"The wine starts of with intriguing bacon and earth tones that are followed up by rich, ripe raspberry, black cherry, spice, licorice, herb and toast flavors. It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end. Look for more of this varietal from Darioush as its Shiraz vineyards mature.",64.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
33038,Conn Creek 2000 Anthology Red (Napa Valley),"Absolutely delicious, a fat, sumptuous wine that flatters the palate from beginning to end. Smells plush, brimming with currants and fancy oak trimmings, and turns lush and complex with fruit in the mouth. Best to drink it soon, in the fullness of youth.",54.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
33051,Pessagno 2000 Hames Valley Vineyard Port (Monterey),"A lush, rich  Port with a smooth texture and flavors that range from black cherry, blackberry, cassis, cinnamon, anise, chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and thyme. It's complex yet delightfully easy to drink.",33.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
33856,DeLille 2000 Chaleur Estate White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice.",25.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
34003,Whitcraft 2000 French Camp Vineyard Lagrein (San Luis Obispo County),"Wins the darkest wine of the decade award. Absolutely black, except for a gleam of purple at the edge. Smells big, deep and oaky, with berry and chocolate scents. In the mouth, similar to Cabernet, with blackberry flavors and rich, thick tannins. Interesting as an alternative-type wine, and an ager. An ancient grape from the north of Italy and Austria",20.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
34016,Cana's Feast 2000 Del Rio Vineyard Red (Rogue Valley),"Southern Oregon, unlike the northern Willamette Valley, is warm and conducive to growing Bordeaux varieties, as evidenced by this hearty, tannic blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Right away you get kirsch and cassis from this heavyweight, and that's followed by a ripe palate that blasts loudly with plum and chocolate. Along the way there are some drying tannins and pulsating acids, so either lay it down for a couple of years or decant and serve with grilled meats.",30.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
34017,Crane Family 2000 Hilltop Selection Merlot (Napa Valley),"Terrific structure on this well made wine. You'll be impressed by the rich tannins and fine acids. Caresses the palate with gentle smoothness. But be forewarned, this wine is lean on fruit. It's herbal and earthy. But it shows that a Napa red doesn't have to be fruit bomb to be elegant and delicious.",52.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
37049,Thurston Wolfe 2000 Burgess Vineyard Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There isn't much Zin in Washington, but this makes a good case for more. Thick and tannic, it's a meaty, dark wine that includes 25% Petite Sirah. Seventeen months in new American oak has left an indelible whisky-barrel scent. —P.G.",20.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
37052,Pontin del Roza 2000 White Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Pontin scores with a sweet, lemony, ripe mouthful of fresh and fruity Riesling. Shows the verve and juicy deliciousness of Yakima Valley fruit.",8.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
37057,Morgan 2000 Cotes du Crow's Red (California),"A Grenache-Syrah-Petite Sirah blend from a warmer part of the county. Cool nights yield good acids, but the wine isn't fully ripened. You can taste green, stalky flavors alongside the red cherry ones. The mouthfeel is a bit rough. Still, it's not without interest. —S.H.",14.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
37060,McDowell 2000 Rose Grenache (California),"This Rhone blend drinks candied and off-dry, with ripe berry, fruit, and spice flavors, and on the soft side. Strives to combine the freshness and lightness of a white with the weight of a red, and does a pretty good job of it.",9.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
37065,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Winemaker's Series Syrah (Idaho),"The grapes come from the Chicken Dinner vineyard, which says it all. Pop this tart, tangy wine, with its Zin-like red berry flavors and hints of white pepper, and bring on the fried chicken. —P.G.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
37075,Spencer Roloson 2000 Viognier (Rutherford),"An interesting wine, grown in Cabernet country, that's as full-bodied as a red wine. The flavors are solidly Viognier, though, with exotic tropical fruits and wild flowers that drink almost off-dry. Plenty of oak and sur lie aging provide textural complexities.  —S.H.",19.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
38753,Thornton 2000 Viognier (South Coast),"Opens with earthy-honeyed scents, and turns tart, austere and grapefruity in the mouth, with bright acidity. If you're looking for a lush, exotic Viognier, this isn't it.  —S.H.",13.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
38761,Stonehedge 2000 Syrah (California),"Earthy, herbal aromas veer into cardboard, and a distinct waft of raw green peppercorn. The grapes didn't fully ripen. But the wine is dry, tart and clean and there's a certain food friendliness. Try it with stews or barbecue and you might discover hidden charms. —S.H.",10.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
38770,Forest Glen 2000 Pinot Grigio (California),"Fruity, clean, and on the sweet side, this is an everyday quaffer whose sugary flavors are just fine for a sunny afternoon with ripe peaches or apricots. ItÕs Cailfornia soft, a country style wine that will appeal to those who find some whites tart or sour.",10.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
38777,Kendall-Jackson 2000 Collage Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (California),"A new, Aussie-style line from K-J, a series of varietal blends. This wine is a little too stewed and overripe, with raisiny, pruny aromas and flavors. The finish is a bit jammy and treacly, but it's not a bad casual sipper. —S.H.",9.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
38781,Lava Cap 2000 Sémillon (El Dorado),"Kind of bizarre, because there are baked custard and sweetened espresso and honeyed spice aromas, and then it turns unnaturally sweet on the palate. It's also flat, with an odd, medicinal aftertaste. Most Sémillons don't have these particular features. —S.H.",18.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
39317,Tamarack Cellars 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A very well-made Merlot, with sweet fruit and attractive scents of vanilla and cracker. Though still showing a lot of youthful acidity, it wraps the fruit in a big blast of new oak and finishes with a hint of heat.",28.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
39318,McCrea 2000 La Mer White (Yakima Valley),"This is 58% Viognier and 42% Chardonnay, making a crisp, clean, dynamic white with plenty of lime and citrus flavor. Delicious and refreshing, it's a perfect food wine.",18.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
39321,Domaine Chandon 2000 Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"Dried spices, dusty earth and steely red fruit mesh well in this wine, which closes with enticing cherry and bitter chocolate notes. This wine is toasty, oh-so-smooth, and undeniably plush and seductive. Share this with someone special.",29.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
39322,Ca' del Solo 2000 Big House Red Red (California),"A blend of six varietals including Cabernet Franc and Syrah, this wine is utterly distinctive. The raspberry liqueur aroma has a meaty edge complemented with things like ground coffee, violets and white chocolate. All these flavors mingle in the mouth, and yet the wine is dry. The supple, silky texture is notable. Best Buy. —S.H.",10.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
39327,Chinook 2000 Sémillon (Yakima Valley),"This wine shows a lot of Bourbon-barrel oak flavor, underscoring fruit that has plenty of apple and melon intensity, enlightened with pleasing herbal accents.",14.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
39331,Woodward Canyon 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Flavorful, forward and tasting of a pleasing mix of light, toasty oak and pretty cherry fruit, this is a solid, immediately enjoyable wine. It doesn't have the muscle to go long term, but it offers a lot of pure Merlot pleasure in the near term. —P.G.",38.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
39334,Snoqualmie 2000 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a young wine and tastes like a Beaujolais. Spicy, grapey and showing an almost spritzy lightness; it has good, clean fruit with a lively, tangy, spicy mouthfeel. Best Buy. —P.G.",11.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
39336,Truchard 2000 AVA's: Carneros/Napa Valley Zinfandel (California),"A big wine bursting with the wildest of brambly berry flavors, and a peppery, herbal hint of earth and wood. The tannins are smooth and dusty. It's a nice bit of winemaking, but a little too big and uncontrolled for its britches. —S.H.",28.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
39345,Alapay 2000 Viognier (Santa Barbara County),"Typically bright and floral-fruity, this offers up a big mouthful of lemonade, peach juice, and honeyed, wildlfower flavors. ItÕs creamy and rich, and really a lot of fun, a wine to enjoy, not ponder over.",19.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
40857,Hawk Crest 2000 Merlot (California),"Rough and awkward, with some cherry flavors and greener ones of stems and herbs. Drinks dry and fairly tannic. Perfectly acceptable as an inexpensive chugger.",14.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
40861,Casa de Caballos 2000 Ultra Violet Merlot (Paso Robles),"Tastes hot and strong, a heavy wine with earthy, tobacco flavors softened with a hint of briary berry. Totally dry, with an astringent finish.",24.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
41774,Robert Mondavi 2000 Unfiltered Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"Very funky and confounding at first, but then it opens to reveal smoke, stone fruit and mineral aromas. The mouth is quite spicy, with green herbs accenting citrus and mineral. The tangy lemon finish has a chalky grip to it, which only adds to the overall complexity of this unique Napa white.",19.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
41780,Bernardus 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),"Passion fruit, citrus and other nice aromatics make for a pretty nose, which is followed by genuinely good and correct flavors such as grapefruit, lemon and citrus rind. The finish is also quite nice, with a certain roundness and acidity that makes it tantalizing and tasty.",15.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
41785,Foley 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara),"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through.",17.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
41793,Robert Mondavi 2000 SLD Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off.",23.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
41800,Voss 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Grapefruit mixed with honey and some green veggies welcome you in, while the intriguing palate provides citrus, more honey, apricots and even some scallions. Simple and straightforward it's not; but it is fairly easy to drink. Served chilled on the front porch during the summer.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
41824,Spencer Roloson 2000 Viognier (Rutherford),"An interesting wine, grown in Cabernet country, that's as full-bodied as a red wine. The flavors are solidly Viognier, though, with exotic tropical fruits and wild flowers that drink almost off-dry. Plenty of oak and sur lie aging provide textural complexities.  —S.H.",19.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41825,Arbor Crest 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sauvignon Blanc has long been the winery's calling card, but this vintage isn't quite up to past standards. Some high-toned scents add edginess to the tropical fruit, and some bitter skin flavors are borderline too much. Good, but they can do better.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41828,Columbia Winery 2000 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),"Pinot Gris is starting to have a presence in Washington, and the straightforward, citrus-flavored fruit shown here suggests a middle-of-the-road style. It's a tart, palate-cleaning wine with a hint of citrus-rind bitterness in the finish.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41830,Handley 2000 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Comes down firmly on the  herbal side, opening with a blast of lemon and dill, but interventions, including barrel fermentation, soften and fatten it and add notes of butter and vanilla. In the mouth the lemony flavors return, with some residual sugar. The finish is a duet of acidity and sweetness. —S.H.",15.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41832,Covey Run 2000 Semillon-Chardonnay (Washington),"A dry style, tightly wound with hints of herb and spice. Simple, crisply rendered, and very fresh, with citrus-flavored fruit.",7.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41845,Seven Lions Winery 2000 Poor Man's Flat Vineyards 100 Year Old  Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Smells superripe and overly extracted, with jammy, fruit-tart aromas underscored by earthy, herbal notes of tobacco and sage. It's a big wine, and a little awkward, but it might knit together in the cellar. —S.H.",30.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
41846,Thornton 2000 Rose Grenache (Cucamonga Valley),"Pretty dark for a blush, and very strongly flavored. The raspberry flavors veer into framboise, it's that extracted and liqueur-like. So there's nothing shy about it. Unusual and eccentric, but a pretty, flavorful wine. —S.H.",14.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
43957,Kendall-Jackson 2000 Vintner's Reserve Merlot (California),"A pleasant sipper with some real depth and varietal character. The plummy, blackberry flavors have a nice streak of mocha and dried herbs, and are wrapped in fine, easy tannins. Feels good and clean through the spicy finish.",16.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
43963,Ravenswood 2000 Vintners Blend Merlot (California),"A good buy in a dry, full-bodied red wine. Clean and balanced, with jammy flavors of plums, earth and blackberry, it has well-etched and accessible tannins, a rich mouthfeel, and a spicy finish. Value.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
43964,Crane Family 2000 Don Raffaele Estate Merlot (Napa Valley),"A very strong wine of superior tannic and acid structure. You can feel the pedigree in your mouth, smooth, elegant and luscious. The fruit is as ripe as it might be. The flavors are earthy and tobaccoey, and the wine turns astringent on the finish.",39.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
43993,Acorn 2000 Alegria Vineyards Sangiovese (Russian River Valley),"A single-vineyard Sangiovese made Chianti-style, meaning it's dry as dust with pronounced acidity. Pretty rich in flavor, though, with a ripe streak of cherries and sweet chocolate. Dry, dusty tannins kick in in the finish.",16.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
43995,Lockwood 2000 Estate Grown & Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"This is tasty stuff, not only because it has the prettiest lemon and lime tastes, but the crisp acidity makes it lively on the palate. It's dryish, with a honeyed, ripe sweetness that lasts long into the finish.",11.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
45487,Weisinger's of Ashland 2000 Petite Pompadour Red (Rogue Valley),"This Bordeaux blend features charred, barrel-driven aromas along with leather and black-fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and acidic, with plum and raspberry flavors poking through a heavy coating of concrete tannins. The finish is equally tight and grippy, and here the tannins are even more pronounced. Very tight and hard; time in the cellar could be the prescription.",27.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
45488,Firestone 2000 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Smells good and rich, with waves of plum, blackberry, tar and smoke aromas, and the flavors are very similar. Drinks dry and tasty in the mouth, but loses a few points for a gritty tartness through the finish.",18.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
45500,Bell 2000 Merlot (Yountville),"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah.",30.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
45504,Geyser Peak 2000 Merlot (Sonoma County),"A bit lean in fruit, in keeping with this problem vintage. Aromas of damp earth, cigar and thyme have just a hint of blackberry. The tannins are very finely ground, and soft acidity makes for a pleasant mouthfeel, but it's thin stuff.",17.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
45505,ForestVille 2000 Sonoma Reserve Merlot (Alexander Valley),"A Julia Roberts of a Merlot, pretty and innocent, maybe a little clueless. But who cares? It's fruity, dry, and fun, and even has some layers of complexity. Best of all, it doesn't cost too much. Drink up!",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
45953,Chacewater 2000 15 Year Old Tawny Dessert Wine Red (Lake County),"A delicious, beautifully aged tawny-style dessert wine, this rarity is sweet and fortified with alcohol, and also superbly well balanced.

Supportive tannins and acidity keep the texture lively and the finish lingering.",75.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
54055,Sebastiani 2000 Cohen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Aromas of fresh green straw and citrus set the stage for a mouth full of grass and citrus, which may sound strange, but it's what we found. The finish is tangy and hard-edged, but a touch of sweetness saves it from a worse fate and actually brings the wine to a good finish. About 40% of the cuvée was barrel fermented, which gives it a softer feel than it might otherwise have.",18.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
55897,Terre Rouge 2000 Les Côtes de L'Ouest Syrah (California),"Dark and sexy; there's something erotic about this wine, with its seductive jammy flavors, velvety texture and spicy, long finish. After an initial bite of acidity, it turns soft as a goose-down pillow. In its own way, it's perfect. And the price is unreal. Best Buy.",15.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
56213,Talomas 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (California),"This is the latest Mondavi partnership -- are you keeping track? -- this time, with Australia's Rosemount Estate. It is a young, jammy wine, like an Aussie Shiraz, with uncomplicated but ripe and tasty berry flavors and rich, thick tannins. Easy drinking in a big, full-bodied wine.",14.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
57365,M. Cosentino 2000 The Novelist Meritage Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Oak from barrels stars front and center, overshadowing the citrus, melon and fig flavors underneath. Feels great in the mouth, creamy and lush. By summer 2003, it will be better. A blend of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Sémillon.",16.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
57732,Mendelson 2000 Pinot Gris (Napa Valley),"Very sweet and rich in honeyed citrus and vanilla flavors, this dessert wine suggests white cookies and cakes as partners. It's not particularly complex, but it is deliciously easy to drink.",33.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
57756,Darioush 2000 Shiraz (Napa Valley),"The wine starts of with intriguing bacon and earth tones that are followed up by rich, ripe raspberry, black cherry, spice, licorice, herb and toast flavors. It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end.

57764,Alban 2000 Estate Vineyard Roussanne (Edna Valley),"Clearly a winner, a wine that shows its terroir in the mineral, slate, vanilla and cotton candy aromas. The flavor is hard to describe, sort of a mix of tapioca, rasberry puree and gunflint. Very acidic and crisp, with a long, firm and steely finish that cries out for rich, complex foods.",32.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
58394,Buty 2000 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This new Walla Walla winery premieres with a toasty, soft, barrel- fermented Bordeaux blanc blend that's 70% Sém, 30% Sauv Blanc. The fruit is ripe and packed with rich flavors, without being too fat and tropical. Its lightly herbal, grassy nuances combine with plenty of well-managed, pleasantly spicy, toasty oak.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58395,Hagafen 2000 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Fairly dense and viscous. The wine serves up smoky, black cherry, toast, herb and chocolate flavors couched in supple tannins. Moderate on the finish. —J.M.",27.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58399,Deerfield Ranch 2000 Peterson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"Kicks the palate with a roundhouse of grass, hay, gooseberry and lime, softened by wood and a hint of lees. This is a distinctive white wine. It shares the crisp, herbal nature of Sauvignon Blanc and adds enough interesting notes to make it complex and stylish. —S.H.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58402,Kestrel 2000 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Forward and fruity, this medium-bodied wine shows good balance and varietal spice—white pepper and roasted coffee—along with delicious cherry/berry fruit. —P.G.",28.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58404,M. Cosentino 2000 Vin Doux Viognier Kay Viognier (California),"Mitch Cosentino used stainless steel fermentation to preserve the brilliant peach nectar fruit of this vin doux (sweet wine), then aged it in French oak to add a creamy mouthfeel. It's sweet and rich and delicious and shows another face of Viognier. —S.H.",30.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58406,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Winemaker's Series Merlot (Idaho),"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G.",10.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58407,McCrea 2000 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"The fruit comes primarily from Ciel du Cheval and Boushey vineyards, and delivers intense, spicy cherry and pungent grape scents and flavors. There are hints of tobacco and wild fruits, too, and the forward style favors early drinking. —P.G.",35.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58408,Three Rivers 2000 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is light, with fresh berry flavors. It's pretty, forward, fruity and bright; perfect for light grilled foods. —P.G.",32.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58414,Russell Creek 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has sharp, cedary oak dominating the fruit right now. The fruit is good, solid black cherry, but it is not quite big enough to tackle all that new oak, though some bottle time will help. Good, ambitious winemaking. —P.G.",32.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
58418,L'Ecole No. 41 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Big, friendly and wrapped in a lot of chocolatey oak. The fruit is forward and light, and it is just big enough to hang in there with all the barrel flavors. —P.G.",29.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
59374,Guenoc 2000 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),"Interestingly, there are dried fruits and flowers with a touch of petrol on the bouquet. This wine sits really nicely in the mouth, offering a plethora of lemon-lime, melon and pear flavors. It's rich and ripe, bordering on the heavy side. But it manages to toe that all-important line of balance, and therefore it qualifies as a winner.",15.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
59394,Paschal 2000 Pinot Blanc (Rogue Valley),"Scents of hay and alfalfa open into an elegant, stylish wine with lovely textures. It is lightly citric, with pretty nuances of grass, hints of honey and tea. The winemaker has a gentle, delicate touch with all his wines, but this is the best of the best. Just 100 cases were produced.",16.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
61171,Domaine Danica 2000 Salzgeber Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"It's all a matter of taste, but to me this wine is too hot, at 15% alcohol, and too sweet. The earthy, berry flavors are rich, and the tannin structure is complex, but it's out of balance.",32.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
61763,Buttonwood Farm 2000 Devin Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Heavier and denser in every respect than the regular Sauvignon Blanc, this wine, a 60-40 blend with Sémillon, is also strongly leesy. The citrus flavors hit the palate with a strong dose of rich sour cream notes. The wine is dry and practically cries out for garlicky dishes.",16.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
65918,Switchback Ridge 2000 Peterson Family Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A thick, dark Merlot, cloaked in smooth, fat tannins and redolent of cherry, licorice, blackberry, plum, spice, coffee, sage, thyme and hints of orange peel. Long and sleek, with toasty oak on the finish. Just a hint of tartness at the end, but still a terrific wine.",48.0,92,3,0.9573912533610714
65923,Pride Mountain 2000 Vintner's Select Wind Whistle Vineyard Merlot (Napa County),"A success despite a certain leanness, a young wine in need of mid-term cellaring. Notes of of green olives, bacon, unsweetened dark chocolate, and boysenberries are wrapped in sumptuous, lush tannins that melt on the palate. This bone dry wine needs rich meats.",65.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
65925,Barlow 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Textbook Napa Merlot. Flavors of green olives, blackberries,white chocolate and herbs, with a slight meatiness, are wrapped in delicate, fine tannins. The wine is very dry and feels great in the mouth. Has the stuffing to improve in the cellar for a few years.",28.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
65926,The Eyrie Vineyards 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Eyrie is back in stride with this benchmark pinot gris after a sub-par '99 bottling. Fresh flavors of lemon zest and pear highlight a subtle wine whose subtle spice and zesty complexity promise a long,  pleasing life ahead.",15.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
66692,Rancho Zabaco 2000 Chiotti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"At the top of the Rancho Zabaco hierarchy are the Zinfandels from the company's Chiotti and Stefani vineyards. Unfortunately there will be no Stefani in 2000, but the Chiotti is very good. It's very young, and takes a bit of coaxing to tease out aromas of toast, dried spices and blackberries before flowing smoothly across the palate in a wave of briary fruit. Finishes with firm acidity and a bit of black pepper. Drink now.",25.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
66697,Matanzas Creek 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"From the get-go it's a big, full grapefruit-driven wine that's laced with smoke and vanilla. Citrus, mostly lemon, is the taste profile, while good lively acids power the tight, lemony finish. Serve chilled alongside a platter of tasty appetizers.",22.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
67871,Babcock 2000 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This dark, young wine is brooding. It's hiding itself in a purple velvet cloak, revealing only hints of spicy blackberry fruit and smoked meat. The tannins are chewy, but yielding, like gum. It's a very beautiful wine that will improve for a couple years in the cellar.",23.0,90,3,0.9573912533610714
69515,Burgess 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Has the luscious tannins and beautiful acids you expect from Napa, and some rich plummy, berry flavors. Also possesses a depth and weight that are appropriate for the price. There's a bit of roughness, though, that detracts.",25.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
69538,DeLorimier 2000 Malbec (Alexander Valley),"A dark, young wine, rich in sharp acids and fresh youthful fruit, with deep flavors of dark stone tree fruits and berries, such as plums and loganberries. It's very dry, and the tannins, while vigorous, are negotiable. Will mellow with a few years of bottle age.",20.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
70652,Dry Creek Vineyard 2000 Soleil--Limited Edition Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Peachy Canyon NV Mustang Springs Ranch Port (Paso Robles); $40. What you need in a Port-style wine is sugary, caramelized sweetness, the deep, strong taste of fruit, high alcohol and crisp acidity. This wine has them all. But   it lacks that extra depth and complexity that a   Port wants, especially at this price. Still, a solid effort. —S.H.",20.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
70654,Sagelands 2000 Four Corners Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A round, solidly made wine, with Bing cherry flavors. However, the middle seems to disappear and, as a result, the following tannins feel a bit harsh. —P.G.",15.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
70655,Thornton 2000 Miramonte Vineyards Pinot Blanc (South Coast),"It's very dry and tart. Strong flavors of lemon juice are accompanied by biting acids and even some dusty tannins, but it's a clean, zesty drink. —S.H.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
70661,Andretti 2000 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"This is a full-bodied wine with very strong fruit, including some dark berry notes more akin to a big red like, say, Merlot—of which it contains a dash. At the same time, the tannins are light, which makes it kind of schizoid. It's also superacidic and tart. Made by respected Napa vintner Bob Pepi, it's a work in progress. —S.H.",19.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
70662,Pontin del Roza 2000 Pinot Grigio (Yakima Valley),"The aromas are clean and varietal, and the fruit follows along with pleasant, light pear and apple flavors, buoyed by tangy acids.",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
70665,Trinchero 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A grassy style, with hints of fig and melon around the edges. Bright and lemony on the finish. —J.M.",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
72880,Peju 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Pricey for the variety, especially considering the quality, which is not high. Smells and tastes vegetal, with traces of asparagus, oregano and mint, and a weird sweetness on the finish. —S.H.",22.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
74394,Cinnabar 2000 Mercury Rising Red (California),"A tasty, easy-drinking Bordeaux blend assembled from three very different regions, the Santa Cruz Mountains, Sierra Foothills and Lodi. Very flavorful, almost exotic with cassis, cherry, chocolate, and ripe breadfruit and guava, framed in quite a bit of smoky oak. The tannins are soft. This is a wine that everyone will like.",17.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
74395,Griffin Creek 2000 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),"The clear scent of root beet along with barrel char works, and so does the ripe palate that's full of red raspberry and chocolate. If none of that sounds like Cab Franc from the Loire Valley or elsewhere, it's not. In it's own right, this is a ripe, full-bodied wine that's oaky, tannic and big—but also quite clean. And the texture is pure new wave.",28.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
74401,Abacela 2000 Merlot (Umpqua Valley),"Actually a Bordeaux blend, this mainly merlot wine from the Umpqua valley in central Oregon outdoes its peers with dark, plummy, even jammy fruit laced with toast, tar and espresso. Sweet fruit meets stiff tannins, all in the name of structure.",18.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
74402,Clos du Val 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Made in a restrained, elegant style, with modulated blackberry, currant and herb flavors balanced with oak. Dry, supple and polished, this young wine needs a year or two in the cellar to gain complexity.",25.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
74751,Gloria Ferrer 2000 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"The winery held back this brut-style wine for eleven years. Even at this great age, the wine tastes young and vibrant in acidity, with rich strawberry, orange, lime and yeast flavors, finished with sweet vanilla. Tastes beautiful now, but extraordinary as it is, it should gain traction over the next ten years.",50.0,95,3,0.9573912533610714
77511,Emmolo 2000 Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one.",16.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
77518,Wooldridge Creek 2000 Viognier (Rogue Valley),"This is made in a very rich style, with lots of forward fruit, flavors of pears, citrus and citrus rind. Somehow the floral elegance of the variety is lost in all the ripe fruit.",16.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
77521,Bridgeview 2000 Merlot (Oregon),"The grapes come from the Applegate valley and the blend is 100% Merlot. The flavors are not particularly varietal; they are broader and more rustic, reminiscent of Carmenère. The palate impression is of soft, sweet, light blueberry fruit, for immediate drinking.",10.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
77523,The Academy 2000 Merlot (Applegate Valley),"The color is substantial, and the wine has some spicy tartness. Moderately ripe red fruits, firm acids and balanced tannins tell the story.",20.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
77525,Rancho Zabaco 2000 Sonoma Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"The Sonoma County blend is warm and spicy, mixing a trace of alcoholic heat with black pepper. Mixed berries, dried fruits and a hint of raisins are all underscored by milk chocolate. Finishes tart, cranberryish and oaky.",16.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
77813,St. Supéry 2000 White Meritage (Napa Valley),"This Bordeaux blend is partially barrel fermented and aged in one-year-old oak, which explains why this blend of 56% Sémillon and 44% Sauvignon Blanc has both an oakiness and a steeliness over its pear and citrus fruit. Mouthfeel is subtly creamy; closes with banana and pear.",22.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
77818,M. Cosentino 2000 The Zin Zinfandel (Lodi),"Classic late-harvest Zin that packs a real whallop. Wld berries and stone fruits mingle with pruny, raisiny notes in this softly textured, rather alcoholic wine. They couldn't or didn't ferment to dryness, so there's some sugar in the middle palate and finish, where those raisiny flavors reappear.",30.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
80195,Pontin del Roza 2000 Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"The style can only be called “nouveau” as the soft, forward, very grapey aromas are followed by tart, lightly spicy cranberry fruit and a quick, light finish. —P.G.",23.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
80199,Coastal Ridge 2000 Shiraz (California),"A good wine. It's nicely dry, with crisp acids and adequate tannins. There's a pretty good balance between plum and berry flavors and earthy, herbal ones. It's rough around the edges, with a burnt-rubber quality, but okay drinking for everyday occasions. —S.H.",7.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
80200,Bargetto 2000 Pinot Grigio (California),"Smells fresh and lemony, with accents of smoke and butter. You also get sweetish lemon flavors, with a real attack of acidity. The wine is a little spritzy, which isnÕt all that bad, although it may be better as an aperitif than a food wine.",16.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
80210,Amador Foothill Winery 2000 Hollander Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Captures Syrah's wild and woolly side, with jammy, wild berry flavors that taste fresh from the fermenter. The acidity is sharp, almost green, and there are stemmy, chlorophyll notes. From 3-year- old vines. Shows promise, but the vines need age, and the wine needs tweaking. —S.H.",20.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
80211,Stonehedge 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Here's a simple little wine that makes for pleasant drinking at an affordable price. It's lemony and dry and soft in acids, but it is very clean and is fine for fried chicken, fruit salad and other picnic-type fare. —S.H.",10.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
82466,Edgewood 2000 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Awkward, overripe and too sweet, a textbook wine that falls prey to Zin's traditional pitfalls. There are ripe berry flavors but they are out of balance with everything else. A syrupy, cough-mediciney texture frames it all.",20.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
82469,Catacula 2000 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Marred by the faults that can and do plague Zin. Uneven ripening resulted in green, stalky aromas and flavors that are lean and tannic on the finish. Meanwhile, a cloying residue of sweetness marks the middle palate. Unbalanced and awkward.",15.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
82480,Shenandoah 2000 Rezerve Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"A wine that tastes like cheap Port. Smells caramelly and tastes overtly sweet, with berry flavors framed in tough, rugged tannins. Could be any red varietal under the sun.",24.0,82,3,0.9573912533610714
82492,Sogno 2000 Syrah (El Dorado),"Just barely acceptable as a table wine due to the unnatural cherry cough syrup flavors and insipid mouthfeel. They vinified it dry, but it still feels insipid, with very flat acidity.",15.0,81,3,0.9573912533610714
85988,Château Souverain 2000 Merlot (Alexander Valley),"From a longtime value producer, an immensely rich wine with significantly ripe, big fruit. Has layers of flavors ranging from blackberries and plums to chocolate, and is very dry. But the tannins are great, plush and thick and easy. Might benefit from a year or so in the bottle.",18.0,89,3,0.9573912533610714
91533,M. Cosentino 2000 Cigar Zin Zinfandel (Lodi),"Here's a Port-like Zin to sip late at night as the snow falls and the chestnuts are roasting. Plum pudding, raisin, and dark-chocolate flavors, with slight residual sugar and enough acidity to make it bright and balanced.",27.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
91537,Stonehedge 2000 Zinfandel (California),"Pretty nice for a statewide appellation, with true Zin characteristics of wild, brambly berries. The alcohol is high and the wine is very dry, a full-throttle assault on the senses, with its maximum load of jammy fruit. Nothing subtle, just a bases-loaded, ripe wine that leaves little to the imagination. Best Buy.",10.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
92151,Hermann J. Wiemer 1997 Cuvée Brut 2000  (Finger Lakes),"Overtly sweet aromas and flavors dominate this upstate New York offering. Wiemer’s wines have impressed us before, but this comes off as heavy-handed, with a dense, perfumey quality. It possesses decent length and texture, but the weighty sweetness makes it a better candidate for mimosas or for entertaining those who shy away from dryness.",23.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
93916,Pontin del Roza 2000 Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"A nice bottle of wine, bone-dry and fragrant, with pleasing, simple flavors.",7.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
93921,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Value Series Merlot (Idaho),"Idaho and Merlot are not thoughts that generally spring together in the mind of the wine consumer, but Ste. Chapelle makes a good run at crafting an attractive, perfectly balanced wine here. The fruit is cherry and lightly herbal, and there are interesting flavors of earth and mocha, too. Best Buy. —P.G.",7.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
93927,Covey Run 2000 Lemberger (Yakima Valley),"A popular favorite in the Northwest, Lemberger is a rustic, grapey, Zin-wannabe that offers pleasingly soft, fruity flavors well-suited to summer. This contains 24% Merlot, which adds weight to the fruit. Its soft tannins and light chocolate flavors make this a great go-to wine for the backyard barbecue. Best Buy. —P.G.",7.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
93932,Andretti 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Here's a complex wine with bold flavors of lemongrass and peaches that are rich and honeyed, and yet it's tart and crisp enough to be your dry white wine of the evening. Combines the best of both worlds: round, sweet fruit and dry acidity that makes your mouth water, even as it's savoring the flavor. —S.H.",14.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
93938,Sapphire Hill 2000 Winberrie Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"An herbal, not to say earthy, wine with sage and oregano aromas and flavors. Dry and supple, it's softened by a hint of cherry cola in the finish, and will wake up with rich barbecue. —S.H.",30.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
93941,Kiona 2000 Dry White Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scents of lemon wax and a slightly spritzy mouthfeel are followed by somewhat surprisingly sweet fruit for a wine labeled dry. The flavors favor orange juice and orange candy. If you like a fairly heavy, fruit-forward style, this is just right.",8.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
95412,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection White Burgundy White (California),"Explosively fruity, with big, bold flavors of peaches, pears, apples, tropical fruits, you name it. Drinks firmly dry, although oak brings a wood-sap sweetness. Lees aging was significant and adds a sour cream note. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc.",25.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
95668,Paumanok 2000 Semi Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),"Starts off with aromas of apple blossoms and ultraripe pears. The pear notes carry through on the palate, where they're joined by a touch of anise. This slightly sweet bottling pales in comparison to Paumanok's Dry Riesling, but offers a well-made, soft alternative.",15.0,83,3,0.9573912533610714
95745,Chacewater 2000 15 Year Old Tawny Dessert Wine Red (Lake County),"A delicious, beautifully aged tawny-style dessert wine, this rarity is sweet and fortified with alcohol, and also superbly well balanced. A diverse palette of flavors includes toffee, coffee, sweet prune, toasted almonds and chocolate. Supportive tannins and acidity keep the texture lively and the finish lingering.",75.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
97638,Ledson 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Soft, almost mute apple and pear aromas are accented by bell pepper and some lima beans. It's a typical bouquet for Napa SB, which is followed by the flavors of white grapefruit, a little citrus pith and some vanilla. Throughout there's a hint of spicy green veggies, mostly bell pepper and jalapeños. Overall, it offers good balance, just not enough fruit to override the green character.",18.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
97644,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2000 Rancho Chimiles Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Starts off with mineral, lemon and anise aromas that develop on the palate into dried spices, ground flint and lime. It's light in body, yet finishes strong, with clean citrus flavors and a lasting sensation of powdery talc.",28.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
97650,Bergström 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"If you're not sure what Pinot Gris/Grigio is like and want a good starter version, try this one. It's sweet like applesauce but dry like lemons, a seemingly impossible feat until you taste it. Plus, it's creamy from barrel fermentation, so it feels lush.",16.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
97657,Paschal 2000 Merlot (Applegate Valley),"This is a firm wine, with up-front flavors of plum and berry, enhanced with finishing licks of vanilla and white chocolate. A bit of Cabernet Sauvignon (8%) adds punch.",25.0,87,3,0.9573912533610714
97941,Coulson Eldorado 2000 Kipp Vineyard Mataro (El Dorado),"Soft and jammy, with black and red wild berry flavors and low acidity. ItÕs so soft and sweetly fruity itÕs almost like raspberry syrup, although it does have some structure and heat from alcohol. Fans of sweet wines will like it a lot.",15.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97945,Hunt Cellars 2000 Outlaw Ridge Zinphony #1 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"The brawniest of Hunt's releases, it borders on Port-like, with 14.7% alcohol and a burst of plummy, raisiny fruit. Other notes include char, smoke and a caramelized, pie-crust scent. Drinks big, slightly sweet, hot and peppery.  —S.H.",30.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97946,Firefall 2000 Lone Meadow Vineyard Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Fair Play),"From a newish appellation in El Dorado County, this is a copper-colored wine with richly sweet strawberry flavors and a peppery streak that lasts into the finish. It's dry enough for the dinner table. Try with cioppino. —S.H.",10.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97955,Canyon Road 2000 Shiraz (California),"They call it Shiraz instead of Syrah because it fits the stereotype of a young, jammy Aussie red. It's ferociously youthful, with blueberry and black cherry flavors that taste like they're fresh from the fermenting vats. A wine like this is sharp and edgy. But it's dry, and has a lot to like. —S.H.",10.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97960,Patrick M. Paul 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This tiny winery makes just a few hundred cases per year. The Merlot is grapey and rustic, with Grenache-like fruit flavors and some rough, chocolatey oak. —P.G.",28.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97962,Covey Run 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Washington),"This blend consists of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Merlot and the rest Cab Franc. Spicy and peppery, it has the telltale bell pepper scents of not-quite ripeness. But good value nonetheless, and structured for hearty foods. —P.G.",9.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97964,Royal Oaks 2000 Syrah (Central Coast),"Clean aromas of cola, meat and wild berries are simple, and so is the wine in the mouth. Big fruit, spicy and sugary ripe, is wrapped in soft acids and tannins and a round, silky texture. Doesn't really drink like a California Syrah; more like a jammy, early drinking Aussie Shiraz. —S.H.",20.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
97967,Ventana 2000 Dry Chenin Blanc (Monterey),"Drinks dry and bitter, with lemony, citrus flavors and an almond-skin tart finish. This is an austere, steely wine of integrity and fine structure. It's a nice palate cleanser, and stimulates the appetite. —S.H.",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
99584,Forest Glen 2000 Merlot (California),"Decent, with ripe flavors of cherries and spice, dry tannins and good acidity. Yes, it's a common wine, made for everyday consumption, but you can't drink expensive stuff every day. This will do in a pinch, or for your next block party.",10.0,84,3,0.9573912533610714
99775,Château Frank 2000 Blanc de Noirs  (Finger Lakes),"The charming nose of freshly picked berries promises good things to come. Off-dry, but not cloying, the palate is approachable and flirty, with fresh fruit flavors and a crisp finish. Not terribly complex, but overall a good go-to sparkling wine.",30.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
101695,J Vineyards & Winery 2000 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"A great California bubbly, right up at the top. It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit. The wine has some bottle age, and is softly picking up nutty, dried fruit, floral and yeasty notes. Enormously complex, it should continue to develop for many years.",50.0,95,3,0.9573912533610714
101702,Schramsberg 2000 J. Schram Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"Has a pretty copper-partridge color and is very dry, with crisp, mouthwatering acidity and a yeasty, leesy tartness. Flavorwise, this bubbly is about subtle raspberries, cherry skin, tangerine, brioche and vanilla. Feels a bit full-bodied and juvenile now. The suggestion is ageability. Try after 2012, if you can properly cellar.",130.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
102197,Brophy Clark 2000 Valley View Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A rich, 100% varietal in which warm sunshine coaxed out ripe  notes of figs and white peach, while the region's cool temperatures capture Sauvignon's minty, anise-infused side. The resulting wine is complex and dynamic. High acidity gives this very dry wine a nice bite of tartness.",14.0,88,3,0.9573912533610714
111415,Acorn 2000 Heritage Vines Alegria Vineyards Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Actually a blend of Zin plus 10 other minor varietals in an old field blend, this complex wine fascinates with its intricately interlocked flavors. There's a sensation a second. Bottom line: This wine is delicious, ripely sweet although technically dry, and ageworthy.",28.0,91,3,0.9573912533610714
111868,Catacula 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),A straightforward wine that goes the extra mile to achieve richness and finesse. The citrusy flavors are expressive and intense. One of the best Sauvignon Blanc values you'll find.,11.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
112732,Montinore 2000 Müller-Thurgau (Willamette Valley),"Cheese, milkweed and straw make for an unattractive nose, while the mouth is overtly sweet as if made from dried and candied mango and pineapple. The finish fades fast while leaving behind a residue left that isn't that pleasant.",7.0,80,3,0.9573912533610714
114563,J.J. Mchale 2000 Dorn Vineyard Fumé Blanc (Clear Lake),"Hailing from an emerging region northeast of Napa Valley, this SB is heavily oaked, and thus features big batches of butter and toast. Yellow apples and cantaloupe flavors are barely detectable under the veneer of thick oak. It's surely full-bodied, bordering on over the top. But it has positive qualities, including a rich and pleasant mouthfeel.",18.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114564,Dry Creek Vineyard 2000 Limited Edition DCVIII Fumé Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palate—mostly green beans and some pickle. Fortunately, there is also a light tropical fruit background to the flavor profile, something reminiscent of papaya. Ultimately, however, this wine is characterized more by its vegetal character than bright, clean fruit.",18.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114565,Monte Lago 2000 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Clear Lake),"There's a hint of saline or wet dog in the nose, and that keeps the wine from really taking off from the runway. Beyond that, citrus mixes with creamy notes to make up the mouth, and then it ends in a lemony, lush way. It's not a very complex wine, but it has enough zip to keep it going.",20.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114572,Paschal 2000 Quartet Red Wine Red (Applegate Valley),"This is assembled from ten different vineyards, and is the winery's flagship wine. It's a blend of 44% Cabernet Franc, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 9% Malbec. This wine has a good focus to the mid-palate, a decent amount of sweet cassis fruit, and a soft and lingering, though tannic, finish.",25.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114574,Selene 2000 Hyde Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"From this well-known Carneros vineyard comes this lighter lemon-lime SB with mixed citrus flavors and intense acidity. It's a medium-weight wine with a rather short pineapple finish. It has some creaminess to the mouthfeel, but overall it just doesn't ring the right bells to rate higher. Made by Mia Klein of Etude fame.",29.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114575,Siskiyou Vineyards 2000 La Cave Rouge Red (Oregon),"From a very warm site in pear country comes this Cabernet/Merlot blend. It shows ripe fruit, dense tannin, and some dark, toasted-coffee notes. The forward fruit is appealing, but the wine falls off in the middle and finishes quickly.",15.0,86,3,0.9573912533610714
114581,Liparita 2000 Oakville Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A strong vegetal character mars the nose of this otherwise dry, spicy Napa Valley SB. There is a boatload of asparagus and green pepper to the nose, and in the mouth the fruit element, meaning papaya and mild citrus, gets gobbled up by a potent blast of green flavors. The finish is spicy and dry, but it's also heavy with the taste of green peas. Was ripeness a problem here? Seems like it was",18.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
114583,Chimney Rock 2000 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"Strange aromas of chewing gum, silly putty, green beans and turnip make for an unconventional bouquet. The palate is rather vegetal and dilute, with hints of sweet gum and pepper. The finish is light and simple, with just a smidgen of grapefruit. While hard to peg, there's an off quality to this wine that holds it back.",18.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
114587,Girardet 2000 Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),"Crisp and clean, stainless steel-fermented, yet showing a lot of tropical fruit in the nose, and a touch (half a percent) of residual sugar. Banana, mango and citrus flavors are there, along with plenty of acidity. Interesting, but not particularly varietal.",12.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
114588,Benziger 2000 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Strikes a middle-of-the-road pose, combining a nice apple and watermelon fruitiness with a little softness, a little sweetness and enough acidity to make it balanced. It's an easy wine to like and to pair with casual foods.",20.0,85,3,0.9573912533610714
115103,Schramsberg 2000 Reserve 50 Late Disgorged  (North Coast),"The deep-gold color shows how long this wine has been aging. Smoky, toasted baguette aromas lead to very rich flavors that taste almost sweet but are appetizingly dry. The fruit notes go from ripe white cherry at the base to vivid lemon and kiwi for top notes. A lavish, long finish echoes butter and apple butter flavors.",175.0,94,3,0.9573912533610714
115876,Iron Horse 2000 Brut LD Sparkling (Green Valley),"A mere 40 cases of this LD exists, a lucky find in the cellar laid down in 2001 and forgotten about until this year. A blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it's fragrant in dried fruit and boasts a thick, unctuous mouthfeel. Briny, dry and tart, with the taste of fresh-squeezed lemon, it's a philosophical exercise in the art of patience.",110.0,93,3,0.9573912533610714
209,Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",14.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
211,Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",16.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
232,Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel (Amador County),"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.",35.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
298,Clos La Chance 2006 Lila's Cuvée Red (Central Coast),"This Rhône-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two.",40.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
365,Miles 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"An elegant nose of violet and blackberry gives this Cab Franc a graceful start. On the palate, soft cherry and blackberry flavors are punctuated by spice and pepper. An interesting sip that will pair well with fowl, beef.",20.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
688,"Monte De Oro 2006 Reserve, Vista del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)","A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.",70.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
876,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Alexander School Reserve Big Barrel Syrah (Alexander Valley),"A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer.",35.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
877,Covington 2006 Rough House Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast.",30.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
900,Amity 2006 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.",17.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
948,Little Black Dress 2006 Merlot (California),"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",10.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
1245,Lavender Ridge 2006 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Made in a soft, gentle way, this pretty Mourvèdre has chocolate-infused blackberry, currant, raspberry, licorice, cola and pepper flavors. It's very dry, and will drink well with a char-broiled steak.",24.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
1252,Stonehouse 2006 Tumbas Vineyard Viognier (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"A little sugary-sweet, but the acidity is so crisp and clean, it balances things out. The pineapple, papaya, peach jam, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors are really delicious.",18.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
1254,Fenestra 2006 Silvaspoons Vineyard Verdelho (Lodi),"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites. It's a zesty, refreshing wine, with lemon-honey, peach and vanilla flavors.",15.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
1343,Fetzer 2006 Valley Oaks Riesling (California),"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",9.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
1548,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",14.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
1556,Vinum Cellars 2006 Vista Verde Vineyard Viognier (San Benito County),"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.",25.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
1565,Renwood 2006 Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.",10.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
1721,Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",18.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
1881,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Opulence Syrah (Washington),"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass.",40.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
1900,Sobon Estate 2006 Cougar Hill Zinfandel (Amador County),"Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture. There's also a wealth of firm, dusty tannins that could help the wine age for a few years.",18.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
1910,Brimstone 2006 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box.",17.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
2055,Adobe Road 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
2082,Novy 2006 Parsons' Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins.",33.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
2089,Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 113 Syrah (Mount Veeder),"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins.

2667,Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening.

2668,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",13.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
2795,McCrea 2006 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.",36.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
2855,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons.

2858,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",30.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
2972,Morrison Lane 2006 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing.",23.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
2975,Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
2977,X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety.

2979,Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi),"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",18.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
3139,Kings Mountain 2006 Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants. It's the answer to folks who complain that California Cabernets are fruit and oak bombs. Could surprise with 5–7 years in the bottle.",48.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
3295,Chalk Hill 2006 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness.

3482,Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",100.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722

3516,Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar.

3599,Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors.

3869,Valley of the Moon 2006 Cuvée de la Luna Red (Sonoma County),"A blend of all five Bordeaux red varieties, this dry, complex young wine has plenty of elegance. The blackberry, currant, tobacco and cedar flavors have a nice balance of dried herbs. Very nice now.",35.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
3875,Dunham 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very pretty and soft upon entry, with tangy boysenberry fruit, this young Syrah is sharply defined and buoyed by sharp acids.

4093,Amador Cellars 2006 Westside Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness.",25.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
4135,Sanguis 2006 Waxing Poetic Syrah (California),"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. The actual Syrah itself is clean and pure in ripe blackberry jam. Might do something over the years, but probably best now, with a decant.",75.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
4194,Tildio 2006 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"A proven success for Tildio, the newest release of Cabernet Franc uses fruit from the exceptional RiverBend vineyard in the Wahluke Slope.

4335,Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",25.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4341,Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",35.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4342,Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville),"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",40.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4344,Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",22.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4345,Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",9.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4348,Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley),"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",22.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4349,Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",32.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
4498,Barrister 2006 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah. Violets and chocolate dominate, with wild herb and cured meat flavors through the midpalate. Tannins are chewy and textured, with some stem and bark flavors.",23.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
4500,Cadaretta 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",33.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
4502,Chatter Creek 2006 Blend 105 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy, and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out, and as it does, the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast.",22.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
4637,Abacela 2006 Claret (Southern Oregon),"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
5022,Wagner 2006 Ice Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),"With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure.",22.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
5024,Andretti 2006 Selections Fumé Blanc (North Coast),"This refreshing wine is clean and dry, with grapefruit, peach and honeysuckle flavors boosted by high, tingly acidity. Made Sancerre-style, it leaves behind a spicy, fruity aftertaste.",19.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
5050,Hermann J. Wiemer 2006 Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes),"Pleasantly yeasty on the nose with hints of sweet biscuit and brioche, Wiemer's Cuvée Brut is dry and fresh with a bright, lemony midpalate. Persistently effervescent with clean, nervy acidity.",27.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
5059,Karly 2006 Buck's Ten Point Zinfandel (Amador County),"With its briary flavors of fresh-picked mountain berries and exotic clove, nutmeg and pepper spices, this Zin defines a more elegant Foothills approach to the variety. The texture is light and silky, not at all heavy, a supple, polished wine of great appeal.",20.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
5072,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",14.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
5530,Artezin 2006 Garzini Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Zin specialist Artezin gets into the Petite Sirah game with this enormously ripe, fruity wine. Shows a modern, cult interpretation of the variety, with blackberry jam, licorice, candied violet, mocha and pepper spice flavors wrapped into huge, but very finely ground, tannins.",36.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
5755,Sausal 2006 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Soft and briary, with pepper-infused flavors of wild forest berries, currants, beef jerky, leather, tobacco and sage. Enjoy this easy-drinking Zin now.",24.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
5766,Silver Lake 2006 Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills),"Oddly, Silver Lake's least expensive Merlot is its best. It's a solidly made, straight-ahead varietal wine, with a core of black olive and currant, stiff tannins and enough grip to hold up to hearty main meat dishes.",12.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
5893,Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.",40.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
5905,Quivet Cellars 2006 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),"Very black and dense, a super-young wine that shows pedigree and promise for development. Impresses for its fine structure of thick tannins and acidity, and the way the lush black currant and chocolate fruit meets the toasty oak. Good now, and should improve for up to four or five years, at least.",38.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
6070,Dancing Coyote 2006 Petite Sirah (Clarksburg),"Fans of inky black, tannicly thick and powerfully flavored Petite Sirahs will be dancing in the wine aisles over this one, from a smallish Delta appellation. It's bone dry, with intense black currant, chocolate, fig and smoky vanilla flavors, and should develop nuances for many years.",13.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
6225,:Nota Bene 2006 Verhey Vineyard Malbec (Yakima Valley),"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard.",30.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
6292,William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",45.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
6295,Peju 2006 Reserve Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",95.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
6302,Miraflores 2006 Botricelli Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is a late-harvest dessert wine blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. It's very rich and very sweet and very easy to like. Backed up with firm acidity, it shows extraordinarily ripe flavors of pineapples, apricots, oranges, honey, crème brûlée, vanilla bean, buttered toast and cinnamon spices.",40.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
6339,Baywood 2006 Vineyard Select Symphony (California),Not much going on in this off-dry wine. It has very thin flavors of vanilla and pineapples.,9.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
6350,Jacuzzi 2006 Morine Ranch Primitivo (Lake County),"Shows blackberry and cherry flavors that taste candied, almost medicinal. Okay with burgers and pizza.",22.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
6393,Pinanfarina 2006 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley),"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",55.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
6550,Montevina 2006 Pinot Grigio (Amador County),"Made in the sweet, sugary style that many consumers like, this is almost like an off-dry dessert wine. Tastes like a citrus and peach power drink, with alcohol.",10.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
6629,Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Zinfandel (Amador County),"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue. It's enormously fruity in blackberries, currants, mulberries and cinnamon-spicy mocha, with firm tannins that need rich meats to unlock. Drink soon.",24.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
6632,XYZin 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.",30.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
6634,Forchini 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",26.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
6638,Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon),"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
6640,Ca' del Solo 2006 Dolcetto (Monterey County),"High acidity gives this wine its mouth-tingling, almost sour taste, but oodles of cherries balance it. It's also pretty tannic. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with meats in rich tomato sauce, garlic and cheese.",22.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
6650,Koenig Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Merlot,"Soft berry and pepper spice aromas give this elegant red a mellow start. On the palate, savory meat and cherry flavors are touched with an herbal lift. Smooth and delicate in nature, and a pretty sipping wine.",20.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
6706,Bridgeview 2006 Viognier (Southern Oregon),"This thin, light effort carries flavors of baby aspirin, or orange candy. It's one dimensional, bearing little varietal character.",15.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6707,Castoro Cellars 2006 Roussanne (Paso Robles),"This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.",20.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6712,Bridgeview 2006 Gewürztraminer (Southern Oregon),"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",10.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6715,Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate.",12.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6719,Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",15.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6720,Shannon Ridge 2006 Grenache (Lake County),"Sharp and rustic, with medicinal, LifeSaver candy cherry flavors that finish with a scour of acidity.",28.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
6759,St. Supéry 2006 Elu Red (Napa Valley),"Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Supéry. The wine is lacks the stuffing for ageability. Drink now–2013.",65.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
6788,One Hope 2006 Merlot (California),"Dry and scoury in texture, this everyday Merlot has flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, and cedar. It has some real richness.",19.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
6889,Courtney Benham 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication.",14.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
6998,Glen Fiona 2006 Basket Press Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The best of Glen Fiona's current releases, this displays cool-climate varietal character, with mountain berry fruit, herb, spice, tar and a streak of licorice.",15.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
7123,Arbor Crest 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal – these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish.",11.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
7124,Syncline 2006 Cinsault (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a pretty, pale purple/rose; bright, peppery and rather delicate. It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine. The acids keep it lively, the peppery notes add a lot of spice and the floral qualities turn the tart cranberry fruit into something special.",22.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
7352,Viansa 2006 Merlot (Sonoma County),"Does a great job at providing identity to this variety that can often seem a bit muddled. With the structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, with more of a red fruit and red currant taste. Feels elegant and distinguished from beginning to end. Drink now.",28.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
7354,Terre Rouge 2006 High Slopes Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Full-bodied, complex and delicious, with extraordinarily ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate, grilled meat, tamari, violets, sweet fresh herbs and black pepper. Quite dry and tannic now, with a youthful, primary fruit character that suggests ageability. Best 2010–2012.",35.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
7622,Comtesse Thérèse 2006 Aquebogue Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak. There's a nice, lush texture and body, and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate. The fruit flavors may be slightly lacking in concentration, but supple tannins make for smooth, easy sipping.",18.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
7799,Adamant Cellars 2006 Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy, slightly resinous with notes of leaf, clove and licorice that complement good dark cassis fruit. Some coffee and smoke enter into the middle and finish, though the flavors fall away rather quickly. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink, but not built for cellaring.",23.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
7986,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Morelli Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine. It has the structure of a gentle Merlot, but with the wild cherry and raspberry, date nut cake, cocoa, pepper and clove flavors that make it so distinctive and savory. This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",40.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
7997,Chateau St. Jean 2006 La Petite Etoile Fumé Blanc (Russian River Valley),"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",20.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722

8088,Bella 2006 Belle Canyon Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"More tannic than in past vintages, Bella's '06 Belle Canyon shows the same briary, brambly flavors, with spicy wild berries and olive tapenade accented with fresh green sage, black pepper and rosemary. Drink this exuberant Zin soon, with spicy grilled meats.",35.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
8270,Orchid Hill 2006 Private Reserve Viognier (Paso Robles),"What a great improvement the '06 is over the '05. It's considerably lower in alcohol, and much more balanced and crisp. Yet the flavors are ripe and seductive, in peaches, pears, papayas, honeysuckle flowers and oak-influenced butter, honey and vanilla. Great with Thai food.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722

8790,Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking.",42.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
8823,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This lively, 100% Sauvignon Blanc sports fresh flavors of grapefruit, lemon meringue and quinine—much like a cool-climate Viognier.

8933,Handley 2006 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"So rich, so honeyed, with an oily texture, this Gewurz is simply wonderful. It shows powerfully ripe peach, pineapple, pear, honeysuckle, lemon cream and dusty spicebox flavors. With balancing acidity, it's California Gewurz at its most charming.",18.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
8965,Kana 2006 Old Vines Red (Yakima Valley),"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate—what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself.",18.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
8976,Milbrandt 2006 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine.",25.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
9419,Zaca Mesa 2006 Z Cuvée Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A Châteauneuf-style blend, based on Grenache, that's clean, fresh and savory. It shows cherry, currant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped into a soft texture. Oak adds a pleasant, subtle note of smoke.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
9420,Hayman & Hill 2006 Reserve Selection Meritage (Monterey County),"Shows great improvement over last year's so-so bottling.

9433,Iron Horse 2006 Russian Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"This is one of Iron Horse's sweeter sparkling wines. There's a sugary edge to the raspberry, strawberry, lime and orange flavors.

9645,Krupp Brothers 2006 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),"Napa red wine hardly gets more delicious than this. It's so soft and velvety, so rich in chocolate, blackberry and smoky oak flavors, that you can't resist sip after sip. It really defines the modern Napa style. The blend is Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, and the grapes were grown on the winery's estate vineyard in the heart of Atlas Peak.",75.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
9706,Selene 2006 Frediani Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Marked by a great big burst of ripe fruit, this Merlot is distinctly New World in origin. You can taste the sunshine in the purity of the blackberry, cherry and plum flavors. With complex but soft tannins, it's so polished, you can drink it by itself.",40.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
10003,San Juan Vineyards 2006 Siegerrebe (Puget Sound),"Light and tart, mixing grapefruit, lychee, mineral and floral aromas, all evident here. Very spicy, it is a bit like Gewürztraminer without the floral highlights. The Brix (under 20) leads to a thin wine that doesn't quite reach 12% alcohol.",15.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
10019,Tertulia 2006 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Suffers from the common new winery kinds of faults. Overpriced for the competition; there are odd, off scents suggesting hay, honey, and yeast. It feels awkward on the palate, disjointed and incomplete.",18.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
10022,La Crema 2006 Viognier (Sonoma County),"If you “talk dry and taste sweet,” as they say, you'll like this wine. It's not really dry at all. But it's very rich in tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and spice flavors that are balanced out by good enough acidity.",20.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
10338,Kenwood 2006 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This Zin shows classic Sonoma County character, but it's also a tannic, young wine that wants a little time in the bottle. Tasted at the age of two, it's astringent and jammy, with pepper-infused blackberry and mulberry flavors and a gamy touch of smoked beef. Give it until mid-2009, when it will be fantastic with grilled beef.",25.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
10341,Stephen & Walker 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Dusty Asian spices mark this beautifully varietal wine. It's classic Sonoma Zin, totally dry and firmly tannic, with a wealth of smoky, briary wild berry, tobacco and tamari flavors. Bring on the sausage.",39.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722

10747,Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Big, rich and extracted, this Syrah is a bit heavy and ponderous now. It shows soft flavors of melted blackberry jam, plum liqueur, dark chocolate, grilled meat and smoky oak, liberally dusted with black pepper. Fancy, but could use through 2009 to knit together.",40.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
10753,Whitehall Lane 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),"A beautiful Merlot, noble and classic. It doesn't have the stuffing for cellaring, but is absolutely lovely now, with fine, brisk tannins framing flavors of cherries, herbs and sweet oak, and a lingering finish. Easy to find, with 12,100 cases produced.",28.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
10897,Q 2006 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Jammy and sharp, with raspberry and cherry flavors. Bone dry and low in alcohol, but too tart for a better score.",26.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
11142,"Wölffer 2006 Fatalis Fatum Red (The Hamptons, Long Island)","Appealing aromas of tobacco, smoke and spice herald the masculine edge to this red blend. Flavors of chocolate, smoke, spicebox and pepper are carried by a bright, red fruit wave. A touch tart on the finish but overall well rounded.",40.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
11287,Charles Krug 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),"What a pretty wine. Made for drinking soon, it shows impeccable balance in the finely ground tannins, moderate alcohol and deft touch of oak. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, carrying flavors of berries, herbs, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to find, with 16,056 cases produced.",24.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
11418,Langtry 2006 Serpentine Meadow Petite Sirah (Guenoc Valley),"A fine Petite Sirah, dark, full bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, mocha, leather, herbs and spices. Feels good and clean in the mouth, with chewy tannins and a long, rich finish.",40.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
11498,Crinella 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California. It's not without fruit. You'll find mouthwatering Meyer lemons, sweet Kaffir limes and spicy figs. Just beautiful, and a real sommelier's wine.",22.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
11622,Claar 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a bit stinky right out of the bottle, with some sour, rotten egg aromas. Ultimately they blow off, but there's still a palate impression of sulfur and burnt match. The net effect is to put a damper on the fruit, which pokes through the sulfurous fog tasting rather soapy and limpid.",12.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
11624,Naches Heights 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Flat, fruity and lacking in complexity.",16.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
11632,Two Wives 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a thin line between attractive gooseberry and hay aromas, and more severe pungency. This wine is strong in the latter.",16.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
11635,Naches Heights 2006 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A flat tasting, slightly sweet, generic white wine.",16.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
12014,MacMurray Ranch 2006 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"Succulent and crisp; those two words are what you want in a California Pinot Gris, and you get them here. The pear, pineapple, peach and fig flavors are balanced with refreshing acidity, while a touch of oak and sur lie aging adds accents of smoke and creamy vanilla.",20.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
12340,Jason-Stephens 2006 Syrah (Central Coast),"Overly soft and simple and quite sugary sweet, like an inexpensive Port-style wine. Shows flavors of berries, currants and chocolate. Drink now.",24.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
12346,Love and Meritage 2006 Meritage (Napa Valley),"Solid and tasty, with blackberry, black currant, mocha and oak flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Easy to drink with steaks and chops.",28.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
12347,Myriad Cellars 2006 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),"This is a dark, drily tannic young Syrah whose blackberry, currant and pepper flavors are compromised by less ripe, minty tastes. It's so close to being a really nice wine, until that greenness kicks in. Drink now.",38.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
12389,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2006 Merlot (Lake County),"Although it's totally dry, this Merlot is a little too sharp, with a bite of acidity marring otherwise pleasant flavors of cherries, chocolate, mint and herbs. At its best now.",30.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
12439,DiStefano 2006 domenica Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This appealing Bordeaux blend opens with seductive mocha and milk chocolate aromas, threaded with cedar and toast. The fruit stands up to the wood, with pretty berry and rhubarb flavors. Extra bottle age has smoothed it out.",20.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722

12567,Enkidu 2006 Odyssey Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Smells and tastes not quite ripe. Now that the wine is softening and resolving at the age of 3-1/2 years, it's showing a streak of veggie green behind the cherries.",34.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
12573,Pietra Santa 2006 Sangiovese (Cienega Valley),"Too soft, lacking vital structure, and too sweet for a dry table wine. Shows candied flavors of berries and cherries.",18.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
12817,Chronic Cellars 2006 Sofa King Bueno Red (Paso Robles),"This Rhône-style blend is harsh and rugged, with unripe mintiness, but it has enough cherry, berry and mocha flavors to pass.",20.0,80,3,0.9523485422044722
12824,Alpha Omega 2006 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This is a big, powerful Bordeaux blend that clearly needs time. Tasted in early 2009, it's very tannic and dry, although you can detect the massive cassis and plum flavors. It would be a pity to open before 2012, if you can keep your hands off it. Could eventually stun. Alpha Omega is a winery to watch.",82.0,95,3,0.9523485422044722
13050,Signorello 2006 Padrone Red (Napa Valley),"Lots of voluptuous softness in the mouth, like velvet gliding over the palate. But you'll also experience serious tannins that hit midway, creating a lockdown astringency. Evidence of ageability lies in the massive core of blackberries and cassis, as well as the overall balance and tang of acidity on the finish. This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend should hit its stride after 2012 and continue for many years.",110.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
13052,Merryvale 2006 Profile Red (Napa Valley),"Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade.",135.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
13352,Hauck 2006 Meritage (Sonoma County),"This is a pretty, polished wine to drink now with a nice steak. It's soft and rich in jammy cherry, berry and spice flavors. Earns extra credit for sheer lusciousness and drinkability.",38.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
13466,Iron Horse 2006 Brut X Sparkling (Green Valley),"This is one of Iron Horse's drier wines, with a low dosage, but it's still fairly sweet. There's a coating of sugar on the raspberries, oranges and limes. The bubbles are a bit scoury now, but this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend could develop nuances in the cellar after, say, 2013.",50.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
13488,Gloria Ferrer 2006 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Carneros),"Chardonnay grapes star in this rich bubbly. It's attractive in pear, orange, papaya and toast flavors, with a fine edge of sourdough yeast. The bubbles are a little scoury, but otherwise this is a good price for a vintage sparkling wine.",24.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
13528,Side Job 2006 Stefani Vineyard C5 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"They should put this in a time capsule as a classic example of early 20th century California Zinfandel. Lusty, soft and high in alcohol, it features superripe, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, red currants and chocolate, with all kinds of peppery spices.",30.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722

14117,Watermill 2006 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"French oak fermentation and sur lie aging give this wine just a hint of toast and softness in the mouth. It is just at 14% alcohol, which keeps it from getting either too bitter or too hot in the finish. It's downright elegant, with a refreshing light touch that is all too often missing from Viognier.",14.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
14123,Viento 2006 Lonesome Spring Ranch Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This barrel fermented Viognier delivers an intense nose mixing scents of flowers (lily of the valley), lime skin, green pineapple and a dash of papaya. Cool, crisp and utterly delicious, it is a perfect sipping wine, elegantly structured and under 14% alcohol.",16.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
14634,Tamás Estates 2006 Pinot Grigio (Monterey),"Shows the bright, zesty acidity and citrus and floral flavors that characterize this variety. The alcohol is refreshingly low, only 13%, but the wine is thoroughly dry. Very nice for an aperitif sipper, with shellfish, or with goat cheese and roasted peppers on toasted sourdough.",12.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
14722,Arns 2006 Syrah (Napa Valley),"Some pruny overripeness shows up in this Syrah, while masses of sweetly charred oak give a candied taste. Although the wine is technically dry, it's a bit clumsy. Give it a good decant and drink now.",50.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
14951,Handley 2006 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a very nice, dry and versatile red wine to drink with everything from steak and pork to tacos and skewered chicken or beef with peanut sauce. It's rich in cherries, blackberries, mocha and peppery spices, and fully dry, with smooth tannins. Drink now.",20.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
14971,Cottonwood Canyon 2006 Synergy Classic Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot with a bit of Norman Beko's estate Syrah shows concentrated blueberry, tobacco, dried dill, leather and sweet cedar aromas on the nose, in accordance with its age. There are elegant purple flower, caramelized fruit and mocha spice flavors on the palate, which is holding up well but should be enjoyed now.",68.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
15580,Maddalena 2006 Pinot Grigio (Monterey),"Give credit to cool Monterey for yielding a wine that's this dry, with acidic long hangtime fruit. It's this type of PG that has made the variety an overnight success. The acids perk up the palate, making the pineapple, peach, fig and wildflower flavors bright and tangy.",14.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
15586,Bonny Doon 2006 Le Vol des Anges Beeswax Vineyard Roussanne (Arroyo Seco),"This is a new dessert wine from Bonny Doon, from the Arroyo Seco region which is such a great source of whites. With 11% residual sugar, it's quite sweet. The apricot, peach, pear and lime flavors have a honeyed, botrytised richness.",30.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
15593,Pietra Santa 2006 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley),"The appellation is in San Benito County, a terroir that has plenty of coastal influence. Acidity and ripeness are the stars in this bright, expressive, dry but fruity wine, with pineapple, lime and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Viognier.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
15611,Prager 2006 Petite Sirah Port (California),"Tremendously sweet in blackberry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, with a fine bite of acidity. It's a satisfying dessert wine for drinking with chocolate, or try pecan pie, but it would score far higher if it were richer.",32.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
15663,Chateau Rollat 2006 Sophie de Rollat Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright. The fruit focus is on cranberry and raspberry, tart and well-defined, and the wine is immaculately clean. It's light and charming, but a perfect choice for autumnal foods.",29.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
15666,Des Voigne Cellars 2006 San Remo Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Interesting to see that Washington State vineyards can ripen Sangio in a wide range of microclimates; this is true to the variety with tart acids, sharp flavors of berry, hints of pumpkin pie spice and tobacco, and just enough butterscotch barrel notes to fill in around the rough edges. This is good winemaking, with a tough grape.",26.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
15667,Des Voigne Cellars 2006 The Emcee Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is Pepper Bridge Merlot, and it beautifully expresses the vineyard trademarks: fresh fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, spread out broadly across the palate, and backed with tart acids and light tannins. There is a strong streak of Asian spicebox as well, but overall the wineis very approachable, which makes it is a Merlot to enjoy with rich fish, such as salmon. It's bright and lightly spicy and not too heavy.",28.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
15672,Mark Ryan 2006 Water Witch Klipsun Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Stiff, tannic, earthy and wrapped up tight. It's a big, bruiser of a wine, oaky, earthy and showing liquorous barrel flavors. Tasted three times over a four month period, it remains quite tight and hidden; the fruit is there but it's very difficult to get this wine to open up. In time, therating could significantly improve.",45.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
15925,Mirassou 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A fine, everyday Sauvignon, marked by the crisp, zesty acidity and citrus fruits that characterize the variety. The flavors of lemongrass, limes and grapefruits are made richer by layers of figs and sweet peppermint.",12.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
16022,Gustafson Family 2006 Mountain Cuvée Red (Dry Creek Valley),"A good, rich, somewhat rustic blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Syrah, made from the estate vineyard. It's bone dry and tannic, with blackberry tart, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Drink this lusty wine now.",24.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
16023,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2006 Barrack Brand Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Approaches a fine North Coast Bordeaux bottling in the complex blackberry and currant flavors and dryness, but there are problems. Acidity is high and fairly intrusive, and the oak tannins seem to dominate. Work needs to be done, but this Merlot-based blend gets an A for effort.",40.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
16123,Terre Rouge 2006 Sentinel Oak Vineyard Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Here's a big, juicy, imposingly rich Syrah that's so stuffed with primary fruit character, it needs time in the cellar to come around. Tasted in January, it's enormous in sweet, jammy blackberries, melted milk chocolate, licorice, cherry pie filling and all kinds of peppery spices. Better sometime in 2010, and could become quite dramatic after that.",40.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
16126,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Taylor Peak Merlot (Bennett Valley),"It's all there with this rich Merlot. Fabulously lush in currants, mocha and cedar, it also displays great balance and charm. The tannins are superfine. Drink this beauty now through 2010.",50.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
16129,Eaglepoint Ranch 2006 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Fans of “Pet” will exult at this wildly exuberant wine. Grown in a dramatic mountain vineyard high above the Central Mendocino plain, it's bone dry and gigantic in tannins, with massive flavors of black currants, red meat, charred meat bone and pepper. Will age for at least a decade.",26.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
16169,Col Solare 2006 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Col Solare, the collaboration between Ste. Michelle and Antinori, brought in the first estate grapes this year, but it will be awhile before it becomes an estate wine. The current vintage uses five varieties from a half dozen vineyards scattered across four different AVAs. It's soft, fruity and open, with a firm core of black fruits wrapped into lightly smoky, polished tannins.",70.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
16173,Tulpen 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Deep and refined, this beautifully integrated Syrah opens with scents of briar, berry, and cherry. Details of light pepper, iron and earth are buoyed by vivid acids. Complex, aromatic and graceful.",30.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
16189,W.S. Keyes 2006 Merlot (Howell Mountain),"Lots of new oak on this young Merlot, and the wood dominates, sending out waves of toast, clove and vanilla-buttered toast aromas. Oak tannins join the grapeskin tannins in making the mouthfeel hard and astringent. The underlying flavors are of blackberries, black cherries, red licorice and unsweetened baker's chocolate. It's a good wine that should develop bottle complexity through 2012.",90.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
16283,Emilio's Terrace 2006 Sophie's Rows Red (Oakville),"A disappointment after the rich 2005. They should have declassified this vintage. The wine is dry and sharp, with green, sharp acids and modest berry, currant and herb flavors.",75.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
16290,VC Cellars 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"For those who like their Zins on the sweet side, this one's rich in raspberry and cherry jam flavor, with the sweet, honeyed taste of glycerine from high alcohol.",25.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
16555,Laetitia 2006 Cuvée M Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Sort of a junior version of the winery's pricier vineyard block bruts, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is addictively good. Slightly sweet in honey, it has lime, raspberry and yeast flavors, in a richly textured mousse.",35.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
16622,Nadia 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Red (Santa Barbara County),"A little rugged in the mouth, with some fierce tannins, but otherwise a pretty good Cabernet-based wine. The berry-cherry and currant flavors will benefit from an hour or two of airing.",35.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
16719,O•S Winery 2006 Dineen Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Certain Yakima valley vineyards attain a riveting complexity with Syrah—Dineen is one of them. The mix of wild berry, pomegranate syrup, coffee liqueur, composted earth, smoke and chocolate is compelling. This is Syrah that stands apart from most other New World versions, has the acid and balance to age, and the complexity to keep you coming back for another glass.",35.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
17045,Mosby 2006 Primitivo (Central Coast),"A tartly acidic, jammy wine. Shows Zin-like flavors of raspberries, cherries and black pepper, with a sweet coat of sandalwood.",26.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
17164,Amavi 2006 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent with recent vintages, this lovely Sémillon opens immediately into a creamy, leesy, expressive core. Scents of green apple, lemon and beeswax turn into lush fruit flavors of melon, pear and citrus. It shows far more complex and interesting fruit character than most unoaked Chardonnays—here, the acids are not intrusive, but come up naturally in the back of the throat.",20.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
17172,L'Ecole No. 41 2006 Fries Vineyard Sémillon (Wahluke Slope),"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast.",20.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
17205,Buena Vista 2006 Merlot (Carneros),"Soft and herbal, this pretty, polished Merlot offers gentle flavors of cherries, currants, cola and violets, touched with oak. It's a very clean, elegant wine, meant to pair with upscale fare, and fully ready to drink now.",21.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
17206,Clary Ranch 2006 Grower's Reserve Shazzam! Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"The name suggests the Aussie Shiraz style of this richly fruity Syrah. It offers a mouthburst of juicy raspberries, blackberries, cherries, cocoa, bacon, licorice and sandalwood, wrapped into firm tannins. Drink now, with rich fare, like BBQ or a holiday smoked ham.",28.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
17207,Columbia Crest 2006 Two Vines Merlot-Cabernet (Columbia Valley (WA)),"It is amazing that 134,000 cases of this budget bottling can be made to this level of quality. From a classic vintage, it's structured and substantial, overcoming the somewhat overdone vanilla flavors with great fruit and firm acids.",8.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
17215,Buena Vista 2006 Syrah (Carneros),"Clean, dry and spicy, this full-bodied wine has earthy flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon and sweet tobacco. Drink now.",23.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
17269,DeLorimier 2006 Sangiovese (Alexander Valley),"It's unheard of for a winery to hold back a Sangiovese for more than four years before releasing it, but DeLorimier did. It's done the wine well, allowing it to soften and mellow. It's still quite acidic, and a little rustic as California Sangiovese tends to be, but there's a lot of deliciousness. Try as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir.",29.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
17292,Charbay 2006 Distillers' Port (Napa Valley),"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.",75.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
17436,Donati 2006 Pinot Blanc (Paicines),"Here's a pretty good white that you can have as an alternative to Chardonnay. It's creamy and full-bodied, with tangerine, peach custard and honeysuckle flavors. Could use greater acidity, because it's a little on the soft side.",15.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
17449,Capitello 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This Pinot Gris offers a distinctive mix of flavors, with apple, pear, pink grapefruit and sweet Meyer lemon all in the tangle of fruit. It's sappy and soft, but runs afoul of some mousy, bacterial flavors in the finish. Except for that, it would score much better.",18.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
17455,Peirano 2006 The Other White (Lodi),"Made from Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, this fruity white shows lots of complexity for the money. It's crisp and off-dry, with citrus, peach, honeysuckle and spice flavors finished with a kiss of smoky, vanilla oak.",14.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
17511,Brotherhood 2006 Dry Riesling (New York),"Creamy on the nose with a scent of musk and flowers, this wine from Brotherhood is too angular to fully enjoy. The acidity is good but the overall flavors are lean.",11.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
17516,Hermes 2006 Estate Bottled Nebbiolo (Ohio),"Fruits, flowers and spice should lead the nose and bathe the palate with this Nebbiolo, but the wine falls flat, with bitter, sweet flavors that are astringent in nature and lack elegance.",15.0,80,3,0.9523485422044722
17583,Renwood 2006 Viognier (Lodi),"Crisp acidity comes to the rescue of this slightly sweet wine, giving it a bracing mouthfeel that balances the sugary pineapple, peach, apricot and honeysuckle flavors.",10.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
17590,Lockwood 2006 Malbec (Monterey County),"Lockwood hitches a ride on the Argentine Malbec express, with mixed results. The wine is dark and acidic and properly bone dry, with earthy, dark berry, coffee, leather and bitter chocolate flavors. But there's a disagreeable green sharpness.",14.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
17591,Ludwig 2006 Sweetwater Vineyard Riesling (Monterey),"From a vineyard called Sweetwater, this Riesling itself is sweet in peach, pineapple and wildflower honey flavors. Brisk Monterey acidity balances, with a tart, prickly mouthfeel.",13.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
17824,Domaine Alfred 2006 Da Red Red (Central Coast),Sometimes all you need is a rustic bottle of good red wine and your favorite food to be happy. That's the kind of wine this Pinot Noir and Syrah blend is. It's dry and full-bodied and filled with berry flavors that don't take a lot of analysis to enjoy.,18.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
18099,Vision Cellars 2006 Blanc Gris White (California),"Two of the crispest and most savory white varieties in California are Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris/Grigio, and this blend of both shows the best qualities of each. It's just slightly off-dry and vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and vanilla flavors, with beautiful acidity.",18.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
18115,Carr 2006 Turner Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sta. Rita Hills),"Ripe and crisp in acidity, this 100% Pinot Gris comes from a single vineyard in this highly regarded Santa Barbara County appellation. The wine never saw oak, so the pineapple, apple butter, mango and vanilla flavors come entirely from the grapes.",18.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
18616,Cadence 2006 Ciel du Cheval Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"Dense and juicy, bursting with a mix of berries and cassis.

18623,Terra d'Oro 2006 Home Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"A beautiful Zinfandel from a winery with lots of know-how. The wine is medium-bodied, with a graceful structure of finely ground tannins that makes it drinkable right away. The flavors are pure mountain Zin, intense in peppery currants, cocoa and licorice.",29.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
18624,Barrister 2006 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"These Dwelley vineyard grapes display bright raspberry fruit, lively acids, and a more tightly refined structure than the other Barrister Merlots. Along with the higher acidity of the 2006 vintage, there seems to be a more gentle touch with the new oak as well, although plenty of coffee and smoke flavors roll out in the finish.",25.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
18625,Cadence 2006 Cara Mia Vineyard Bel Canto Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker.",55.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
18626,Cadence 2006 Tapteil Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"The Tapteil vineyard designate is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cab Franc and 32% Merlot, from vines that are now 20 years old. With each new vintage the wine seems to gain in detail as a result. Tapteil fruit is distinguished by a distinctive dustiness, and sports an elegant structure whoselightness belies its power. With its spicy, acidic berry flavors, and hints of smoke and leather, this has an Italian personality as well.",45.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
18681,Brassfield 2006 High Serenity Ranch Pinot Grigio (High Valley),"Brassfield is establishing a fine track record with this wine. It's wonderfully crisp and clean in acidity, with pure flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, apricots, wildflowers and white pepper. Fine as an aperitif sipper, or with almost anything that wants a dry, zesty white.",15.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
18721,C.G. di Arie 2006 Petite Sirah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Grilled beef, slathered in BBQ sauce, will soften and sweeten this hearty red from the Sierra Foothills.

18733,Two Angels 2006 Divinity Red (High Valley),"Soft and sweetly gentle, this everyday wine has likeable flavors of black cherries, raspberries, chocolate, dates and black pepper. Blend is Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Petite Sirah.",27.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
19081,Adelaida 2006 Reserve The Glenrose Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),"Pretty much as good as Paso Robles Syrah gets. Shows incredibly fine tannic structure and ripe, luscious flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cola, cocoa, bacon and sweet, smoky sandalwood from oak barrels. Pull it back a little in fruit, and it's near perfect. Drink now.",55.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
19091,Apex 2006 Dry Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% Riesling, and the intense, floral aromas suggest a smattering of Gewürztraminer, at least in essence if not in fact. Beeswax, lemon candy, orange blossom and other juicy citrus components swirl around the palate, making this an exceptionally complex and beguiling wine. Though labeled dry, it carries an impression of fruit sweetness, rather than the bracing minerality of some other dry Rieslings. A wine that is almost Germanic in its attack, and a truly lovely bottle.",20.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
19230,"Monte De Oro 2006 Reserve, Vista del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)","A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.",70.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
19343,Big House 2006 The Prodigal Son Petite Sirah (Central Coast),"Break out the barbecued burgers and ribs for this lusty, hearty red wine. It's dry and very tannic, with earthy flavors of blackberries, currants and spices.",15.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
19428,Mazzocco 2006 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Mazzocco's style has settled into high alcohol, in this case 15.8%, sweet, jammy pie-filling fruit flavors, and soft tannins. If this is the kind of Zin you enjoy, it's for you.",40.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
19430,Opolo 2006 Mountain Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"You'll find some mint and vegetal aromas and flavors side-by-side with intense, sugary sweet blackberry jam ones in this Zin. It's unbalanced to that degree.",28.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
19431,Opolo 2006 Summit Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Too hot and sweet, this Zin weighs in at 16.2% of alcohol. It has blackberry and cocoa flavors spiced with chile peppers.",19.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
19432,Mazzocco 2006 Warm Springs Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Tastes sweet and hot, like an inexpensive Port, with sugary cherry-berry jam flavors. The official alcohol is 16%.",32.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
19435,Muscardini 2006 Pauli Ranch Barbera (Mendocino County),"This Barbera is soft, sweet and simple. It shows the rich tannins of the variety, but isn't ageworthy. Tastes like melted blackberry jam mixed with anise, black pepper and smoke.",47.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722

19781,Tandem 2006 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Sonoma Mountain),"Rarely bottled on its own, Pinot Meunier is better known as a blending component for Champagne. This bottling is like a Pinot Noir in its lightly silky texture and cherry, cola and vanilla flavors. It's very elegant, yet doesn't quite rise to the classic status of Pinot Noir.",60.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
19802,Big Ass 2006 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Here's a pretty good Zin that will win fans for its fruity, spicy flavors. It's kind of sweet, but the acidity is crisp and the tannins are rich, which helps to balance the pie-filling raspberries and cherries.",15.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
19809,Michael David 2006 Petite Petit Red (Lodi),"This cleverly named blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot is rustically likeable. It's a soft, slightly sweet and gigantically fruity wine, with some softening, creamy influence from oak.",18.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
20004,Zerba Cellars 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very firm and tannic, this gently earthy Merlot-dominated blend also includes 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. Cranberry and pomegranate red fruits are softened with buttery oak, and the wine shows more polish than in previous vintages.",30.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
20018,Robert Hall 2006 Hall Ranch Meritage (Paso Robles),"Rich in smoky oak and ripe fruit, showing powerful, dry flavors of blackberries, black cherries, sour cherry candy and sweet herbs. The tannins are a bit scoury and edgy, like sandpaper on the palate. Should mellow over the next 2–3 years, but it's not an ager.",41.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
20267,Peter Cellars 2006 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a smooth, easy- drinking Syrah that shows plenty of class. The blackberry, beef teriyaki, black pepper and leather flavors are brightened with acidity, while a touch of new oak adds some nice smokiness.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
20373,Beringer 2006 Alluvium Red (Knights Valley),"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties, this wine is dry and a bit rustic. It shows pepper and thyme-infused flavors of blackberries and currants, finished with some astringent tannins. Drink soon.",30.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
20376,Novy 2006 Stolpman Vineyard Nebbiolo (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made in the Novy style, which seems to get a little softer and sweeter every year. Nonetheless, shows an interesting interpretation of this difficult Italian variety. It's a light-colored, light-bodied wine, with high acids and cherry jam and mocha flavors.",33.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
20381,Viansa 2006 Prindelo Red (Sonoma County),"Full-bodied, tannic, juicy-fruity and dry, this red blend has flavors of blackberries, plums, dark chocolate and anise, with spicy, earthy notes of tobacco. Made from Primitivo, Zinfandel and Teroldego.",35.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
20920,Turnbull 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Oakville),"Ungainly, with stiff, puckery tannins giving a hard astringency, and unintegrated oak sticking out. Somewhere inbetween are modest cherry, anise and herb flavors. Pretty good, but not likely to go anywhere, so drink now.",35.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
20921,Jalama 2006 Paradise Road Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A dry, tannic and severe Syrah. It's tart and sandpapery in the mouth, with a scoury mouthfeel, and although you'll find some cherries and currants, there's not enough richness to counterbalance the toughness.",30.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
21030,Dominus 2006 Red (Napa Valley),"Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.",99.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
21034,Terra Valentine 2006 Marriage Red (Spring Mountain District),"Dramatically rich and structured, this mountain blend of Bordeaux varieties needs time in the cellar. Right now, it's tannic and astringent, with youthful flavors of blackberries, minerals and smoky new oak. But it's a very fine wine that should hold and mellow through 2014.",75.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
21036,Balboa 2006 Sayulita Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Named for a favored surf spot in Mexico, Sayulita is a new project from Balboa. This first release, from the Lefore vineyard, is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Syrah, a perfect mix and showcase for the strengths of both. Soft and smooth, it's tightly woven with veins of earth, pepper, black olive, coffee, black fruits and licorice.",40.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
21272,Calcareous 2006 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),"Petite Verdot is a hard variety to succeed on its own, but Calcareous has produced a fine, dry wine made from that Bordeaux variety. It's full-bodied and complex, with flavors of currants, mushu plum sauce, violets, dark chocolate and anise. Such are the tannins that the wine should develop through 2010.",28.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
21282,PharaohMoans 2006 Westside Syrah (Paso Robles),"This very dry wine is dominated by its hard tannins, and comes across as a bit rigid and austere, especially by California standards. Yet it's very finely structured, with a keen edge of black pepper to the currant and blackberry flavors buried way beneath. Give it through 2009, but if you must drink now, decant.",125.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
21289,Martella 2006 Hammer Syrah (California),"Martella's Hammer Syrah, which is a statewide blend, consistently is as good as, if not better than, its more expensive bottlings. As in the past, the '06 is very dry, crisp and somewhat tannic. What it lacks in fruity richness it more than makes up in structural balance and elegance, but you'll find enough cherry, currant, tobacco and sweet oak flavors to satisfy.",24.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
21439,Berryessa Gap 2006 Syrah (Yolo County),"Lots of fruity richness in this dry Syrah. Shows blackberry, chocolate, licorice and pie crust flavors. The tannins are somewhat unbalanced, suggesting work needs to be done in the vineyard.",16.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21444,Château Julien 2006 Private Reserve Merlot (Monterey County),"Very, very ripe in blackberries, currants and prunes, with oak elaborations. The flavors are rich, but the wine is a bit lacking in structure and depth of interest. Drink now.",40.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21450,Messina Hof 2006 Private Reserve Double Barrel Shiraz (Texas),"This wine has a very direct appeal, with blueberry and boysenberry fruit, shot through with notes of earth and mushroom. The palate is juicy, smooth and reasonably crisp. Medium finish shows notes of forest floor and no tannin. Try with tuna in a bold sauce.",22.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722

21499,Decoy 2006 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This is Duckhorn's second label for their Napa Bordeaux reds, and with this '06 vintage, it's on the thin, herbal side, with only modest cherry-berry flavors. Dry and very tannic, it's not an ager.",30.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21556,Daedalus 2006 Elton Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Willamette Valley),"This is a solid effort, with good varietal character and definition. Half was fermented in stainless, half in neutral barrel, and the wine was given extended (130 days) lees contact. The herbal, peppery tang of the grape is clearly there, with intriguing hints of slate laced through the finish. This would be dynamite with sushi.",21.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
21601,RoxyAnn 2006 Claret Red (Rogue Valley),"It's 40% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 25% Merlot, all from the estate vineyards. Some plum and cherry fruit starts it up, moves quickly into a light finish, and leaves an impression of some green tannins as it fades.",26.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21611,Viansa 2006 Farneta Primitivo (Carneros),"Tastes like a rustic Zinfandel, with spicy, briary flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and dark chocolate. The tannins are somewhat green and angular.",35.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21613,Valley View 2006 Anna Maria Tempranillo (Applegate Valley),"The Tempranillo—bud wood from Abacela—was grafted onto 30-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Not sure how many vintages have been made, but it's too soon to rate the experiment. This is a lightly toasty, rather elegant red with little varietal character, but it's nicely built and perfectly fine for a simple supper.",26.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
21932,Lake Sonoma 2006 Saini Farms Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a good, rich, savory young Zin to get those tastebuds whistling. Clean acidity and smooth tannins frame Zinny flavors of wild berries, teriyaki and Asian spices. Drink now.",22.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
21947,Chatter Creek 2006 Lonesome Spring Ranch Syrah (Yakima Valley),"True to past vintages, this is a peppery Syrah from a cooler site, putting the accent on very tart and tight fruit flavors of wild berries and aromatic herbs. It's well balanced and the tannins are reasonably ripe, with good grip.",28.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
22018,Sunstone 2006 Eros Estate Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"There are some fine flavors of cassis and cedar in this dry Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but it has textural challenges in the tough tannins and cutting acidity that seems to come from green fruit or stems. Drink now.",56.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
22226,Chatter Creek 2006 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lonesome Spring and Clifton fruit goes into this Grenache, which includes 16% Syrah and 8% Mourvèdre. Very spicy and pretty aromas invite sipping; the white pepper stands out, along with tart raspberry/cranberry fruit. The wine feels just a little bit chalky in the mouth, but that actually sets it up well for simple smoked or grilled meats.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
22234,Twisted Oak 2006 Viognier (Calaveras County),"This Viognier was grown in a warm climate, and that has made it slightly soft but enormously ripe. It offers a blast of tropical fruit, wildflower, Asian pear, buttered toast, caramel cream and spicebox flavors. There's a honeyed richness through the long finish, but the wine is fundamentally dry.",22.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
22293,Pride Mountain 2006 Merlot (Sonoma-Napa),"Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.",56.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
22298,Pride Mountain 2006 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),"This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.",60.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
22486,Alma Rosa 2006 Pinot Gris (Santa Barbara County),"The acidity on this fine wine makes your mouth water, giving a clean bite to the pineapple, orange, sweet cream, honeysuckle and cinnamon-spice flavors. The balance of tartness and sweetness is what makes the wine so appealing.",20.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
22501,Huntington 2006 Zinfandel (California),"Most of the grapes in this statewide blend came from Lodi and Paso Robles, and it has the character of a warm-climate Zin.

22550,Trust 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vineyard sources for this 100% varietal Syrah were mostly Yakima Valley growers; the cooperage was all French (22% new) and the alcohol levels were in proportion with the overall balance. It's a good wine, though not up to the standard of the exceptional Trust 2005 Syrah. Here you'll find light flavors of berry and tomato, fresh herbs and a little green edge to the tannins.",28.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722

22562,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2006 Hell's Kitchen Red (Paso Robles),"This Rhône blend is based on Syrah. It's a typically soft, lush and slightly sweet Paso Robles red wine, with easy flavors of red currants, raspberries, cherries, chocolate, beef jerky and pepper.",48.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
22566,Olson Ogden 2006 Unti Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a useful Syrah to generate some interest around a grilled steak or chop. It's rich in tannins and forwardly sweet in black cherry, blackberry, tobacco, leather, cinnamon and pepper flavors, and should develop for a few years.",38.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
22689,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Ethos Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Merlot requires some extended breathing time before opening up. The fruit sources include Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge and the Wahluke Slope, bringing lush cherry/berry fruit to the fore, ripened to a level just below jammy. The tannins carry a hint of green, turning a little rough in the finish.",31.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722

23033,Sineann 2006 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (OR)),"So rich it's almost fat, this unctuous Gewürztraminer mingles massive floral rose petal flavors with a lightly soapy, caramel core. The fruit is soft and round and mixes up a wide variety of tropical flavors, mixed in with the oily, floral flavors of the grape. Creamy and lush, it's like a vendange tardive only dry.",18.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
23034,Stevenot 2006 Persuasion Verdelho (California),"Stevenot has tinkered with Verdelho for years, and the work is paying off. This is a wonderful wine that fills a much needed niche in California whites. It's dry and crisp in the way of Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, but incredibly rich in flavors of honeysuckle flowers, peaches, pineapples and vanilla cream, with a steely minerality that makes the finish bracing. Try as an alternative to Chardonnay.",11.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
23036,Kings Ridge 2006 Riesling (Oregon),"This Riesling is right on the borderline of dry/off-dry (just under 1% RS). The fruit, from cooler Willamette Valley vineyard sites, has been fermented in stainless steel and aged on its lees, yielding a wine that is thick, almost meaty. It's as sappy as a fresh peach, and finishes with crisp peach-skin phenolics. All-in-all this is a surprising wine, neither simple nor plain, but full-flavored in the comforting style that seems almost to have vanished from the Northwest.",14.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
23040,EOS 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Pair this dry, spicy wine with everything from roast chicken to hummus, or drink as a refreshing cocktail sipper. It's really interesting and fairly complex, providing a balance of citrus and fig flavors with a tangy minerality that seems to show off the wine's terroir.",14.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
23041,Bernardus 2006 Griva Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"Bernardus has been doing a great job with this bottling, while keeping the price affordable. It's an upscale, vibrant wine of great charm and elegance. Showing keen Arroyo Seco acidity, it offers a powerhouse punch of figs, dates, pineapples, Meyer lemons, honseysuckle and peppery spice.",20.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
23286,Snoqualmie 2006 Winemaker's Select Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With full ripeness, density and concentration, this keeps its superb balance at just 10.8% alcohol and 5% residual sugar. The dynamic tension plays out beautifully, and doesn't veer into any sort of sugary slackness. This has the sort of weight and complexity you would expect in a $30 wine.",8.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23289,Sbragia 2006 Home Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"I love this Sauvignon Blanc for its dryness and freshness, its acidity that cleanses the mouth so well, and its subtle complexity. The green grass, lime and ruby grapefruit flavors are enriched with dates, vanilla and candied ginger, while the long, spicy finish is just perfect.",20.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23293,Brander 2006 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Rich and layered, this wine expresses the essence of its vineyard's fruit. Smacks of tangy citrus, lime blossom, lemon curd, peach and yellow apricot flavors that flood the palate and finish long and spicy. It's a very big wine, but balanced and elegant.",25.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23296,Merry Cellars 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine carries a whiff of honeyed fig, which opens out into a luscious, rich, satisfying, full-bodied Sémillon. It's a complete wine, which seems to run through a lifetime's evolution in the mouth, finishing with a creamy, plush mix of fruit and barrel. Long, seamless and delicious.",18.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23318,Viento 2006 Columbia Gorge Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This is winemaker Rich Cushman's estate vineyard. At 25 years of age, it may well be the oldest Riesling planting in the region. The alcohol is just under 11%, but there is plenty of acid under the fruit, so despite its off-dry designation, this is a wine that would work wonderfully well with a wide variety of cheeses and appetizers. Flavors suggest pears and peaches, detailed with spice and stone.",14.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
23353,Lamborn Family Vineyards 2006 Serendipity Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"This high-octane wine will please lovers of big, powerful Zinfandel. It's a little hot from high alcohol, but so lush, you hardly notice. Offers waves of currants, anise and pepper that go on and on, and the finish is dry.",41.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
23369,Stephen & Walker 2006 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A bit too soft for complete balance, but there's no denying the delicious Zinny flavors. Floods the mouth with peppery, spicy wild blackberries, red currants, licorice and beef jerky, all wrapped into firm, dry tannins. Drink now.",39.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
23406,Patterson 2006 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, 100% varietal. Licorice, smoke and herbs race up the spine, rounded out with black fruits, fig, tobacco and coffee. Good grip and length.",32.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
23426,Matanzas Creek 2006 Merlot (Bennett Valley),"Ripe and voluptuous, with very rich, long-lasting berry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors, liberally oaked and wrapped into fine, sturdy tannins. Lacks a bit of complexity, but otherwise a beautiful Merlot that trades on the variety's opulently fleshy sensuality.",35.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
23810,Seven Hills 2006 Pentad Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Dark, bold, and full-bodied, this is the perfect embodiment of power and breed in a full-on (five grape) Bordeaux blend. Boysenberry, cassis, plenty of acidity—the nose promises a great deal, though it is reticent in the mouth, and fairly acidic. This is a wine to lay down and enjoy in a decade.",50.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
23815,Black Ridge 2006 San Andreas Red Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A beautiful Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, albeit a very young one that would be a shame to drink too early. The score indicates its current drinkability, but that could heighten over the next 6–8 years. Shows a very firm tannic structure, with luscious black currant flavors that grow richer as the wine warms up in the glass.",49.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23817,Bunnell 2006 Boushey-McPherson Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is always a topflight bottling, and winemaker Ron Bunnell gets the same rows and uses the same barrel regimen and winemaking methods. So what is different? Vintage variation. In 2006 the wines are tighter and slower to open, perhaps longer lived, and show less of the immediately seductive fruit flavors of 2005. Boushey-McPherson is naturally sharp and edgy when young anyway, and those characteristics are much in evidence here, so this is a wine to decant if you plan to drink it anytime soon.",42.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
23825,Novy 2006 Judge Family Vineyard Grenache (Bennett Valley),"Showing a huge improvement over the '06, Novy's '07 Grenache is rich in chocolaty blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, but beautifully structured. The firm tannins and crisp acids balance out the slightly sweet jammy flavors and lead to true elegance.",27.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
24080,Kana 2006 Dark Star Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is almost entirely Syrah, done in a high-acid, citrusy style. Flavors are sharply etched and tight—pomegranate, raspberry, baking chocolate and espresso. Straightforward and well-balanced despite its 15% alcohol.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
24172,Quivira 2006 Wine Creek Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"The flavors in this Zin are very lush and delicious, suggesting a mélange of crushed wild forest berries, freshly ground black peppercorn, mocha, anise and something animal, like sweet, soy-splashed grilled beef. The drawback is excessive softness, which may be related to high alcohol. The correct tannic structure isn't there.",34.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
24189,Amador Foothill Winery 2006 Esola Vineyad Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"It's bit harsh in texture and is minty, with wintergreen and pepper flavors that nudge into cherries and mocha. Good for barbecue and cheese plates.",20.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
24190,Kokomo 2006 Cuvée Béla Red (Sonoma County),"Made of the two Cabs plus Petite Sirah, this red is soft, sweet and simple. It has jammy blackberry and cherry flavors with a rich finish of milk chocolate and mint.",20.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
24192,Christian Lazo 2006 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A little sweet and direct in berry-flavored pie-filling, this Petite Sirah shows the variety's full-bodied texture and firm tannins. Brings to mind pizza, with sweet melted cheese.",25.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
24193,Pope Valley Winery 2006 Bella Rosa Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Shows cherry, raspberry and spice flavors that finish off-dry and rich in citrusy acids. Good with ham, sausage or pork in a fruit sauce.",10.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
24261,Reininger 2006 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Malbec is probably the most under-rated Washington red, but a wine such as this may change that. It's beautifully styled, tight in the midpalate, but with a broadly fruity entry that mixes berry and plum, cassis and chocolate, with a vein of mint. Winemaker Chuck Reininger has a masterful touch with tannins, and as with the rest of his reds, this is smooth and seductive, without harsh edges but with firmness and flesh. Young and primary, it looks to be a wine that can age for up to a decade.",45.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
24273,Jarvis 2006 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A very pretty wine, dry and delicious in cherry pie filling, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are just perfect, rich and soft, providing a velvety texture to the richness. Cabernet Sauvignon constitutes 11% of the blend, but the wine still shows that Cabernet Franc, by itself or almost nearly, needs something more to give it extra oomph.",65.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
24484,Hoyt Family Vineyards 2006 Syrah (California),"A good value for a red wine this smooth and flavorful. Shows deep, spicy flavors of blackberries, cherries and bacon, with a beautiful coating of tannin. The grapes come from the Malibu area and from the Santa Ynez Valley.",21.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
24571,A to Z 2006 Riesling (Oregon),"Tart and racy, this sets up the palate for spicy fare with bracing acids and scents of citrus skins. It is the first-ever Riesling for A to Z, a nod perhaps to the growing demand for these wines, especially on the West Coast. Flavors mix citrus, white flowers, strawberries and spice, with a finishing lick of minerality.",13.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
24582,A to Z 2006 Pinot Blanc (Oregon),"Lightly scented with melon, white peach and nectarines, this elegant Pinot Blanc has retained its bright acidity, wrapping it around the fresh, tangy fruit flavors. It is perfectly balanced and just slightly sweet, from fruit more than sugar. A lovely apéritif, it finishes lightly spicy with flavors of fresh cut pear.",13.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
24686,Bonterra 2006 Bartolucci Vineyard Muscat (Lake County),"This is a dessert wine, and a very pleasurable one. It's sweet but not too sweet, and very high acidity provides crisp balance to the pineapple, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors. The official sugar reading is 7.5%, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 9%. Great with a fruit tart, sorbet or Key lime pie.",16.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
24691,Kynsi 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Santa Maria Valley),"This is the fourth 90-point score this bottling has earned in as many years, meaning the wine has hit a very nice stride. Made with no oak, it offers a crisp, fruity freshness, with flavors of limes, tangerines, peaches, pears and vanilla.",22.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
24695,Thomas Fogarty 2006 Gewürztraminer (Monterey County),"The best Fogarty Gewürz ever. A blend of two well-known vineyards, Ventana and Scheid, it has the weight and racy acidity of a Sauvignon Blanc, but with the distinctive Asian spiciness of Gewürztraminer, along with nuances of rose petals, water chestnuts, pineapples and sweet green baby peas.",17.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25084,Spicerack 2006 Punchdown Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"With its black pepper, cassis, beef jerky and Provençal herb flavors, this Syrah offers rich, complex drinking at a fair price. Fully dry, its tannins are thick, but very finely ground. Shows class and elegance through the long, spicy finish.",25.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
25092,Carica 2006 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This lovely, single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc showcases bright, ripe fruit with crisp acidity, and manages to finish dry. It's creamy textured, packed with lemon, lime and pink grapefruit flavors, and richer notes of melons, figs, wild honey, vanilla and smoke.",21.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25106,Peterson 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a big, strong, exuberant Zindandel that shows Dry Creek's briary, brambly personality at its best. It's a dry, full-bodied, tannic wine, with flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Black pepper, star anise and cinnamon provide the exotic spices. It's quite a good, rich Zinfandel at a very good price.",22.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25113,Hestan 2006 Stephanie Red (Napa Valley),"Quite ripe, verging on overripe, showing flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with a very slight raisining on the finish. Shows good integration of oak and fruit, housed in firm tannins that are astringent in youth. Should develop bottle maturity for six years or so, at least.",60.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25115,Opus One 2006 Red (Napa Valley),"A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish. The vintage was not Opus One's best, but the wine is impeccably crafted, and shows its usual fine tannic structure.",195.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25154,Foxen 2006 Williamson-Doré Vineyard Cuvée Jeanne Marie Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rhône blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.",35.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
25159,Walla Walla Vintners 2006 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cab Franc is often chewy, tannic, herbal, but rarely luscious, as it is here. The addition of 12% Merlot softens up the middle, but the Franc is the show, with a dazzling display of blueberry, boysenberry, raspberry, coffee, tobacco leaf, lead pencil and more.",28.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
25182,Tercero 2006 Cuvée Christie Red (Santa Barbara County),"With an opening scent of freshly crushed raspberries and cherries sprinkled with black pepper and drizzled with anisette, this is an inviting wine. A Grenache-based Rhône blend, it turns soft and a little sweet and simple in the mouth, but is very easy to enjoy.",28.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
25261,Silvan Ridge 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This is a crisp, serviceable Pinot Gris, with sharp green-apple and cut pear fruit dominating. It's got plenty of acid underscoring the fruit, and should work well as an all-purpose wine.",15.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
25272,Erath 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Now part of the Ste. Michelle Wine Estates portfolio, this pioneering Oregon winery seems to be holding firm to a clean, simple style of winemaking, as exemplified by this fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris. Lemony and tart, it's the sort of pleasantly generic white wine that one might expect to find from Italy.",14.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
25274,Martin & Weyrich 2006 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),"This wine is a combo of Paso Robles and Edna Valley. The Paso fruit brings slightly cooked, jammy pear and apricot flavors, while the San Luis Obispo grapes provide balancing acidity and a keen lime edge. The result is dry and easy.",15.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
25371,Merriam 2006 Windacre Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A bruiser of a Merlot, dry and muscular, with green olive, blackberry, sage and smoky cedar flavors, wrapped into bigtime tannins. Even at the age of nearly 5 it's still brooding and hard. Not an ager, but there's something fine and polished about it now.",30.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
25388,Ursa 2006 Old Vines Reserve Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Too soft by far, with sugary sweet, medicinal cherry-berry flavors and a sharp cut of acidity. Tastes like an inexpensive Port.",30.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
25483,Sheldrake Point 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"This Cabernet Franc has a slightly watery, sweet fruit element that lacks the cheerful vibrancy and pluckiness of the variety. On the nose, it offers soft red fruit and some spice, but the flavors feel weak. Not a bad wine overall, but needs some muscle.",17.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
25500,French Hill 2006 Grand Reserve Petit Verdot (California),"Port-like, with raisiny, baked cherry and caramel flavors. Finishes dry.",40.0,80,3,0.9523485422044722
25512,Rivino 2006 Sedulous Red (Mendocino),"Honey-sweet and simple, with crisp, jammy flavors of berries, cherries and cocoa. It's a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Viognier.",28.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
25515,Jalama 2006 El Capitan Red (Santa Barbara County),"Not quite ripe, with an herbal, almost vegetal taste that cuts across the cherries and red currants. Acidic and tannic, too. This hard, austere wine is unlikely to improve.",30.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
25521,Vivác Winery 2006 Divino Red (New Mexico),"Spiced meats, cherry and pepper give this plucky red a food-friendly edge. On the palate, it's spicy and slightly tart, with cranberry, blueberry and crushed herbs. Earthy and dry, the wine will pair well with spiced meat and pastas.",27.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
25526,Mosby 2006 Teroldego (Santa Barbara County),"Strongly flavored and rustic in the mouth, with harsh, not quite ripe tannins framing jammy flavors of cherries, coffee and spice. This tough wine needs rich, oily meats and cheeses to balance it.",30.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
25529,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Chenin Blanc Ice Wine White (Horse Heaven Hills),"A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary.",45.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25533,Easton 2006 Zinfandel (Amador County),"Easton's basic Zin offers plenty of delicious pleasure. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, packed with wild blackberry, mulberry, mocha and (believe it or not) ollallieberry flavors, which perhaps suggests a certain rural, old-fashioned quality. The wine is also superspicy in white pepper and nutmeg. Great value.",15.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25543,Vision Cellars 2006 Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"When California Riesling succeeds, it's because of wines like this, which hails from a well-farmed, cool-climate region. The two most important varietal elements, racy acidity and subtle flavor, both are here. The latter suggest peaches, Meyer lemons and wildflowers, with a rich undertow of stony minerals, and the finish is wonderfully bone dry. What a great restaurant wine.",18.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
25548,MacMurray Ranch 2006 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),"Succulent and crisp; those two words are what you want in a California Pinot Gris, and you get them here. The pear, pineapple, peach and fig flavors are balanced with refreshing acidity, while a touch of oak and sur lie aging adds accents of smoke and creamy vanilla.",20.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
26336,Kunde 2006 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness. The flavors offer a blast of peppery, briary wild red, black and blue berries and currants, with vibrant hints of bacon, cola and sandalwood. Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
26485,Cor Cellars 2006 Columbia View Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"This sharp, spicy, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc showcases the flavors of the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's a pungent wine, with sweet grassy flavors and a hint of toast, despite fermentation in stainless steel. Unusual but interesting.",14.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
26497,Francis Berwyn 2006 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Not particularly Petite Sirah-like, because it's not a big, huge, tannic wine that needs a long time to come around. But it is a marvelously good red for drinking now at a fair price. Drily tannic and polished, it has deep flavors of fresh, crushed ripe blackberries and cherries, with a delicious edge of pepper and chocolate.",13.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
26794,Von Strasser 2006 Petit Verdot Port (Diamond Mountain District),"Sweet in chocolate-covered cherries and crème de cassis, but turns a bit thin on the finish, and could use greater concentration, especially at this price.",75.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
26808,Martin Ranch 2006 Thérèse Vineyards Lester Family Vineyards Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rich and ripe in juicy blackberries, currants and cedar, with thick tannins. But there's a sharp acidity that kicks in immediately and detracts from the mouthfeel. Drink now.",35.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
26811,Medusa 2006 Pig Pen Vineyard Deaver Ranch Zinfandel (Amador County),"Nice and dry, with black currant, orange rind, anise, tobacco, cocoa and spice flavors. But the wine lacks vivacity and zest, and so loses a few points.",20.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
27048,Twomey 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Pretty good Merlot for its dryness and classy mouthfeel. Shows blackberry, cherry, herb and oak flavors, with solid tannins. Beginning to dry out, so drink now.",50.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
27055,Monticello Vineyards 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"A perfectly fine, full-bodied red wine. Dry and tannic, it has ripe cherry and some overripe raisin and prune notes, wrapped into fancy tannins. Drink now.",34.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722

27223,Bota Box 2006 Merlot (California),"At the equivalent of $4.50 per regular bottle, this Merlot is a pretty good buy. It's a little rough and peppery, but the dryness helps, and so does the hint of cherry-berry fruit.",18.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
27224,Concannon 2006 Selected Vineyards Merlot (Central Coast),"With 10% Petite Sirah, this dark, full-bodied wine is overtly sweet and rustic. It's made in a popular style meant to wash down ribs, pork and chicken dripping with barbecue sauce.",12.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
27376,Hendry 2006 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"There's a lot of funkiness in this wine, which smells like sweaty leather. The flavors are deep and spicy, and the tannins are rich and fine, but that funkiness is a turnoff.",38.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
27661,Vino Con Brio 2006 Brilliant White Wine White (Lodi),"A blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio, this unoaked wine has complex citrus fruit, vanilla bean, wildflower and spice flavors, brightened by a brisk scour of acidity. It's actually better than many Lodi whites made from the individual varieties, showing the importance of the art of blending.",16.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
27767,Castoro Cellars 2006 Muscat Canelli (Paso Robles),"Here's a nice dessert sipper that's perfect for nights on the patio, with some fresh fruit or a simple butter cookie. It's sweet and clean in acids, with savory Asian pear, tangerine, vanilla and cinnamon flavors. With only 11.5% alcohol, it won't go to your head.",9.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
27777,Orchid Hill 2006 Muscat Canelli (Paso Robles),"Shows classic Muscat flavors of oranges and tangerines, with a wildflowery taste suggesting buttercups and honeysuckles. This unoaked wine is basically dry, maybe tending toward off-dry. It has a touch of sweet honey, balanced with crisp acidity, and is very enjoyable by itself.",24.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
27894,Mumm Napa 2006 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Napa Valley),"Made from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Gris, this lovely Blanc de Blancs brims with vanilla cream, lime and pear aromas and flavors, with the yeasty, baked bread dough toastiness that mark the best sparkling wines. It's basically dry and quite high in acidity, which gives it a brisk, clean finish. Drink this fine bubbly now and for the next 6–8 years.",30.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
27972,Dusted Valley 2006 Viognier (Yakima Valley),"Aromatic and highly textural. The wine brings out a lot of citrus rind, tart stone fruits, and leesy texture. There's plenty of acid and hints of an underlying minerality with no hot alcohol burn. Just a little hint of stem in the tannins.",20.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
27973,Gorman 2006 Zachary's Ladder Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2006 Zachary's Ladder is 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Beautifully defined, sharp and tight. Still compact, dense, hard and young, but loaded with mixed flavors of black cherry, iron and rock. The tannins are tough and hard, the wine is firm and focused.",29.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
27985,JR Wine 2006 The Devious Woman Red (Napa Valley),"This interesting blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Cabernet Franc is a big wine packed with powerful black currant and licorice flavors, with a liberal dusting of pepper. It impresses for dryness and the rich, sturdy tannins. Drink this rustically chic wine with roasts.",32.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
28039,Lachini 2006 Il Mulinello Klipsun Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds.",49.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
28166,Flora Springs 2006 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),"Tough in tannins and dustily dry, this is a hard wine to warm up to. It's not just the astringency but the absence of fruit. Shows modest flavors of cherries and blackberries, and doesn't seem like an ager. A disappointment.",65.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28169,Joullian 2006 Cabernet Franc (Carmel Valley),"Dry and withered, with green, minty tartness. Offers hints of red cherries, although oak adds sweeter notes of vanilla and smoke.",35.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28170,Mount Tamalpais 2006 Merlot (Marin County),"The dryness and earthiness of this Merlot are just fine. It suggests flavors of herbs, tobacco and leather, in addition to cherries. But it's a bit too coarse and unstructured to get a higher score.",28.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28179,Blackbird Vineyards 2006 Arise Red (Napa Valley),"Made from 100% Merlot, this is a sort of junior, less expensive version of Blackbird's Illustration bottling. It's ripe in cherries and forward in smoky oak, with charred wood dominating the fruit. Feels simple and candy sweet in the mouth.",50.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28350,Pedroncelli 2006 Alto Vineyards Sangiovese (Dry Creek Valley),"They packed a little Cabernet Franc and Merlot into this Sangiovese to give it richness, with rewarding results. It's quite a good wine, dry and tart in mouthwatering acidity, with solid tannins framing accessible flavors of cherries, cola, leather and cedar. A commendable effort at a fair price.",14.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
28413,Peter Franus 2006 Brandlin Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),"The winery struggled last year with this bottling, but has made good progress with this dry, richly balanced 2006. It's an easy wine to drink now, medium-bodied and silky, with lush flavors of black currants, chocolate, licorice and cedar.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
28415,Sean Minor 2006 4B Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich is the word for this Merlot. It flatters the palate with jammy black cherries, red currants, anise, cocoa and violets, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Turns a bit one-dimensional, but offers plenty of flavor.",17.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
28420,Eric Kent 2006 Kalen's Big Boy Blend Syrah (Sonoma County),"Lusty and voluptuous are two words that describe this bone-dry Syrah. Heat from high alcohol accentuates the black currant, raisin and pepper flavors, and thick, rich tannins make it a full-bodied partner for beef. Could develop with two years in the bottle.",42.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
28518,Balletto 2006 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different.",14.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
28520,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2006 Viognier (Amador County),"Folks who like their white wines on the sugary side will appreciate this soft Viognier. It's tremendously rich in pineapple, pear, vanilla and marzipan flavors, almost like a dessert confection.",24.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
28528,Dashe Cellars 2006 Late Harvest Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Semi-sweet, this wine combines cherry and chocolate flavors with a vegetal, asparagus taste that detracts from the pleasures a dessert wine ought to bring.",24.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28530,Trinitas 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This wine has rich Meyer lemon, lime, fig, date, green apple and spice flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity. But the sugary finish is too sweet.",17.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
28619,Duckhorn 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),"Classic Duckhorn, which is to say, dry, tannic, elegantly structured and expensive. The winemaker succeeded, in this so-so year, in crafting a rich, nuanced wine of considerable interest. It may not be a longterm ager, but it's delicious now, with deep flavors of blackberries, red currants, violets, cocoa and smoky oak, balanced with the prettiest acidity. Grows better in the glass as it breathes.",85.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
28620,Ehret 2006 Bella's Blend Red (Knights Valley),"A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",39.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
28876,Joseph Phelps 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),"Phelps is, of course, a red wine house, but they do a credible job with Sauvignon Blanc. The ‘06 is stylish and balanced, and while it's not especially complex, it offers up a crisp mouthful of citrus, fig, melon, spice and oak flavors.",32.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
29077,Sunstone 2006 Rapsodie Du Soleil Red (Santa Barbara County),"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency. Airing coaxes out some modest cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and leather flavors, but it will always remain a tough, harsh wine.",45.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29081,Bianchi 2006 Plummer Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Dry and fiercely tannic, this Petite Sirah's rustic nature shows in the astringency and uneven ripeness of flavors. Shows a spectrum of blackberries, raisins and wintergreen. Drink now.",26.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29093,Millésimé 2006 Le Reflexion Syrah-Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley),"Clean and dry, but unbalanced, with raisin skin tannins that make the wine feel harsh and astringent. The addition of Viognier to the Syrah adds citrusy acids to the black currants. Needs greater richness.",55.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29168,Sunstone 2006 Syrah Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),"Just 6% Viognier makes all the difference in this Syrah-based blush. It adds a crisp, cutting edge of acidity and a lemony, wildflower brightness to the cherries and red currants the Syrah brings. Then there are the roses, lavender, tangerine zest and pepper that make this unoaked wine even more complex.",26.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
29181,Brassfield 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (High Valley),"Brassfield's Sauvignon Blanc is proving to be a good investment in a modestly priced, dry white wine of that variety. With a dash of Sémillon for richness, the wine is crisply acidic, with rich flavors of pineapples, honeysuckle, green apples, green melons and figs.",16.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
29360,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",30.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
29361,Tamarack Cellars 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has black cherry fruit flavor in spades, along with blueberry and sweet blackberry. It's smooth to the point of softness, with fully ripe tannins and a sweet but firm finish with chocolate, cherries and coffee grounds.",28.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
29388,Buty 2006 Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming.",25.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
29436,Francis Berwyn 2006 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This savory Zin screams its varietal identity with a blast of pepper, nutmeg and clove that accompanies ripe blackberries, wild cherries, mulberries and smoky oak. The wine feels very soft and lightly elegant in the mouth, but fully dry. Perfect for restaurant wine lists.",13.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
29454,Eric Kent 2006 Dry Stack Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Kind of tough in texture, with hard tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. The question is, will it age? Maybe for a little while, but it's always going to have that rough edge to the blackberries, currants, pepper and cedar.",40.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
29609,Olabisi 2006 King Vineyard Syrah (Suisun Valley),"Time has not tamed this in-your-face, oaky, high-octane Syrah, which on the label says it's also known as “rasta red.” The wine is very tannic, smelling of earth and tar and sticky caramel and could use a touch more fruitiness to give it a lift. Do not attempt to drink without a sauce-slathered side of beef.",30.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29736,Dominio IV 2006 Tango Estate Reserve Tempranillo (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Coming from four different Tempranillo clones planted at the winery's estate vineyard, it beguiles with notes of saddle leather, dried cherry, dusky spices and citrus spritz. The fruit flavors are polished and the tannins structured—a thoroughly delightful bottle.",42.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
29780,Truchard 2006 Roussanne (Carneros),"Powerful in wildflower-accented white and yellow fruits that have a baked, pie-filling flavor, this Roussanne has the weight and creamy texture of a Chardonnay. It turns spicy and a little tart on the finish, making it a disappointment after the fine 2005.",20.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
29784,Navarro 2006 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"With 11.1% residual sugar, this is a sweet wine, but it's also a little simple. That brown sugar and honey sweetness is delicious, by definition, but the underlying flavors are a little disappointing.",19.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
29796,Hopkins Vineyard 2006 Duet White (Western Connecticut Highlands),"This Connecticut white starts out with a successful combination of yeasty baked vanilla aromas paired with some lemon citrus, then leads into clean, light flavors buoyed by a lively acidity. Refreshing and easy to drink, and priced fairly, this wine will pair well with broiled and grilled seafood dishes.",11.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29802,Sonoma Creek 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"A textbook example of the modern, New World-style of red winemaking, this Merlot is as soft as melted butter, extraordinarily ripe and slightly sweet in the finish. The flavors are of vanilla-infused cherries, red currants and chocolate.",13.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
29820,Kynsi 2006 ZB Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Disappointing, especially from this winery and vineyard, at this price. It's high in acidity and tough in tannins, and oak just adds a caramelized sweetness to the jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. This Syrah isn't going anywhere, so drink up.",46.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
30124,Brian Carter Cellars 2006 Solesce Red (Yakima Valley),"The extra time has helped to unwrap what must have been an exceedingly compact wine, but it still needs to be decanted and/or cellared further. The black fruits are subservient to the dense, tarry tannins. Everything is ripe, but ripe as fine Bordeaux is ripe, with earth and bark and herb still prominent.",50.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
30238,O'Reilly's 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"O'Reilly's is the budget label for Owen Roe, featuring an attentive wolfhound on the label. Crisp and bracing, this is loaded with textured pear and apple fruit, flavors of barrel fermentation and wonderful pearskin highlights.",13.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
30416,Adelaida 2006 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A rich, savory Zin that shows the softness and warmth of Paso Robles, with an exotic array of fruit and spice flavors. Waves of blackberries, cherries, mulberries, chocolate, licorice and peppery spices mingle into a long, interesting finish. Drink now through 2010 for youthful zest.",26.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
30553,Gia Domella 2006 E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Hot in alcohol and sweet in ripe fruit and glycerine. Shows jammy flavors of raspberries, blackberries, cherries and chocolate, along with Zinfandel's peppery spices. Drink now.",26.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
30759,White Oak 2006 Syrah (Napa Valley),"A big, dry, immature wine, firm in acids and tannins, whose strong black pepper notes add to its tart pungency. Underneath all that are immaculate blackberry and roasted meat flavors. Impressive for the price, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",26.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
30802,Michael Florentino Cellars 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Syrah is still finding its way in Washington, and a certain sameness affects many of these wines. This tastes like the product of relatively young vines; spicy, leafy and lightly peppery, with tart cranberry and raspberry fruit, it's balanced and similar to a lighter Zin from the Dry Creek Valley; tasty and fresh, without over-reaching.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30807,Brian Carter Cellars 2006 Abracadabra Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sappy, tannic and loaded with plum and blueberry, some cassis and chocolate. A good follow-up to the previous vintage, with very dark fruit, polished tannins and a lengthy, tasty finish of chocolate-covered cherries.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30811,Peachy Canyon 2006 Especial Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Full-bodied and robust, with explosive flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, dates, chocolate, Tabasco and crushed red and black peppercorn. With a hint of sweetness, it will play well against grilled lamb, chicken or beef with barbecue sauce.",40.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30812,Peachy Canyon 2006 Snow Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Super-peppery, this full-bodied Zin also has grilled blackberry and plum, mocha, licorice, beef jerky and gingersnap cookie flavors. The rich tannins call for grilled steaks and chops.",36.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30813,Pope Valley Winery 2006 Eakle Ranch Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Marked by dryness and rich acidity, this light- to medium-bodied Sangiovese has ripe flavors of red cherries and orange rind, with a tarry, asphalt or pine cone smoky spiciness. Good with steak and lamb chops. Drink now.",18.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30814,Ravenswood 2006 Old Hill Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Made in the style of an old field blend, this Zin is at least 75% varietal, but the balance could be anything among 14 other grapes. The wine is tannic, peppery and rich in currant and chocolate flavors, with high alcohol. Seems a pace or two behind more recent vintages.",60.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
30849,Morse 2006 Ensemble G-S-M (Sierra Foothills),"Not much going on except sweet, toasty oak-like aromas and flavors, with lots of hard, dry tannins. There's a splash of cherries and plums.",20.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
30879,Spell Wine 2006 Spellonu Red Red (Napa Valley),"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a sweet, rustic wine. It's overripe and Porty, with caramel, blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.",15.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
31175,Cinnabar 2006 Trebbiano (Paso Robles),"Trebbiano is a workhorse Italian variety that will never achieve noble status, like Chardonnay, but in the right hands can be the perfect dry white wine. Cinnabar has done a great job. The wine is crisp and floral, with citrus, honeysuckle and spice flavors lightly touched by oak. Try with tempura dipped in soy sauce.",25.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
31180,Wilson 2006 Carl's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Soft and melted in the mouth, with jammy flavors of ripe mashed cherries and raspberries, drizzled with milk chocolate and anisette, and finished with a sprinkle of tangerine zest and black pepper.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
31283,Lachini 2006 Il Mulinello Klipsun Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds.",49.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
31310,Wente 2006 Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley),"This stainless-steel fermented Sauvignon bursts with plenty of grassy, herbal notes as well as tropical and citrus fruit before ending with a hint of grapefruit pith.",14.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
31320,Northwest Totem Cellars 2006 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Chandler Reach grew the grapes for this big, chewy, rather blocky Merlot. It offers pleasant red fruits and light chocolaty barrel notes.",33.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
31802,Matanzas Creek 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke.",24.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
32222,Mannina Cellars 2006 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is soft and round with pleasing flavors of black cherry and plum. Hints of coffee and chocolate do not tamper with the basic core of clean, ripe fruit. It's quite nicely made, drinking well, and comes into focus in the extended finish.",24.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
32370,Venteux 2006 Raucous Red (Paso Robles),"This Bordeaux-Rhône blend is quite soft and lush. It has chocolaty flavors of mashed ripe blackberries, currants, plum jelly and black pepper, wrapped into exceedingly finely ground tannins. Drink now.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
32381,Sausal 2006 Century Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Dry and intricate, with Zinny flavors of wild raspberries, nettles, thyme and pepper. Yet there are some overripe notes of raisins that give this dry wine a Porty taste.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
32386,Robert Karl 2006 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"McKinley Springs vineyard has provided the grapes, and Joe Gunselman has crafted a spicy, forward and aromatic Syrah, co-fermenting it with 5% Viognier. The light fruit flavors of raspberry and pie cherry—remain clear and fresh through the mid-palate, but fail to add to that slender strength in the finish. In fact, the wine turns a bit chalky, and feels prematurely dried out, without the complexity that made the glorious 2005 so memorable.",30.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
32450,Fenestra 2006 White Riesling (Arroyo Seco),"This stone-soil, cool-climate region of Monterey is the perfect place to grow a German-style Riesling and keep the price down, because costs there aren't as high as in the North and South coasts. The wine is brilliantly crisp and off-dry, with savory honeysuckle, citrus, apple and mineral flavors, with even richer suggestions of tropical fruits.",13.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
32452,Phelps Creek 2006 Celilo Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"The Celilo vineyard, located on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge appellation, is one of the most unique in the region. This ripe, almost liquorous Merlot is bursting with sappy cherry fruit, buttressed with tangy acids. The structure is here to more than support the weight of the wine and its alcohol, just under 15%. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla dominate the finish.",24.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
32456,Stella Fino 2006 Pinot Gris (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The label shows a pretty graphic of a young woman in flapper attire—the actual Stella Fino. Clean, fresh and true to varietey, with appealing melon and apple flavors, this displays confident winemaking with an elegant touch.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
32796,Duende 2006 Lewis Vineyard Tempranillo (Clements Hills),"From one of the new sub-AVAs in the big Lodi appellation comes this Tempranillo. It's soft in both acids and tannins and rather sweet, with cherry jam, cola, violet flower and vanilla flavors.",12.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
32800,Domaine Alfred 2006 Margarita Vineyards Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),"Simple and slightly sweet, this Central Coast Syrah has blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, Dr. Pepper and fig flavors. It's easy to drink, and finishes soft and spicy.",18.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
32837,Troon 2006 Steelhead Run Vineyard Viognier (Applegate Valley),"This aromatic wine has a strong floral scent that opens into more typical notes of tart lime skin and pineapple. It continues with similar palate impressions, then leaves a somewhat oily aftertaste, like a swallow of perfume.",22.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
32838,Little Black Dress 2006 Pinot Grigio (California),"A very nice wine, and more proof, if it's needed, that PG can make a crisp, interesting dry white even at an everyday price. Acidity is high and clean, giving a vibrancy to the citrus, honeysuckle, mineral and vanilla flavors.",10.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
33385,Northstar 2006 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Certainly one of the finest Merlots ever made by Northstar, this is notable for the floral and citrus high notes, over cherry and cassis. There's coconut, chocolate and coffee, tar and tobacco also—a full throttle, seductive wine.",50.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
33461,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Viognier (Washington),"This is 100% Viognier, different from the winery's varietally labeled version in that it is 100% stainless-steel fermented. The result is a less round and toasty wine, but one that, in this vintage at least, offers more focus and precision. Peach and apricot, tangerine and tropical fruits are on display, and the finish winds down gently, with none of the heat or bitterness that can affect some Viogniers.",18.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
33464,Cascadia 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bright and crisp with clean, fresh flavors of apple and pear. It's got some pretty honeysuckle in both the nose and the mouth, and the overall texture, balance and length puts it in with some of Washington's best.",16.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
33602,Six Sigma Ranch 2006 Michael's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Lots of new French oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring went into the making of this wine, and it shows the yeasty richness and creamy texture of that expensive handling. Yet the underlying wine is just very good. It has very bright acidity, with slightly sweet flavors of spearmint chewing gum, lemons and limes.",28.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
33610,Vixen 2006 V Cuvée White (Santa Barbara County),"This is a white Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne, and it shows exuberant fruit and a nice, spicy richness. The flavors of apricots, pears and pineapples have a caramelized, honeyed finish.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
33636,Treana 2006 Mer Soleil Vineyard White (Central Coast),"Treana has enjoyed great success with this blend of Viognier and Marsanne, which is one of the best Rhône-style white wines in California. The main reason is the source of the grapes. The vineyard, owned by the Wagners of Caymus, is stellar. The '06 is as rich and crisply acidic as ever, with fantastically complex, honeyed tropical fruit, apricot and floral flavors that taste like they have a touch of botrytis.",25.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
33648,Andrew Rich 2006 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A deftly made wine, this exceptional Roussanne blends fruit into a creamy, luscious blend of tropical fruits, apricots, whole cream, nutmeg and more. There is so much fruit that it's easy to overlook the crisp acid underpinning, the nice details of baking spices and the exceptional strength through the lingering finish.",20.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
33740,Angeline 2006 Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A very nice Merlot whose smooth texture and sophisticated flavors make it a bargain at this price. Ready to drink now, it has flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and mint, enriched with a subtle coating of smoky oak.",14.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
33802,Halleck 2006 Piner Creek Ranch Dry Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley),"The options for fine, really dry California Gewürz are surprisingly limited, which is too bad, because a good one, like Halleck's '06, is hard to beat. Racy and crisp in acidity, it's bright in flavor, offering waves of peaches, apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, figs, vanilla and the complex Asian spices from which the variety takes its name.",30.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
33824,A to Z 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This excellent Pinot Gris offers a rich mix of ripe citrus and tropical fruits, acacia flowers, honeysuckle and a hint of buttered toffee. It's rich and full-bodied without being tiring or flabby, with excellent length and structure. Almost 24,000 cases were produced.",13.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
33862,Castello di Borghese 2006 Meritage Red Table Wine Meritage (North Fork of Long Island),"Whiffs of freshly cut mint and tarragon are pleasant against a backdrop of lean red fruit on the nose and palate of this Bordeaux blend, but lurking traces of underripe fruit and tomato leaf distract.",60.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
33960,Envy 2006 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Tastes classically young and in need of cellaring, with gigantic, dry tannins and a fresh-fruit directness that hasn't meshed yet with the oak barrel influences. Give it until at least 2012, and it should hold for years after.",45.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
34459,Tablas Creek 2006 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Soft, sweet and chocolaty, with gooey raspberry, cherry and currant flavors. Decadently good in its own way, but kind of candy simple in its appeal. Ready now.",35.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
34476,Amity 2006 Wedding Dance Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Off-dry and fruity, this lively Riesling is notable for its strong honeysuckle scent and the follow-up flavors of lemon and honey.

35622,Parkmon 2006 Marsha's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),"There's lots of exotic Viognier character packed into this fruity, slightly sweet wine.

35738,Dos Cabezas 2006 Viognier (Cochise County),Honey and toasted spice aromas are followed by an elegant balance of curvy fruit and acid in this stylish Viognier from Arizona.

35767,Trio Vintners 2006 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's quite different from the winery's inaugural 2005 Sangiovese, with more sweet cranberry fruit and chewy, peppery tannins. It's got both muscle and spice, with a sweet, cotton candy core that is buttressed with the power of   the lengthy finish that adds layers of fat and cocoa.",20.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
35902,Bianchi 2006 Heritage Selection Syrah (Paso Robles),"Quite a good wine, rich, full-bodied and succulent. Shows a wealth of blackberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and black pepper flavors that finish with a touch of heat.

35905,Exuberance 2006 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"A little soft, but delicious and complex. It has waves of raspberry, cherry, sweet cola, red licorice and oaky cedar flavors, with a spicy edge of smoked meat, like cured salumi.

36401,DaMa 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is yet another Washington Riesling that shows how good these wines can be. This is well beyond the sweet and fruity style of the tasting room wines; here are layers of stone fruits, density and weight, length and detail. Once in the mouth this explodes with flavor and keeps bringing the oranges, peaches, apricots, nectarines and apples to the table.",16.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
36415,Stuart Cellars 2006 Long Valley Red Limited Estate Reserve Meritage (Temecula Valley),"A tough, common wine, gritty in tannins, with superripe blackberry flavors that veer into bitter raisinskins and dark, unsweetened baker's chocolate. Not going anywhere.",50.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
36544,Bonterra 2006 Syrah (Mendocino County),"Extraordinarily rich in briary flavors of wild blackberries, licorice, cocoa and pepper, this Syrah has the added virtue of finishing dry. Although it's a bit soft, it's a beauty, especially at this price.",15.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722

37191,Novelty Hill 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Novelty Hill's vineyard-designated Syrah is bigger, darker and more aromatically complex than the companion Columbia Valley bottling. Cassis and blackberry fruit flavors are layered with chocolate and spice; immaculately clean, this does not display the earthy/meaty aspect of Syrah, but does have a pleasing minerality at the core.",28.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
37194,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Washington),"The structure of this Syrah, from a vineyard in the Royal Slope, is impressive. It's a balanced blend of flavors, with juicy raspberry and blackberry fruit, black olive, pepper and spice.",36.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
37384,Dolce 2006 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.",85.0,98,3,0.9523485422044722
37409,Kenefick Ranch 2006 Pickett Road Red Red (Calistoga),"Young, intense and briary, with summer herb notes of anise framing ripe, spicy blackberries. Oak adds a rich, deft touch of sweet char. The tannins are considerable and brooding, giving this dry young wine an astringent tightness. Shows all the hallmarks of ageability. 45% Merlot, 43% Petit Verdot 7% Cabernet Franc, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon.",55.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
37500,Tres Sabores 2006 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Typical of a young, fine Petite Sirah, this bottle is too tannic and unintegrated to drink now. But it has a gigantic heart of blackberries, currants, chocolate, anise, leather and cedar, and should have no problem developing in the bottle over the next decade. Hold until after 2011.",45.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
37630,Jacuzzi 2006 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Bone dry, tart in acidity and silky in texture, with flavors of mashed red cherries and red currants. Pretty austere by itself, but better with cheeses, roasts, olive oil.",18.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
38019,Vivác Winery 2006 Tempranillo (New Mexico),"An alluring nose of plum, leather and spice leads on this red, and on the palate, structured, big fruit flavors follow. It's jammy but has grip, and though slightly one dimensional, the wine has character. A good showing.",20.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
38021,VJB 2006 Baci di Famiglia Chardonnay Port (Sonoma Valley),"Chardonnay Port? It's nothing remotely like anything that ever came out of Portugal, but it is sweet and crisp in tangerine, peach, vanilla and honey flavors.",28.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
38029,Sheldrake Point 2006 Barrel Reserve Merlot (Finger Lakes),"This wine hits all the right notes—gamy spice, a touch of minerality, savory, rich fruit. A touch of oak adds muscle and the overall package is satisfying.",24.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
38036,Stubbs Vineyard 2006 Merlot (Marin County),"This Merlot remains tight, tannic and acidic. Give it credit for elegant structure, but despite some good cherry fruit, it's still a dour wine.",38.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722

38315,Pezzi King 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and delicious, with sweet oak-inspired flavors of red berries, cola, leather and dusty Indian spices. Could be crisper in acidity, but it's a fine, briary Zinfandel to drink now.",22.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722

38508,Lakewood 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Lakewood hits the mark with this affordable Cabernet Franc. Earthy, attractive aromas of spice and pepper unfold into flavors of raspberry, cherry and more pepper. The wine has depth and weight without being heavy, thanks to a decent amount of acid. The finish is slightly weak but overall, a good wine and friendly.",16.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
38518,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2006 Bear & Lion Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A rich, lusty Zin, filled with wild berry and spice flavors, with a touch of raisins. No surprise that it's a little prickly hot, because the alcohol is way high, but that's just fine with barbecue.",26.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
38522,Alta Maria 2006 Uriel J. Nielson Vineyard Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),"A promising Grenache. Shows tremendous cherry flavors wrapped into elegantly smooth tannins, and the finish is dry and spicy. Pretty good, but a little fruit-driven and one-dimensional. The next step is to build in extra layers of complexity and depth.",60.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
38584,Novy 2006 Oley Dessert Wine Viognier (Russian River Valley),"This is a very sweet, unctuous dessert wine, with the flavor and texture of honey.

38592,Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",17.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
39284,McCrea Cellars 2006 Cuvée Orleans Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Broadly fruity at first, this turns a little loose-knit, like a Grateful Dead jam. It's compelling but not terribly tight; it meanders into leaf and tea, then chocolate, then back to the light and pretty red fruits.",40.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
39354,Vivác Winery 2006 V. by Vivác Single Vineyard Merlot (New Mexico),"This single-vineyard Merlot smells sweetly of ripe black plums with just a whisper of menthol and Band Aid. Soft on the palate, there's a good amount of dark fruit, but it's a tad tired and dusty. The finish is strong with a high-toned acidity and firm tannins.",25.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
39357,Wölffer 2006 Brut Blanc de Blanc Sparkling (Long Island),"This vividly effervescent sparkling Chardonnay offers notes of bruised apples and pears on the nose and a palate of rustic apple cider and lime pith flavors. A bright, lemony acidity makes this a refreshing, easy-drinking sparkler that would match perfectly with pork in a braised apple sauce.",35.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
39438,Cadence 2006 Cara Mia Vineyard Camerata Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"This is the first release from Cadence's estate vineyard, a 94/6 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Sharp and intense, the nose brings out tightly wound red fruit scents, annotated with leaf and white pepper. In this inaugural vintage the Cabernet Sauvignon clearly dominates. A supple, muscular, focused wine with the structure to develop nicely for up to a decade.",55.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
39594,Langtry 2006 Tephra Ridge Vineyard Merlot (Lake County),"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard.

39932,MacRostie 2006 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries. But there are also exotic and delicious notes of bacon, mocha and cola with a blast of black pepper throughout. The wine is full-bodied and dense in tannins, impressive from start to finish. Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",34.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722

40012,Robert Mondavi 2006 Private Selection Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A little simple in citrus flavor, but for the price, a pretty nice wine.

40240,Claiborne & Churchill 2006 Dry Gewürztraminer (Central Coast),"The winery makes one of the most consistent and food-friendly Gewürztraminers in the state, and the 2006 continues that tradition.

40296,Waters Crest 2006 Campania Rosso Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This red has a fruity, jammy nose with a peppery kick. On the palate it's a mixture of spicebox, cherry, coffee and pepper. Approachable and well made—a good everyday drinking red.",30.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
40322,Waters 2006 Forgotten Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"From 10-year-old vines at a vineyard in the foothills of the Blue Mountains east of town, this is a lush and loamy Syrah, smelling and tasting of moist earth, game and blood. There are some roasted tomato flavors along with light red fruits, but this is no wimpy wine; in fact, it gathers strength and concentration as it sits in the mouth, suggesting that it needs more years in the bottle to fully emerge from its shell.",40.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
40366,Niner 2006 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles),"This has been an interesting wine from Niner. Last year's bottling was terrific. So's this 2006. At the ripe old age of five, it's still firm in tannins and even has a cut of acidity that gives the blackberry and blueberry fruit a bite. Tastes fresh and lively, and could improve with 5–6 years in the bottle.",58.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
40402,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 The Mariner Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",40.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
40418,Hunnicutt 2006 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A very good Zinfandel, rich and complex. Shows the balanced elegance of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the peppery, wild berry, leather, cola and anise flavors are pure Zinfandel. Contains a few splashes of Petite Sirah.",34.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
40744,Dunham 2006 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 100% single vineyard Merlot; broad, beautifully integrated, with seamless black fruits, streaks of coffee and smoke, and black pepper spice.

40752,Basel Cellars 2006 Pheasant Run Vineyard Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's 100% Merlot, and it doesn't need any help from any other grapes. Extremely dark and thick in the mouth, this liquorous bruiser of a Merlot is thoroughly delicious. It's just packed with fruit, cassis and ripe black cherries, complemented by dark chocolate notes.",28.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
40763,JC Cellars 2006 Rockpile Vineyard Haley Syrah (Rockpile),"Soft and sweet in fruity extract and glycerols, and very high in alcohol, this Syrah is almost a dessert wine. There's no denying the flavors of blackberries, currants, sweet oak and chocolate are impressive, yet the wine needs greater dryness and structure.",60.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
40895,Buty 2006 Columbia Rediviva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah.

Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more.",48.0,96,3,0.9523485422044722
40913,BOND 2006 Pluribus Red (Napa Valley),"Very dark, dramatic, opulent, but young. Opens with brooding aromas of black currants, cassis and spices, and turns dense in tannins in the mouth. Deeply refined, concentrated, intense, bone dry. A classic Napa wine in every sense, and one in need of extended cellaring. 2012–2018. The release date is Spring 2010.",275.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
41266,Valley of the Moon 2006 Rosato di Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Sangiovese doesn't do well in California as a dry table wine but it makes a pretty good rosé. The grape's naturally high acidity frames its classic cherry flavors, which are deliciously clean and pure in this steel-fermented wine. Best of all, the wine is relatively low in alcohol and dry. Try this polished rosé with sushi.",14.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
41268,Lazy River 2006 Private Lumpkin Riesling,"This is made by Eric Hamacher (Carlton Winemakers Studio) and mixes dried herb, tea, honeysuckle and green apple in a convivial style. Round and fruity, it's dry without being stiff or steely. Very drinkable.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
41276,Gallo Family Vineyards 2006 Sonoma Reserve Pinot Gris (Sonoma County),"Crisp, juicy acidity and tangy flavors of Meyer lemons and limes make this wine immediately appealing. Partial barrel fermentation adds a touch of toast and cream, but a keen racy freshness really is the hallmark.",15.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
41473,Gloria Ferrer 2006 Reserve Cuvée Late Disgorged Extra Brut Sparkling (Carneros),"Bright, citrusy yellow, this wine conveys a nutty, creamy custard and marshmallow component to the nose. Fuller-bodied in substance and style, it nonetheless remains stony and steely on the palate, finishing with a twist of ginger and dried herb. It will be a fine fit with food.",45.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
41635,Tortoise Creek 2006 Merlot (Central Coast),"Tastes more like Cabernet, with black currant flavors and sturdy tannins, but the point is that it's a nice, dry, full-bodied table wine. The brand's been around for a while and is proving to be a consistent good value.",12.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
41653,Robert Hall 2006 Vintage Port (Paso Robles),"Honey-sweet, with blackberry, cherry and caramel flavors. Yet it feels unyielding, offering the tease but not the follow-through of richness. Drink now.",34.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
41665,Matthews Estate 2006 Claret (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The complex blend of Bordeaux grapes does not quite jell into a wine with specific focus. It's dark and tastes of black cherry, with grainy tannins and a chalky finish. The acids are not well integrated and the wine seems disjointed in the finish.",30.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
41667,IL Gioiello 2006 Morse Vineyards Montepulciano (Amador County),"A big, dry, tannicly astringent wine. It's somewhat awkward now and could develop softness in a year or two. Right now it's like Zinfandel, with brambly tannins and flavors of dark wild berries, leather and black pepper.",28.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
41756,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and a little bitter in tannins, with flavors of cherries, cranberries and herbs. It's elegantly constructed and feels silky and balanced in the mouth. A very nice and versatile food wine that will take a few years of cellaring.",19.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
41804,Tulpen 2006 Coalescence Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 70% Cabernet, 20% Merlot. Dark, tight and loaded with fruits, this balanced, juicy wine has it all—elegance, length, finesse and mouth appeal. Blackberry and black cherry fruits dominate, with light suggestions of pretty leaf, tobacco, earth and some iron.",30.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
41805,AlmaTerra 2006 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"Really fragrant, with this vineyard's near-perfect mix of fruit, rock and barrel. This is restrained, elegant but powerful—raspberry fruit over crushed rock, with vertical structure, an immaculate mouthfeel, and a finish that continues to resonate for minutes after the swallow.",50.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
41816,Soos Creek 2006 Artist Series #7 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon share top billing here, in a sleek, stylish, beautifully polished wine loaded with blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Firm and textural, it layers in subtle spices, dark chocolate, espresso and moist loam, all in delicate balance. The firmness of the tannins and tightness of the layering suggests that laying it down for a few years will only improve it further.",28.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
42032,Mauritson 2006 Buck Pasture Red (Rockpile),"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is very dense in fruit and also very Tannic with a capital T. Such is the astringency that it may never go away before the blackberry and black currant fruit drops out. Nonetheless it's dry and savory and, in its own Rockpiley way, classic. Drink with superrich barbecue, well-marbled grilled beef and such. Tasted twice.",50.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
42183,Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Primitivo (Amador County),"Porty and bitter and hot. High alcohol gives a peppery burn, while overripe fruit gives raisiny, pruny flavors. But some people will like it for its heady exuberance.",24.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
42258,Nickel & Nickel 2006 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),"Far more tannic and closed down than most Oakville Bordeaux red wines, this Merlot's dry tannins are its main feature. It's tough, dry and astringent, with a core of black cherries, currants and smoky oak. But it shows promise. Try cellaring through 2012.",50.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
42265,Bluenose 2006 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Here's a good, lusty Zin that has real Sonoma character. It's dry and rich in tannins, with exuberant flavors of wild forest berries, mocha, leather, dusty spices and sandalwood.",25.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
42281,Rancho Zabaco 2006 Toreador Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a big, tannic Zinfandel from a premier vineyard now owned by Gallo. The flavors are bigtime, offering an eruption of blackberries, currants, spiced rum punch, chocolate and licorice. Think of it as Zinfandel on steroids. Calls for equally hefty barbecue, but also has the structure to age interestingly over the next six years, at least.",60.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
42832,Hatcher 2006 Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"Dark, tannic and dense, this is a classic Petite Sirah. In its youth it's strongly flavored in black currants and chocolate, and will be fine with richly sauced barbecue. But it will age for many, many years, gradually softening.",26.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
42841,Mark Ryan 2006 The Dissident Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This mongrel is 50% Red Mountain Syrah, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot. Tight and tart, it has a slightly reduced, rubber ball character, and needs plenty of breathing time. Fruit flavors are raspberry and cassis, accented with sharp acids and stiff tannins.",28.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
42846,Tsillan Cellars 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile.",28.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
42864,Boudreaux Cellars 2006 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just a single barrel was made, pure Sangiovese from the Candy Mountain Vineyard. Tight, tart and dark, it captures black cherry fruit with black licorice and a whiff of smoke. At this point in time the tannins and acids seem to be fighting it out for control.",50.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
42868,McCrea Cellars 2006 Amerique Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Lots of wood on the nose, and some scents of pickle that reflect the American oak barrels. The flavors follow along, spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, with streaks of pickle and wood and a burst of alcoholic heat in the finish. The blend includes 17% Mourvèdre.",34.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
42874,Qupé 2006 Bien Nacido Hillside Estate Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"Delicious, dry and complex, with wild blackberry, Provençal herb, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Feels elegant, but too soft, lacking the structural integrity a fine wine needs. Drink now.",40.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
42983,Quady North 2006 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year, and this year they've chosen this superb Syrah. Whiffs of earth and bud, roasted meat and licorice fill the nose, with flavors following. The fruit is like brandy-soaked cherries, wrapped in all the roasted, earthy, organic layers. Tasted even better after being open for 24 hours.",65.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
42987,Quady North 2006 Cabernet Franc (Applegate Valley),"Cab Franc from Southern Oregon may not be on your radar, but this bottle suggests it should be. Violets and leather perfume the nose, introducing soft, round purple fruits highlighted with cinnamon and licorice. Maybe not technically perfect, but what a mouthful of delicious flavors.",35.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
43078,Margerum 2006 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Co-fermented with a small quantity of Viognier, this Syrah was aged in 100% new oak. It's flashy and completely satisfying to drink now. Starts a little soft and dry, then explodes midpalate into a burst of cherry and raspberry fruit, with creamy, caramelized notes. The finish is long-lasting and elegant.",50.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
43168,Prager 2006 Tomas Imogene's Vineyard Port (Napa Valley),"Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate. Good and sound, but lacks the continuing richness you want in a true Port-style wine, especially at this price.",52.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
43343,Spann Vineyards 2006 Chardonnay-Viognier (Sonoma County),"Spann is building a decent track record with their Chardonnay-Viognier blend. The wine is very ripe and attractive in tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and while it's a little on the sweet side, the acidity pulls it back from the brink.",20.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
43402,Korbin Kameron 2006 Cuvée Kristin Red (Sonoma Mountain),"A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.",55.0,93,3,0.9523485422044722
43464,Matanzas Creek 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke.",24.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
43477,Owen Roe 2006 Sinister Hand Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The wine is two-thirds Grenache, 30% Syrah and the rest Mourvèdre. It's warm and fruity, lightly spicy and finishing with tannins showing green tea and leaf. This is mostly Elerding fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills vineyard; balanced and firm.",24.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
43937,Stuart Cellars 2006 Lopez Ranch Vintners Special Select Reserve Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),"Very, very dry, but bitter in raisinskin flavors and tannins, with a baked currant finish. Not a bad wine, but an acquired taste. Drink now.",30.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
44315,Edizione Pennino 2006 Zinfandel (Rutherford),"This is one of the few Zinfandels with a Rutherford appellation. It's quite a good wine, deliciously easy to drink with its creamy texture and dry, soft flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and licorice, made all the more zesty with peppery spices. Great job by veteran winemaker Scott McLeod. From Francis Ford Coppola and Rubicon.",45.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
44337,Hourglass 2006 Blueline Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Very big and smoky, an impressive young Merlot that grabs you by the collar and shakes you. Made by the veteran Robert Foley, it's in his style, a ripe, powerful wine exuding massive flavors of black cherries, cassis and chocolate.",75.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
44369,Ottimino Vineyards 2006 Rancho Bello Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A wildly flavored, tannic and exuberant Zinfandel that showcases the variety's exotic personality. Dry and full-bodied, it has brambly flavors of blackberries, black currants, licorice, mocha and smoky cedar, liberally sprinkled with dusty Asian spices. Drink now–2013.",26.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
44379,Clif Family 2006 The Climber Red (California),"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice.",17.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
44383,Mazzocco 2006 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol.",50.0,81,3,0.9523485422044722
44394,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.",125.0,97,3,0.9523485422044722
44486,Io 2006 Ryan Road Vineyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County),"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",48.0,92,3,0.9523485422044722
44572,Crane Brothers 2006 Brodatious Crane Ranch Vineyard Red (Napa Valley),"A Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this red wine is dry and rich in currant and cedar flavors. But it's a little sharp and green in tannins, with a tart mouthfeel. A good steak will help, but it's not really an ager, so drink up.",36.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
44617,Basel Cellars 2006 Inspired Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Roughly three-fifths Merlot and two fifths Cabernet Franc. Though the blend and oak treatment are quite similar to the 2005, this new release comes out with far better balance and structure. The oak flavors are lighter, the tannins are polished and lightly herbal, as befits Cabernet Franc, and there is a hint of steel in the backbone of this tight, svelte effort.",40.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
44618,Bergevin Lane 2006 Intuition Reserve Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Bergevin's Bordeaux blend is almost jet black in color, thick with liquorous candied cherry and coffee scents. It's mostly Wahluke Slope (Stone Tree vineyard) fruit, and has the power to show for it. Black fruits, tar, coffee liqueur, chocolate, whiffs of tobacco make for a complex and compact wine that will reward cellaring.",55.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
44623,Peju 2006 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A little overripe and raisiny, but otherwise delicious, with sculpted Napa tannins framing luscious flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sandalwood, and a generous sprinkling of peppery spices. Drink now.",28.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
44640,Thurston Wolfe 2006 Zephyr Ridge Petite Sirah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is the fifth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah. It is almost jet black in the center, purple at the rim, tight and tannic with plenty of acid sculpting the earthy, black cherry fruit. Loaded into the finish are layers of earth, iodine, tar and licorice; it's very well made and retains just enough roughness to satisfy lovers of this often rustic grape.",22.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
44826,VJB 2006 Barbera (Mendocino County),"Sweet and soft, like melted jam, this Barbera has plush blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. Given its tannins and acids, it will probably age for a long time.",34.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
44827,X 2006 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Tastes overly sweet, almost like a dessert wine, the result of residual sugar. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries and chocolate are wrapped in a soft texture.",25.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
44835,Paso Creek 2006 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Tough, tannicly dry and gritty, this simple country Zin needs big barbecued beef or chicken dishes slathered with sweet BBQ sauce.

44837,JAQK Cellars 2006 Soldiers of Fortune Shiraz (Napa Valley),"Soft and fruity, this Syrah is technically dry, but so fruity, it almost tastes like a candy. Shows red cherry, red currant, cola, roasted almond and licorice flavors, like a fruit bar you buy in the health store.",50.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
44853,Terra d'Oro 2006 Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Too sugary sweet by far, which is partly the result of very high alcohol but may also be due to some residual sugar. The sweetness draws attention to the oak, and makes it taste stronger than it really is. Despite flavors of blackberries, blueberries and mocha, this wine is too Porty and unbalanced.",29.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
44889,Brooklyn Oenology 2006 Social Club Red Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Warming spice, cherry and plum on the nose and palate give this wine a food-friendly edge. A touch of smoke and mocha adds appeal. Pair with grilled meats, pastas.",15.0,84,3,0.9523485422044722
45147,Pride Mountain 2006 Viognier (Sonoma County),"The gigantic flavors are there, showing the exotic, flamboyant side of Viognier. Peach, pineapple, kiwi, Key lime pie, honeysuckle blossom, roasted almond, smoky new oak and Asian spices lead to a dry, honeyed finish. There's an edgy awkwardness, though, that limits elegance. Might simply be too young. Best after mid-2008.",42.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45160,Meridian 2006 Pinot Grigio (California),"Here's a classic example of why Americans are buying Pinot Grigio. The wine is marked by fresh, zesty acidity that cleanses the palate and is so compatible with things like goat cheese and grilled veggies. Very slightly sweet, it shows flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, pineapples and clover honey.",10.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
45167,Castle 2006 Nelson Vineyards Late Harvest Viognier (Mendocino),"Already possessing the deep, old gold color of a mature dessert wine, this lush Viognier tastes fresh as a daisy. Its crisp acids frame sweet flavors of apricots, oranges, vanilla custard, white chocolate and honey. It's not an ager, though, so drink now.",32.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
45169,Girard 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"So classically structured and elegant, it might almost be a Bordeaux red variety instead of Zinfandel, except for the black pepper. Brings Napa-esque control and tannins to the blackberries, currants and chocolate, and should develop for up to 6 years.",24.0,89,3,0.9523485422044722
45170,O•S Winery 2006 Red Wine Red (Washington),"This inexpensive red wine has muscle and depth. It's chocolaty, rich and loaded with ripe, supple fruits and smooth caramel.

45184,Sausal 2006 Zin XXV Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Made in a forwardly delicious style from older vines, the XXXV designation is for Sausal's 35th anniversary. The aromas and flavors range from briary blackberries and cherries through carob and licorice to cedar, sweet candle wax, bacon, black pepper and soy sauce.

45185,Rulo 2006 Syrca Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 70% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is tight, spicy, peppery and sharp. Though probably not a wine for cellaring, despite its slightly green fruit, it has density, flavor and depth. As it breathes and smoothes out, black currant and blackberry fruit flavors begin to poke through, and a streak of licorice does also.",18.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
45264,Snoqualmie 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A decent effort, with notes of spice, brambly wild berries, smoke and licorice mingling together. It doesn't quite snap into focus, but there's never a dull moment. The finish gets chalky as the tannins take over.",10.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
45266,JC Cellars 2006 Fess Parker's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Overtly sweet, like sugared blackberry tea with a squeeze of cassis and a bite of milk chocolate. Good flavors, but should be drier and firmer in structure as a table wine.",30.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
45273,Ironstone 2006 Cabernet Franc (Lodi),"For the price, you get a fair deal with this dry, clean wine. It has flavors of cherries and oak and spice, and goes down nice and easy.",10.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
45274,Koehler 2006 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit rustic, with firm tannins and sweet currant and chocolate flavors side by side with greener, minty ones. Acidity is low, making the mouthfeel soft. Not going anywhere.",32.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722

45292,Helix by Reininger 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Smooth and supple, this Helix Syrah is consistent with past efforts. There's more than a trace of herb and earth, plenty of acid and some tannins with more than a hint of compost and green tea. But for all that earthiness the wine has grip and concentration, with fruit that seems natural and honest. Don't look for jam or sweet preserves; this is more to the gamy, herbal side of the grape, but beautifully balanced.",27.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
45302,Greenwood Ridge 2006 Estate Bottled Merlot (Mendocino Ridge),"This is a big, ripe, distinctly New World Merlot that shows off its terroir to perfection. A long, sunny growing season has given explosive currant, blackberry jam and mocha flavors, while cool nights have preserved vital acidity and firm tannins. Drink now, with grilled steak topped with a blue cheese and brown butter sauce.",27.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
45308,Saviah 2006 Une Vallée Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend—60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 6% Cab Franc—comes from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and McClellan vineyard fruit. Round and approachable, it puts the sweet and tangy flavors of cherry and berry front and center, yet has the structure to age for up to a decade. These are the oldest blocks of fruit that Saviah uses, and this, says winemaker Rich Funk, stands as the winery's signature wine.",32.0,91,3,0.9523485422044722
45476,Zepaltas 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.",48.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
45480,Woodward Canyon 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular— let's say it, masculine—style of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.",39.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
45582,Schramsberg 2006 Crémant Demi-Sec Sparkling (North Coast),"Made in an off-dry manner, with residual sugar of 3.5%, this blend of the Flora grape and Chardonnay is rich and fruity. It has flavors of golden mango, tangerine tart, vanilla cookie and honey almond granola.",38.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
45732,Adobe Road 2006 Bavarian Lion Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Knights Valley),"Decent, by most definitions, but a clumsy wine. It's hot in high alcohol, simple and jammy sweet in blackberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Not going anywhere.",38.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
45736,Kamiak 2006 Merlot (Yakima Valley),There is nothing wimpy about this 100% pure Merlot. The firm core of tart berry and currant adds iron and clove highlights through a concentrated midpalate; the finish is a bit rough and hints at green tannins.,16.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45738,Lake Sonoma 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Classic Dry Creek Zin, dry and firmly tannic and bursting with pepper, briary wild berry, tamari and chamomile flavors. Calls for a broiled steak, drizzled with garlic and rosemary-infused brown butter sauce.",19.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45740,Merry Cellars 2006 Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This tight and tannic Cab Franc tastes of cranberry, wild raspberry and green coffee bean. It's a crisp evocation of not overly ripe varietal character, leaning toward the Loire Valley versions of the grape rather than anything distinctly New World.",30.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45741,Merry Cellars 2006 Carmenère (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The structure is Cabernet-like, and the peppery and herbal character of Carmenère is there in abundance, along with accent notes of dried sage. The fruit is sharp and plummy, and the wine has been aged for 14 months in oak.",34.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45749,R & B Cellars 2006 Saxy Syrah (North Coast),"Robust and country-style, this is a nice wine for barbecue and beef stews. Very dry and tannic, it shows harmonious flavors of blackberries, currants and wild nettles. Buy this young wine for your full-bodied house red.",12.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
45774,Glen Fiona 2006 Cuvée Parallel 46 Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Rhone-style cuvée is a little thin—light, the fruit showing generic strawberry flavors, with a sprinkling of dried herbs.",25.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
45775,Glen Fiona 2006 Puncheon Select Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Much of a piece with its companion releases, this is done in a lighter style, with plum and berry fruit, dried herbs and a short, simple finish.",20.0,85,3,0.9523485422044722
45809,Ojai 2006 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Winemaker Adam Tolmach has achieved a real success, crafting a fresh, delicious wine that's moderate in alcohol by California standards, yet fully ripe. Cherries, black raspberries, rhubarb pie, spicy pomegranate, pumpkin pie and licorice flood the mouth. Best now for its youthful vibrancy.",35.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
45812,Walla Walla Vintners 2006 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The winemakers speak of “wild chokecherry jam” flavors. OK. There are interesting, wild berry flavors, along with the winery's generous, milk chocolaty, oaked-up finish. Still young and knitting together, if this wine follows the path of earlier successes, it will begin to expand and fill out over the next five or six years.",28.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
45816,Io 2006 Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),"From a producer with a proven track record for Rhône wines comes this powerful, dramatically structured 100% Grenache. Shows the variety's lush cherry flavors, with complex layers of grilled meat, dark chocolate, black licorice, violets and peppery spice. A bit hard and closed in tannins, it should be given a good decanting.",35.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
46001,Alienor 2006 Grand Vin Red (Lake County),"A beautiful wine that will redefine the way you view Lake County. Mostly Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's extraordinarily rich and refined in the mouth, a lovely wine to drink now. Shows new oak-inspired raspberry, cherry, red currant and Indian spice flavors that linger into a long finish.",65.0,94,3,0.9523485422044722
46135,Silverado 2006 Mt. George Merlot (Napa Valley),"You'll find a rich vein of cherries, red currants and cedar, leading to a dry, spicy finish, but the velvety smoothness you want in a fine Merlot is what it lacks.",35.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
46570,Breaux 2006 Nebbiolo (Virginia),"Scents and flavors of rosemary-crusted charred meat, raspberry and cassis liqueur balance savoriness with fruitiness. The palate bears firm, chewy tannins that are buttressed by uplifting acids.",38.0,86,3,0.9523485422044722
46680,Von Strasser 2006 Marcellini Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District),"This lovely Cab Franc offers a softer, gentler version of Von Strasser's Cabernet Sauvignons. It shows the same dense mountain tannins and dryness, but is comprised of red cherry, red currant and violet flavors, in addition to the sweet smoky oak. Best now, with decanting, and through 2011.",75.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
46682,Paradise Ridge 2006 Hoenselaars Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Spicy and briary, with wild berry, currant, tobacco, coffee, cedar and peppery spice flavors and a brambly mouthfeel. Classic Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's dry and rich in tannins, and the alcohol level is moderate. Great with upscale barbecue.",35.0,90,3,0.9523485422044722
47422,Shenandoah 2006 Rezerve Paul's Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"A beautifully exuberant mountain Zin. There's nothing shy or reserved about its power blast of wild briary berries, currants, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. Deliciously complex and distinctly Zinny.",24.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
47425,Acorn 2006 Alegria Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),"There's something ruggedly luscious about this Cab Franc. It's not an ager or particularly complicated, but it does offer up a panoply of ripe red and black currants, anise, dark chocolate and spice flavors. It finishes dry, balanced and charming.",32.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
47426,Audelssa 2006 Summit Red (Sonoma Valley),"Fans of sheer fruit will exult in this wine for its masses of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, chocolate and even raspberries that flood the palate. Beyond that, it offers good tannins and fine acidity. There isn't much complexity or layering, but it sure is tasty.",52.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
47433,Eberle 2006 Steinbeck Vineyard & Wine-Bush Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A big, lush, exuberant Zinfandel, stuffed with sun-ripened fruit flavors of dark berries, coffee, chocolate and spice. Drink this dry, warming wine now.",24.0,87,3,0.9523485422044722
47484,Des Voigne Cellars 2006 Montreux Syrah (Red Mountain),"This is a substantial, dense Syrah, which runs quickly from berries and cherries right into barrel flavors of chocolate and butterscotch. It's balanced and delicious, but does not have the complexity and more interesting earth/herb notes that the grape is capable of.",30.0,88,3,0.9523485422044722
47688,Ravines 2006 Meritage Red Table Wine Red (Finger Lakes),"A simple but bright cherry and warm spice nose marks this Meritage, and on the palate, a soft array of berry and oaky spice follows. It's not terribly intergrated or elegant, but the wine has a good overall flavor and will pair well with fowl or beef.",25.0,83,3,0.9523485422044722
47697,Karly 2006 El Alacran Mourvèdre (Amador County),"With the heat of very high alcohol, the taste of overripe, raisiny fruit and a sweet finish, this is not a successful wine. But then, Mourvèdre is notoriously difficult to control.",35.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
47705,Long Point 2006 Ciera Rosé (New York),"Affordable and friendly, this refreshing wine offers strawberry jam and orange marmalade on the nose and a mineral-driven flavor profile. The fruit is overtaken by the acidity to some extent, but the wine still makes for a tasty warm weather sip.",9.0,82,3,0.9523485422044722
