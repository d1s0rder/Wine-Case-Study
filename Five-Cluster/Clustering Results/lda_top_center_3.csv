98305,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Light and fresh up front, with lychee, passion fruit and wet stone aromas. Feels good and balanced as if offers a nice mix of textured fruit and minerally acidity. Flavors of green melon, passion fruit, lime and green herbs come straight from central casting. Perfect for summer drinking.",13.0,89,3,0.9716761628646314
72603,Apolloni 2007 Pinot Grigio (Willamette Valley),"Apolloni seems to be the first Oregon winery to take advantage of a change in the state's labeling laws allowing Pinot Grigio to be used; previously Pinot Gris was required. This is in fact much like a classic Italian Pinot Grigio, crisp and acidic, with sharply-defined citrus, melon and green apple fruit. Clean and refreshing, it carries a lovely floral note through the persistent finish.",17.0,89,3,0.9710598336880853
34997,Bonny Doon 2014 Gravitas White (California),"Grapefruit blossoms, scratched pink grapefruit skin and Granny Smith apples show on the delicate nose of this blend of 54% Sémillon, 43.5% Sauvignon Blanc and 2.5% Orange Muscat. It's light, bright and easy on the palate, with cut green apple and lime juice flavors, making it perfect to pair with plenty of lighter foods.",16.0,88,3,0.969925182984469
5296,Giornata 2015 Ramato Quattro Bassi Ranch Vineyard Pinot Grigio (San Luis Obispo),"This is a challenging wine, but it takes bravery to make Pinot Grigio like a red wine, using amphorae and terra cotta along the way. It's pink, but not a rose. Zesty aromas of tangerine, wet stone and grapefruit skins also show a bit of yeast. There is strong kumquat tang to the sip, which is fairly sour without the ripeness one might expect from the color.",35.0,88,3,0.9698179294702296
85635,Salomon-Undhof 2016 Stein a.d. Donau Riesling (Kremstal),"An aromatic nose suggests fresh green pear, a touch of yeast and both citrus flesh and foliage: think lemon and lime. The palate has a stonger impression of yeast, giving an almost-salty texture, with a bright lemon streak of freshness. It's taut, dry, slender and refreshing.",25.0,91,3,0.967470747227292
97495,Santa Carolina 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of passion fruit, grapefruit, lime and bell pepper are textbook for the region. This feels fresh as a whistle, with pyrazine-led bell pepper, green bean and lime flavors. Additional notes of bell pepper, with hints of white pepper drive the finish on this crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc.",11.0,87,3,0.9674700556829264
73549,Château de Lancyre 2014 Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup),"This attractive rosé is always pleasing, as evidenced by pretty aromas of red cherry, strawberry, melon rind and soft sweet spice. The mouthfeel is light and vibrant, with mouthwatering acidity and bright red fruit and citrus flavors. The finish is short, but clean and refreshing. Drink now.",20.0,88,3,0.9669680305214975
104336,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2006 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Bright, clean flavors of cranberry and strawberry make this dry rosé easy on the palate and the wallet. There's a fruity kick on the nose followed by a dry but flavorful wave of flavors that seem perfect for a picnic or summertime sip under flapping sails. Pair this with seafood or poultry or experiment a little—its refreshing, crisp quality will play well with most foods.",15.0,87,3,0.9662670100575671
38496,Botalcura 2011 El Delirio Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"A touch green and vegetal on the nose, with hints of canned peas and bell pepper. Fortunately there's enough lime and minerality to keep it fresh. Feels crisp, tight and wet, with green notes pervading core citrus flavors. Finishes pithy and zesty, with mild bitterness.",9.0,85,3,0.9661816654060151
52736,Baehner Fournier 2013 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Very citrusy aromas of fresh squeezed lemons grow rounder with pear and nectarine flesh, all cut by a white rock minerality, without many of the typical grassy notes. The palate is very tight with lime juice and green apples, and driven by chalky grip and vibrant acidity.",25.0,88,3,0.9661006234617523
65994,Montes 2015 Spring Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Passion fruit, lettuce, grapefruit and tropical aromas get this Sauvignon Blanc off to a nice start. Zesty, speedy and super fresh on the palate, with blazing acidity, this tastes of passion fruit, green herbs and grass, especially on a racy, slightly pithy finish.",16.0,89,3,0.966073154173998
69075,Laetitia 2014 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. There is great energy to the sip, where somewhat sour flavors of Ruby Red grapefruit rind give the wine lots of acidic length.",34.0,90,3,0.9659901411446918
114564,Dry Creek Vineyard 2000 Limited Edition DCVIII Fumé Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palate—mostly green beans and some pickle. Fortunately, there is also a light tropical fruit background to the flavor profile, something reminiscent of papaya. Ultimately, however, this wine is characterized more by its vegetal character than bright, clean fruit.",18.0,86,3,0.9659835354502649
63757,Kiwi Cuvée 2015 Bin 086 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"Light scents of lime, white melon rind, green gooseberry and fresh-cut grass dance on the nose of this dainty white, followed by flavors of underripe pear and tart currant on the light-weight palate. It's fresh and lively, finishing short but clean. Drink up.",10.0,84,3,0.9659109697672842
27570,Hamelin Bay 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Margaret River),"The bouquet starts off snappy and clean, but with time some pungent sea foam and green-bean aromas arise. Basic pear, melon and green herbs make up the flavor profile, while the short finish, though offering ample pepper and mineral, is lacking in fruit.",22.0,87,3,0.9658428902753426
10471,Luis Felipe Edwards 2013 Marea Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"If you want to taste a true cool-climate SB with chiseled aromas and tons of cutting acidity, this is it. Aromas are lightly vegetal but also include citrus and passion fruit. Flavors of tangerine, passion fruit, rosemary and thyme finish citrusy and zesty. This is so linear it will cut through almost any kind of food.",25.0,90,3,0.9647578079873147
43048,Carr 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Rather than pungent green aromas, this bottling tends toward a sweeter aromatic profile, with limeade, mandarin orange and tangerine scents. On the palate, there is a slight creaminess and a nod toward bell pepper, but the tart, bitter and acidic elements of apple and lime pith combine memorably.",18.0,90,3,0.964716036114858
73125,Undurraga 2012 T.H. Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"This Casablanca SB opens with crisp, dry, capped aromas of ocean foam, citrus and green herbs. It's true to form in the mouth, with nice acidity and citrusy zest.

46741,Morgadío 2015 Legado del Conde Albariño Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Citrus and apple aromas are fresh, reserved and on the light side. In the mouth, this pops with lemony acidity and related tang. Flavors of tart green apple and lime are racy almost to the point of being sour, while this ends with a tingle of sharp acidity and a sense of wet stones and minerals.",16.0,88,3,0.9646046290569344
41670,Falernia 2008 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),"Dusty apple, pear and other dry-fruit aromas give this clean wine a good but basic starting point. The palate is fresh but exceedingly simple in terms of its apple, kiwi and nectarine flavors. Pithy and bitter on the finish, but fresh. Tastes and smells like a standard white Rioja.",9.0,85,3,0.964538598849024
45945,Willow Crest 2009 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),"This Yakima Valley bottling highlights fresh herbs and sharp, juicy pear and apple fruit flavors. The vivid fruit is racy and tightly defined, and seems to gather strength and focus as it sits in the mouth. A splendid effort that really sets the standard for Washington Pinot Gris.",12.0,90,3,0.9645262203416176
99622,Santa Ema 2013 Amplus Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Saline, lime, grass, bell pepper and green bean aromas swirl around the bouquet on this fresh, coastal SB. This feels round yet crisp, with modest acidic cut and flavors or orange, passion fruit and minerals. Finishing flavors are similar, with a hint of green herb.",22.0,89,3,0.9645225962941488
114637,Barrack 2012 Happy Canyon Vineyards Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend hits the nose with near-petrol scents, and then slides into a slightly sour orange juice zone. On the palate, that citrusy intrigue continues into a lime zest finish. It's a vibrant, refreshing sipper, though it leans on tingling acidity more than overall balance. Serve with cacio e pepe pasta, raw oysters, or anything needing a lemony boost.",36.0,87,3,0.9644111363369878
115597,Casa Silva 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),"Smells neither tropical nor citric as it falls somewhere in the middle of those two common denominators. Feels wet, fresh and minerally, with flavors of lime, green melon, sour apple, green herbs and mineral. Clean, well-cut and tight on the finish, with zesty length.",12.0,88,3,0.9643860742537993
104471,San Simeon 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Slightly sour raspberry, orange juice and earth tones show on the nose of this bottling from the Los Angeles-based Riboli family of San Antonio Winery fame. The palate is a bit thin, with orange rind and cranberry juice flavors, proving fresh and lively though a touch sour.",18.0,87,3,0.9641383952058268
43024,Kitá 2016 Camp 4 Vineyard Rosé of Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"The delicate yet brilliant pink color of this rosé is stunning (Could it be protected by the darker glass, a rare packaging choice for the style?) and the wine inside matches up, starting with a brisk nose of red apple, white cherry, strawberry and lime. There's red plum and more strawberry to the sip. With a grippy texture and steadily rising acidity, this is one of the better pinks of the vintage.",18.0,91,3,0.9635093328145428
35364,Undurraga 2012 Sibaris Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"An almost neutral nose offers mild green herb and citrus aromas but little more. The palate is zesty, tangy and fresh, while a narrow set of lemon-lime, grapefruit and lime flavors ends with focused crispness. For something tight and refreshing, this is it.",16.0,88,3,0.9632402035827803
29112,Cebada 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"A pretty pale pink in color, this bottling is very yeasty, reminiscent of a sparkling wine, also showing sour strawberry, wet stone and orange peel on the nose. The yeast is prominent through the sip, dominating the sharp kumquat and pink-fruit flavors.",32.0,86,3,0.9631548168872752
67413,Sinor-LaVallee 2014 Vin Gris Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Pale pink in color, this wine by Mike Sinor shows just-cut lemon, a touch of nectarine, gray slate and a lemon-cucumber element on the tart, refreshing nose. It's quite quaffable and simultaneously thought-provoking, with concrete minerality and razor-sharp acidity framing Pink Lady apple and blood orange fruits, with a subtle ashy component as well.",21.0,90,3,0.9631505513146231
108579,Tablas Creek 2016 Vermentino (Adelaida District),"Fairly light aromas of fresh lemon, nectarine, scratched grapefruit skin and a little chalk show on the nose of this crisp bottling. The palate is all about tension and acid-driven freshness, with pear peels and lime rinds making for a slightly sour sip.",27.0,90,3,0.9630821602862581
108552,Alto Los Romeros 2012 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Bell pepper, green bean and asparagus aromas come with a touch of melon but nothing more fruity than that. A citrusy, round palate houses bitter, stretched flavors of green fruits and sulfur. Green herbs and citrus peel are the finishing notes on this grassy, green SB.",17.0,83,3,0.9630817727647002
54278,Errazuriz 2014 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa),"This smells typical of coastal Chilean SB, meaning it's citrusy and green, but the nose seems a touch flat. Not so the palate, which is snappy and juicy. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit lead the way, with a backing of green bean and mild bell pepper controlling a crisp, fresh finish.",20.0,89,3,0.9630787818554855
63981,Palo Alto 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"Shows a prickly side that's true to the variety. Smells and tastes slightly salinic, but also shows good verve and mouthfeel. This is a lively style of SB with citrus and green-apple flavors. It finishes with edgy gooseberry and seems committed to the crisp, lean style (even from warmer Maule Valley).",13.0,86,3,0.9630638230914748
71084,Tangent 2014 Paragon Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley),"Classic and yet distinctive in aromatics, this bottling from the Niven family's cool-climate vineyard shows cut grass, wet cement and a touch of struck match on the narrowly focused nose. The palate intrigues, with fresh-cut thyme and oregano lifted by a white pepper element.",13.0,90,3,0.9630497282477788
42054,Zaca Mesa 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"Aromas of lychee, wet slate and just-cut kiwi combine for a tightly wound nose on this wine from one of the region's pioneering properties. The palate clings close to the lime, lemon and pink grapefruit pith flavors that open a little toward apple flesh and a pinch of herbs.",16.0,88,3,0.9630485133261392
69315,Sanford 2013 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very light in color in the glass, this appellation blend shows cut nectarine, lemon juice and apple skins on the easy, restrained but energetic nose. The palate offers touches of Pink Lady apple, nectarine and squeezed tangerine. It's altogether crisp and refreshing while retaining the grape's familiar notes.",45.0,89,3,0.9630398135024072
49153,Mud House 2014 The Woolshed Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Green notes lead the parade here: Grass, peas and tomato leaf march ahead of the lemon citrus notes, with an intriguing struck-match character taking up the rear. On the palate, the acidity is prominent but in check, and the slightly chalky texture is appealing. When it comes to flavor, however, it loses much of what the nose offers, finishing a little flat and bitter.",20.0,88,3,0.9630369302065287
62616,Anakena 2012 Tama Vineyard Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of passion fruit, tangerine, bell pepper and grass lead to a plump palate with soft acids. Flavors of pithy, slightly bitter green fruits, bell pepper and passion fruit end in a modest finish that rapidly loses steam.",15.0,85,3,0.9630080481790285
95511,Amalie Robert 2008 Vintage Debut Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Light and delicate, this “Vintage Debut” Pinot Noir skates along a pretty thin edge. Light hints of strawberry and cherry blossom lead into a pale wine with plenty of acidity. But despite the acclaimed vintage, this is pretty thin stuff.",30.0,85,3,0.9629472579009216
79584,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Refreshing, lively, this Pinot Gris starts with aromas of grapefruit and lemon and leads into zesty flavors of white pepper, lemon and grapefruit. A touch acidic, the wine could use more fruit balance, but overall an enjoyable dry white choice.",17.0,83,3,0.9629468147506883
57928,Marques de Tomares 2007 Don Román  (Rioja),"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character. Tastes a tiny bit sour by today's measurements, but it's still pretty good for being crisp and acid-driven.",15.0,85,3,0.9629259853153611
93178,Undurraga 2016 Sibaris Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus, bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity.",15.0,87,3,0.9628896706951044
6392,Cono Sur 2009 Grapes Organically Grown Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),"Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading.",13.0,84,3,0.9628800847028701
111218,Lemelson 2009 Stermer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tart and racy, Lemelson's Stermer single-vineyard selection shows a pleasing mix of red fruits, set in sharp acids that crisply define the core flavors. Clean and focused, with a tight but persistent finish that leaves the impression of fresh, bracing cranberries.",42.0,90,3,0.9628005097642555
74245,Dinastía Vivanco 2012 Vivanco Viura-Malvasia-Tempranillo Blanco White (Rioja),"This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes. The palate has citrusy kick and zing to bolster green apple and orange flavors. The finish is wide, a touch clumsy and citrusy in flavor, with tang and lasting freshness.",14.0,85,3,0.9627775235331766
63930,Alta Luna 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"Aromas of green bell pepper, chopped herb and crushed tomato vine lead the nose on this bright, fragrant wine.

34758,Martin Woods 2015 Garryana Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Garryana is the winery's previous moniker; once this vintage sells through all wines will be labeled Martin Woods. This bottling mixes green, gold and botrytized fruit from a single vineyard, all picked on the same day. The result is intriguing, though a bit disjointed. Bright gold, pungent and waxy in the mouth, it mixes accents of honeycomb with green-apple fruit that almost tastes like straight cider. The finish is quite dry.",25.0,89,3,0.962392965308079
3810,Firestone 2015 Barrel Select Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bright acidity translates to the aromas in this bottling: laser-sharp lime zest, squeezed grapefruit, dewy grass and wet gravel. Those scents grow riper as the wine warms, while the palate seems sweeter—more lime candy than fresh lime. It finishes tart, with a wet metal freshness.",20.0,87,3,0.9614949184989877
11260,O. Fournier 2012 Urban Uco Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),"Sassy passion-fruit and feline aromas set up a crisp, clean-feeling palate with tangy, green, zesty flavors of scallion, lime and sour apple. A minerally, chalky finish is zingy and clean. This is nice for value-priced Sauvignon Blanc.",9.0,86,3,0.9614658082306626
6547,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2016 Les Hospices Riesling (Alsace),"A gentle hint of restrained citrus freshness appears on the nose. The same restrained but wonderfully pure citrus flavor also characterizes the slender, light and dry palate: it's a mix of fresh lemon and aromatic, tangy tangerine peel. This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish.",25.0,90,3,0.9614433098980056
57494,Zudugarai 2011 White (Getariako Txakolina),"This is flat and lemony on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. It feels zesty and tastes of tart lemon-lime and green bean.

86955,La Bodega de Pinoso 2009 Flos de Pinoso Made With Organic Grapes Macabeo & Airén White (Alicante),"Apple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight. Flavors of dry apple and fresh corn work well, and while the finish is short and shy, it's crisp and clean. A simple wine with light fruit and easy drinkability.",13.0,86,3,0.9613414253410708
96904,Storks' Tower 2011 Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Crisp and likable, this smells stony and snappy, with spring pea, passion fruit and citrus aromas. It feels well cut, with green bean, grass and citrus flavors. While it hints at being vegetal, it maintains a consistent white-fruit and citrus profile.",10.0,86,3,0.9613181440146913
114662,CVNE 2016 Monopole Viura (Rioja),"Clean white-fruit aromas are simple but pleasant. This Viura has a round, plump body that's a touch flat. Salty citrus flavors come with notes of lime and green banana. A lasting finish is mild and tasty. Drink immediately.",13.0,87,3,0.9613098767758312
22156,Peñascal 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"This fresh but generic Sauvignon Blanc offers white-fruit aromas and zesty passion fruit scents.

105424,Valley of the Moon 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A little too sharp, which gives this thin Pinot Noir a sting. But it's nice and low in alcohol, with attractive cranberry and cola flavors, and elegant enough to drink with anything calling for Pinot Noir. The price is pretty good for the quality.",18.0,87,3,0.9612687121784987
62398,Matetic 2014 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Briny citrus and green-fruit aromas reflect cold-climate origins. This is zesty yet round, with acidic grit and bite. Green pepper, jalapeño and green melon flavors finish spicy and tangy, like bitter lettuce mixed with passion fruit and tangerine.",19.0,90,3,0.9612683832461274
67520,Nautilus 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"An atypically lean, focused Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with the emphasis on minerality and leafy components rather than tropical fruit. Citrus, wet stones and tomato leaves make for a slightly austere impression, finishing crisp and clean.",17.0,85,3,0.9612577506272307
42315,Telmo Rodríguez 2016 Basa Blanco Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Light dusty aromas are mildly sweaty and green. This Verdejo-Viura blend is crisp and stony, without much body weight.

59582,Alfredo Roca 2015 Fincas Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Aromas of straw, dusty apple and mild citrus are clean as a whole. Citric acidity lends zest to an otherwise chunky, pithy palate.

54880,A to Z 2015 Chardonnay (Oregon),"The market is loaded with inexpensive Oregon wines at the moment, but few if any can offer this kind of quality at this price point. Crisp and fresh, this brings a mix of lime, quinine, pine needles and green apples into play. Well defined and immaculately clean, it can accompany a range of salads, noodle dishes or cold cuts.",15.0,88,3,0.9611708382409206
102727,Kennedy Point 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This Waiheke Island-based winery sources its Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. The result is a rather leafy, slightly vegetal wine that's reminiscent of tomato stalk and celery leaf, yet remains refreshing and pleasant, with a strong citrus core. Try it with ceviche or simple broiled sole.",18.0,88,3,0.9611568053231531
106725,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Domaine Vallon des Cigales Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Pale in color, this blend of every possible Provençal grape variety (including some whites) is classic, easygoing Provence rosé. It has wild raspberry fruit and crisp acidity. A tangy, tight mineral texture adds to its refreshing nature.",14.0,87,3,0.9611564026454844
96724,Oveja Negra 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc-Carmenère White (Maule Valley),"Mild and appealing on the nose, with just enough citrus to convince you that it's Sauvignon Blanc.

11795,Santa Luz 2014 Gran Reserva Corte Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Grass, citrus fruits, feline and canned green-vegetable aromas lead into a plump, round palate.

32510,Torii Mor 2008 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a sharp, tart Pinot, scented with pine needles and showing wild strawberry fruit flavors and plenty of sharp acidity.

113824,Elki 2009 Vinas Viejas Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),"A very dry, crisp white wine with a neutral color and equally neutral aromas and flavors.

Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers.
