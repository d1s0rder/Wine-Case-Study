66264,Eichinger 2016 Ried Hasel Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"An aromatic touch of ivy plays alongside green pear on the nose. These aromas continue on the palate where they acquire a zesty, fresh edge reminiscent of grapefruit. A note of pepper joins on the slender, dry body. This is aromatic, light and very refreshing, with an invigorating, lip-smacking finish.",19.0,92,3,0.954827054893263,10-20
113954,Lynmar 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own.",20.0,92,3,0.9571098944013211,10-20
12056,Berger 2015 Lössterrassen Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing.",20.0,93,3,0.9546507460538443,10-20
91761,Tement 2013 Berghausener Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"The hinted lushness of passion fruit plays intriguingly around the straight-laced acidity of this classy Sauvignon Blanc. The body is light but profound. Very refreshing on its own or with light, delicate foods.",23.0,92,3,0.9419095845344688,20-40
107507,Pence Ranch 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Shy at first on the nose, this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills boundary winds up offering a very pretty if delicate nose of lime, salt and a touch of popcorn hidden in the background. It's high-toned and bright on the palate, with limestone, gray slate and lime-peel flavors, quite refreshing with each sip.",24.0,92,3,0.9591172665952551,20-40
94294,Tegernseerhof 2016 Terrassen Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"A touch of lemon zest, a hint of lime, a suspicion of yeast: the nose of this wine is fresh and restrained. Light but juicy, the body ripples with refreshing ease across the tongue. It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness.",24.0,92,3,0.9549876690498698,20-40

It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness.",24.0,92,3,0.9549876690498698,20-40
14043,Alta Maria 2013 Carbonic Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers.",24.0,92,3,0.954067952185302,20-40

86274,Inman Family 2013 Endless Crush Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer.",25.0,92,3,0.9457733604553648,20-40
14047,Inman Family 2013 Endless Crush Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage.

39861,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Loibner Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A nose of pure lemon zest also has the faintest notions of juniper and bitter orange peel that seem to assert themselves more on the slender, sylph-like body of this incisive wine. That lemony purity illuminates the taut palate and highlights those spicy reaches that are merely hinted at. A subtle wine of immense charm.",41.0,94,3,0.9490132864176457,above 40
41474,Goat Bubbles 2013 Solomon Hills Vineyard Sparkling Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A pleasant rose-petal pink in color, this wine by regional sparkling veteran Norm Yost shows red-grapefruit pulp and skin, lime spritz and a shred of bubble gum on the nose, playing both on hedonism and restraint. It's extremely refreshing once sipped, with more lime and pink grapefruit zest.",42.0,92,3,0.9524582419217499,above 40
80677,Big Table Farm 2013 Sunnyside Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Among a fascinating array of low-alcohol Pinots from this producer, this is the standout. Bright, tart raspberry fruit, immaculately clean and refreshing, is backed with crystalline minerality. There's a touch of wet cement and a persistent, engaging finish.",48.0,93,3,0.9457182156387947,above 40
29725,La Montagne 2012 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Slightly sour orange-cranberry aromas meet with a touch of sagebrush on this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard at the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. The even-keeled, very drinkable flavors surround tongue-tantalizing spice, light red fruit and a little caramel on the finish.",50.0,92,3,0.9540103787946435,above 40

70111,Ayoub 2014 ??? Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish.",55.0,94,3,0.9450498017581496,above 40
113215,Château Couhins-Lurton 2014  Pessac-Léognan,"Tangy and zesty, this is a crisp wine. It has tight acidity and a strongly citrus character. There are bright gooseberry and herbal flavors that show strongly. The downside is it is one-dimensional: all herbal fruit and crisp acidity. Drink from 2020.",63.0,92,3,0.9548793311630335,above 40
41480,Cobb 2012 Rice-Spivak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.",75.0,92,3,0.9482049144335435,above 40
