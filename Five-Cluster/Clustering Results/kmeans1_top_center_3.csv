1438,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2009  Saint-Émilion,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung.

1464,Château de Paillet-Quancard 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"Still lean and structured, this is a cool-feeling, young wine. It has dry tannins and a chewy texture that needs to soften.

1507,Château Troupian 2014  Haut-Médoc,"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away.",20.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116

1520,Château Pindefleurs 2013  Saint-Émilion,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,28.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
1524,Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure.

1589,Château Gaudin 2011  Pauillac,"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure.

1597,Domaine Beausejour 2014 Les Grenettes Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",15.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116
1600,Producta Vignobles 2013 Mission St. Vincent  (Bordeaux),"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",12.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116

1698,Gérard Bertrand 2008 L'Hospitalitas - La Clape Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth.

Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",50.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4367,Domaine de Cause 2012 Malbec (Cahors),"Red fruits and a bold color emphasize the fruitiness of this wine. It's ripe with some tannins that do need to soften; however, the explosive fruits are the stars here. Drink from 2017.",18.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4368,Domaine d'Escausses 2014 L'Ombre Fraîche White (Gaillac),"This comes from a complicated blend of Muscadelle, Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc: a touch from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Grapefruit and peach flavors bring out the best of the grapes, giving a wine that is both fresh and ripe. It is bright and tangy at the end. Drink from late 2017.",15.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4459,Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites  (Sancerre),"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink.",37.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4465,Château de la Roulerie 2011 Les Terrasses Chenin Blanc (Anjou),"Powerful and rich, this is a concentrated, wood-aged wine. It has toasted almonds as well as ripe pear and green-plum fruit. With a fine tension under the fruitiness, it will age over several years.",25.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4466,Château la Varière 2010 Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),"Full-bodied, fruity wine that has wood aging flavors along with red plum and strawberry fruits. Smoky, perfumed, this is a wine that shows fresh fruit with a good depth of flavor. Age for 2–3 years.",20.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4471,Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre),"Ripe black currant aromas set this wine on its full, warm path. It is intensely fruity with a rounded feel to it. The acidity cuts through the ripe character, giving tension and a piercing crisp aftertaste.",26.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4472,Domaine Seguin 2011  Pouilly-Fumé,"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together",29.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4481,Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere),"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",36.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
4483,Domaine Lignères 2003 La Baronne Red (Corbières),"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",11.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
4501,Château Teyssier 2006  Saint-Émilion,"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity.",30.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
4527,Château Haut-Logat 2010  Haut-Médoc,"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.",24.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4528,Château Suduiraut 2010 Castelnau de Suduiraut  (Sauternes),"Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017.",35.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4530,Domaine Ostertag 2013 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.",27.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4531,Domaine Schoffit 2011 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Riesling (Alsace),"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.",53.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4532,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kessler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Not overly sweet, this offers a spicy character on top of a touch of honey and fresh lemon flavors. It's surprisingly and attractively delicate for a Gewurztraminer, and ready to drink now.",38.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116

4569,Château du Coudray Montpensier 2013 Le Grand Bouqueteau  (Chinon),"The wine is all juicy fruit, black cherries with just a modicum of tannin to hold it together.

4573,Etienne de Tauriac 2010  Côtes de Bourg,"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016.",25.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4577,Pezat 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",15.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
4612,Trenel Fils 2015 Les Capitans  (Juliénas),"Named after the medieval rulers of the village, this cru wine is firm and structured in the solid style of the appellation. It has rich black cherry and black-plum fruits that come with juicy acidity. At the same time, the tannins and the dry core promise considerable aging. Drink from 2019.",25.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
4617,Château des Jacques 2015 Côte du Py  (Morgon),"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais. Drink from 2018.",43.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
4619,Domaine des Chers 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Saint-Amour),"The northernmost of the Beaujolais cru villages can produce wines that are Burgundian in their structure. This wine fits that profile well with its dark tannins and rich concentration. Densely textured with both black-cherry fruit and a dry core, the wine is taking its time to develop. Drink from late 2017 or 2018.",25.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
4634,Château Pontet-Canet 2000  Pauillac,"This is a very modern style of wine, with generous new wood and super-ripe fruit flavors, balancing with polished solid tannins. Very international in style, it is good, but could come from anywhere.",70.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4635,Clos Fourtet 2000  Saint-Émilion,"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.",51.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4645,Domaine Specht 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Bright fruit freshness dominates this wine. The fruit is pure, vivid. light and crisp. The acidity is important here, driving the wine in a mineral direction.",14.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4659,Domaine Saint Andrieu 2007 Red (Côtes de Provence),"Bright and woodsy, this Syrah-dominant red is intriguing for its tapestry of earth and mushroom flavors interwoven with mixed berry fruit. There's enough acidity in the medium, yeast-scented finish to stand up to hearty red meats. Drink up.",13.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4671,Château Moncontour 2012 Sec  (Vouvray),"A fruity wine, it's packed with citrus, freshly peeled apples and white peaches. Acidity cuts through the ripeness, giving total freshness at this stage.

4676,François Millet 2012 Domaine des Côtes Blanches  (Sancerre),"A full, fruity wine, it is ripe and finely textured. It also has a good chalky, mineral character, rich apple and grapefruit flavors and tight, dense acidity. It should be aged until 2015.",25.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
4689,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rich and full-bodied, this displays much of the complexity of a Grand Cru wine. It also has a strongly fruity character that bursts from the glass. Schoenenbourg is one of the vineyards surrounding the picture-book village of Riquewihr. Age the wine and drink from 2017.",40.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
4721,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2011  Cornas,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this négociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now–2025.",57.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4722,Clement et Florian Berthier 2014 Terre de Silex Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois),"From flinty soil, this wine shows a strongly mineral character and even a smoky edge.

4726,Domaine Pellé 2014 Les Blanchais  (Menetou-Salon),"From a separate parcel of old vines, this rich wine is structured and dense. Citrus and herbal flavors meld easily with the mineral texture and ripe green-plum fruits. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",34.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4737,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2014 La Dame de Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon),"Made from superripe grapes from old vines that have aged on lees, this is a rich, concentrated wine. Full-bodied yellow fruit and ripe pear flavors are sustained by the tight, steely mineral texture and the tangy aftertaste. This dense wine deserves to age until 2018.",26.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
4741,Trimbach 2010 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Intensely rich, this wine is packed with flavors of spice, gingerbread and lychees. It has a full, rounded character with an intense spiciness that is anchored to a more structured texture. Drink now and until 2018.",25.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
4748,Domaine Ostertag 2011 Barriques Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Aged in wood, this is an unusual style of Pinot Blanc for Alsace. The toast flavors are subtle, leaving plenty of room for fresh fruits, light acidity and creamy texture. It's ready to drink.",25.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
4749,Domaine Pfister 2011 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This is a light, fruity wine that's ripe with perfumed quince and tropical fruit flavors.

4794,Perrin & Fils 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"Like many of the Perrin & Fils wines, this one is firmly structured, its cherry and cocoa flavors ending on a dusty, tannic note. But the fruit is attractive, and even boasts some complexity in the wisps of garrigue on the nose. Probably best from 2013–2017.",15.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
4802,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2011 Cave de Saint-Roch les Vignes Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"An attractively balanced wine, this is ripe but fresh. The raspberry and orange fruits are vivid and well etched into the structure of the wine.",14.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116

4937,Domaine de la Sanglière 2012 Breezette Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Bright and crisp with just a touch of vanilla along with the more citrus character. The wine has red berry fruits, a light structure, fragrant, ready to drink.",18.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
4938,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2012 Vie Vité Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Full and rounded, this is a soft wine, more suited to food than as an aperitif.

4946,Château Lilian Ladouys 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance.

4994,Château Jolys 2009 Cuvée Jean  (Jurançon),"Honey flavored wine, packed with botrytis and also with intense acidity. That makes the wine light, dancing, while also showing richness. It is all so light, delicate, so delicious.",18.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116

5087,Château de Chatelard 2015 Cuvée Terre de Lumière  (Moulin-à-Vent),"Richly structured this wine, from well-exposed vines (hence the land of light in the name) is fruity with black cherry and some firm tannins.

5093,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine de Roche Noire  (Moulin-à-Vent),"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits.

5095,Chateau de Manissy 2015 Cuvée de Lys  (Tavel),"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017.",18.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
5117,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins.

5118,Château Potensac 2011  Médoc,"Coming from the same stable as Léoville las Cases in Saint-Julien, the wine is finely structured with firm tannins and dark fruit. Rich plum flavors are counterbalanced by solid tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",25.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
5138,Château Beaumont 2011  Haut-Médoc,"An impressive wine, it already shows signs of its potential. It is elegant, with ripe fruits and layers of dark tannins. As it opens, blackberry fruits come through strongly, balancing the firm structure. Drink from 2018.",20.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
5139,Château Larose Perganson 2011  Haut-Médoc,"Almost black in color, this is a solid, firm and ripe wine. It has a smooth wood character that is round and rich with black plum and berry fruit flavors. With its dark underlying texture, it will age, so drink from 2017.",40.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
5150,Château de Brigue 2015 Brique Prestige Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Almost white in color, this wine takes the Provence fashion for light rosé to extremes. To taste, yes, it is a rosé with a light tannic edge and red-currant flavors. The aftertaste with lime and lemon freshness is bright, emphasizing the clean fruitiness of the wine.",19.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
5153,Domaine de la Bégude 2014 Rosé (Bandol),"With 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits. Minerality and an herbal element come from the garrigue that surrounds the vines. The wine has certainly benefited from a year's aging.",30.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
5154,Domaine de la Vallongue 2015 Cuvée Garrigues Rosé (Les Baux de Provence),"Produced from organic grapes, this is a ripe, full and deliciously fruity wine.

5155,Domaines Ott 2015 Clos Mireille Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Set close to the sea (you can throw a stone into the water), this vineyard produces a fresh, almost salty wine, with a tight tang of citrus. It is perfumed, hinting at raspberries and pears. The aftertaste delivers a delicious, straight line of acidity.",52.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
5165,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Château Saint Hippolyte Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"The 20% of Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives structure, although a perfumed character dominates.

5182,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Leimental Riesling (Alsace),"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",35.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
5183,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",55.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
5184,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Terroir d'Alsace Riesling (Alsace),"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",30.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
5185,Domaines Ott 2014 Clos Mireille Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Ott specializes in rosés with weight and alcohol. Everything is so well integrated that they are only a part of a rich, fruity wine that has a dense texture, with spice and generous strawberry fruits.

5350,Château Marquis de Terme 2013  Margaux,This wine is solid and dense with probably too much extracted tannins. There are only hints of fruitiness.

5351,Château Saint-Corbian 2012 Cuvée Tradition  (Saint-Estèphe),"Firmly structured, this dark and dense wine packs a punch of tannins, giving a dry core.

5378,Kuentz-Bas 2013 White (Alsace),"At one moment there is a whiff of fresh apple, the next a hint of wet earth and orange peel. Brisk and dry, the palate also veers from rounded fruit to earthier, funkier notes. It finishes clean and refreshing.",12.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116

5521,Domaine des Baumard 2011  Quarts de Chaume,"Light while also intense with good acidity and unctuous honey flavors, this is already a delicious wine, even though it is young. Ripe orange and lemon go with the honey to give a fine wine that could be drunk now, although that would be a shame. It would be much better to wait until 2017. With just over 200 acres of vines, Quarts de Chaume is a tiny enclave in the Layon Valley.",80.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116

5545,Château de Cruzeau 2007  Pessac-Léognan,"With its ripe, yellow fruit flavors, this is a gentle, soft, open wine, which offers immediately pleasure.

5555,Le Grand Noir 2016 Black Sheep G-S-M (Pays d'Oc),"Dark cherry and berry fruits lead the nose of this rich and bramby wine, with hints of spicy chocolate and raspberry sauce lending added decadence.

5686,Cave de Cleebourg 2014 Symphonie en P Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish.",25.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
5692,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"An unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness. The lemon-balm note flashes here and there and the residual sugar frames notions of ripe Mirabelle plum beautifully. This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish.",34.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116

6848,Henry Fessy 2011 Nouveau  (Beaujolais),"Henry Fessy's can-can dancer is with us again on this bottle of red cherry fruity wine. There is a texture of acidity, the fruit attractively integrated. Soft tannins complete this fresh, fruity wine.",9.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
6888,Château Toumilon 2005  Graves,"Full, rounded and creamy, this is a fine, green plum- and white berry-flavored wine that has some good depth as well as fine floral aromas. It is lively and fresh, but with some richness.",20.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
6902,L'Egrégoire 2004  Bordeaux,"This is overpowering, almost too much. The fruit is so rich it feels overextracted, superjuicy and then hit with tannins and new wood. For those who like superconcentrated wines, this will be a big hit, but not with food.",60.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
6911,Bernard Magrez 2014 Château Tour Blanche  (Médoc),"This is an attractive, crisp and fruity wine. It has layers of wood that are already integrating well with the black-currant fruitiness. Tannins and a firm core are signs that the wine will age well. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",29.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6916,Château Abelyce 2011  Saint-Émilion,"From vines on the plain of Saint-Émilion, close to the Dordogne river, this is a ripe fruity wine. The tannins are already well integrated into the berry fruits, leaving just a dry core that is typical of the year. Drink the wine from 2018.",45.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6917,Château Bellevue Peycharneau 2013  Sainte-Foy Bordeaux,"On the slopes above the eastern Bordeaux town of Sainte-Foy, this vineyard produces some fine wines. Aged in new wood, the wine is rich in tannins, complex and serious. Bright red fruits and a firm structure both promise aging. Drink from 2018.",20.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6918,Château Haut Bertinerie 2014 Elegance  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"A light wood-aging flavor gives this wine its richness along with its fine ripe yellow fruits. Ripe and fruity from an excellent year for white Bordeaux, the wine is smooth and ready to drink.",17.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6919,Château le Prieuré 2014 Délice du Prieuré  (Saint-Émilion),"The second wine of Château le Prieuré, made from 100% pure juicy Merlot, is ripe and concentrated. It still has plenty of firm tannins although the rich fruits will balance out shortly. It is then going to be a generous wine with great final fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",27.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6920,Château Marquis de Terme 2014  Margaux,"A dense wine that is showing signs of heavy extraction, with dark chocolate and bitter flavors. In a vintage with crisp fruitiness being the defining factor, it is a bit of a shame. The dark edge needs to mellow before the wine can balance out.",35.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6921,Château Moncets 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,"The wine is firm and structured, showing more structure than fruit. It is solid, tight and with vanilla and blackberry fruits that are still behind the tannins. Probably this wine will remain firm, although the tannins should soften. Drink from 2018.",25.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6923,Domaine de la Bonne Tonne 2014 Côte de Py  (Morgon),"Organically grown grapes went into this perfumed wine. It is fruity, crisp with bright cherry flavors and lifted with acidity. The wine is still developing, still bringing its tannins to the fore. Drink from 2018.",28.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6932,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Chiroubles),"The vines around Chiroubles are some of the highest in Beaujolais. That gives wines with a structure, although here, this structure has been lost in the heavy fruit. It is very full, rich and with black-cherry flavors. Drink from 2017.",17.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
6934,Lion des Aubrots 2014  Côtes de Bourg,"Produced with organically grown grapes, the wine is firm, still tight and with ripe black fruits.

6962,Ferraton Pere et Fils 2014 Les Miaux Marsanne (Hermitage),"This is rich, honeyed and ripe on the nose and full-bodied and round in the mouth, with just enough acidity to provide backbone and length.

6963,Mas Champart 2013 Causse du Bousquet Red (Saint-Chinian),"A blend of 74% Syrah, 10% Carignan, 6% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsault, this is an elegant and harmonious wine.

With its crushed-velvet texture, bold fruit flavors and lingering spice accents, the wine is easy to appreciate and enjoy now, yet structured enough to age well for another 6–10 years.",25.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
6965,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Smooth, silky and ready to drink, this medium- to full-bodied wine is a fine choice to go with nearly any red-meat dish.

6977,Georges Vigouroux 2011 Château de Haute-Serre Cuvée Prestige Malbec (Cahors),"Produced only in good years, this wine comes from selected parcels in the Haute-Serre vineyard. With eucalyptus perfumes, it is a smooth and wood-aged wine. The smoothness masks the powerful tannins that are beginning to balance with the rich black fruits. This dense wine needs to age. Drink from 2019.",49.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
7008,Fournier Père et Fils 2008 La Charnivolle  (Menetou-Salon),"Very soft, ripe grapefruit and kumquat flavors, lifted by acidity. The wine is broad, full in the mouth, crispness well integrated. Great final fruit.",23.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
7042,Billecart-Salmon 2006 Vintage Extra Brut  (Champagne),"Billecart-Salmon's style is dry, so an Extra Brut will be almost bone-dry. This wine is crisp and tight, bringing out grapefruit and citrus flavors and a steely, mineral character. It is still young, with freshness dominant, and needs to mature to blossom into a very fine Champagne. Drink from 2018.",85.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
7045,Joseph Perrier 2004 Cuvée Josephine Brut  (Champagne),"This top wine from Joseph Perrier is rich, full in the mouth and well balanced. It is at the midway point of Brut, neither too sweet nor dry, giving ripe, creamy apple flavors and refreshing, concentrated acidity. There is no sign yet of maturity, the wine still so fresh. Drink now for the liveliness or wait until 2018 for maturity.",150.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
7046,Ruinart 2002 Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"From a great Champagne vintage, this rich, full-bodied wine is just beginning to develop secondary flavors, toast and walnuts. The red fruits are fading into the background, while keeping the acidity in place. It is ripe, well balanced and has a delicious, long aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",286.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
7052,Taittinger 2006 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"The lively mousse carries this sophisticated wine, which is the perfect partner to the Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs. Everything is in its place, well integrated and with great precision. This trends to the sweeter side of Brut but with bottle age this has brought fine secondary flavors that are ripe and rich. The wine will age further, drink until 2020.",262.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
7080,Château la Petite Roque 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"The wine has some of the typical freshness of 2011 but it seems on the thin side.

7081,Château le Castellot 2006 L'Excellence  (Montravel),Offers a glimpse of a fully mature wine from Bergerac. It has retained strong and dense tannins that are showing signs of drying the wine. The tough core is not likely to go away. Drink now.,60.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116

7147,Château Coussin 2014 La Croix du Prieur Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Sumeire family, Coussin's second wine is tangy, textured and with lively acidity. The texture is as important as the fruit, giving a mineral edge to the acidity. The red fruits finish with an attractive lift.",20.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
7149,Château Paradis 2014 White (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"This wine is a fresh, herbaceous and fruity blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Grenache Blanc.

7174,Château La Nerthe 2008 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"La Nerthe's late-ripening Mourvèdre typically shines the brightest in warm vintages, which 2008 was not. The result is a leathery, peppery wine with rather crisp, cherry-inflected fruit. Drink it over the next several years.",50.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
7175,Clerget 2008 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"A bit anonymous, but for a big-production négoce blend from a difficult vintage, you could do a lot worse. Plums and black cherries predominate, but tinges of cinnamon and earth peek through. Tannins are soft; drink now.",25.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
7176,Domaine Pierre Usseglio et Fils 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Plummy and savory, this plump, supple-textured wine is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre. It offers an easygoing mouthful of fruit in an early-drinking style.",25.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116

7216,Vignerons de Bel Air 2013 Eté Intense  (Côte de Brouilly),"The wine has weight and richness while also showing considerable acidity and dry tannic structure. It's firm, the fruitiness showing slowly through the mineral texture. It will be better in 2015.",17.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116

7224,Domaine de Ménard 2013 Colombard-Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne),"Intensely fruity, this delicious, ripe wine explodes with fresh acidity and fragrant fruitiness. Apricots, lemon and juicy apples give a fruit salad of flavors. Drink through 2015.",10.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
7225,Domaine des Marrans 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"The wine is so young, it almost has a prickle on the tongue. It is very fresh and still rather tight with acidity and crisp berry fruits. Wait until 2015 for this fruity wine to settle down and open up.",17.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
7226,Domaine Dupeuble Père et Fils 2012  Beaujolais,"The year's bottle aging has rounded this wine out and has softened the fresh red fruits into a more generous, full-bodied texture. The acidity, always present shows as a counterpoint to the ripe fruits. Drink now.",15.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
7227,Domaine Lagneau 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"Bold and fruity, this is packed with cherries as well as acidity. A plum skin texture gives structure to this still closed-up wine. Wait until 2015.",15.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
7242,Château Haut Bertinerie 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This rich, concentrated wine is velvet smooth, with tannins enveloped by ripe berry and plum fruits.

7245,Château Joanin Bécot 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"The wine has serious tannins and firm fruit that give an austere character at this stage. But it will develop and round out into a rich wine with ripe black fruits, always with a solid tannic structure. Owner Juliette Bécot manages the technical side here with consultant Jean-Philippe Fort from the Michel Rolland lab, and manages marketing at classed-growth Château Beauséjour-Bécot in nearby Saint-Émilion.",15.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
7246,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2012 Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Big and juicy, this is an attractive blend of 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec with a promising future.

7314,Château Petit Moulin 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This is a tight, mineral-textured wine. Crisp fruit keeps it bright, but the texture adds a more serious, structured note. Wait until late 2017 for it to come completely together.",12.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
7351,Château Thieuley 2007 Cuvée Francis Courselle  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Thieuley's vineyard is on a ridge in the heart of Entre-deux-Mers.

7359,Château Moncontour 2005 Cuvée Prédilection Brut  (Vouvray),"One of the best sparkling Vouvrays, this 2005 vintage has an extra richness from the year. It has the mineral, chalky edge of Chenin Blanc, but this is rounded out with pear, white peach and sweet almond flavors. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 2–3 years.",19.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
7374,J. Dumangin Fils 1996 Vinothèque Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"From the legendary 1996 vintage, this is a bottling that only received its dosage in 2012.

7392,Domaine de la Tour du Bon 2010 Red (Bandol),"This wine introduces itself with intense acidity and freshness, opening the palate to red berry flavors and tannins that are integrating well. It's a wine for medium-term aging. Drink from 2015.",35.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116

7429,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",91.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
7444,Château d'Aqueria 2015  Tavel,"The 2015s Tavels are almost uniformly excellent, so it's no surprise that this bottling, from a large estate excels.

7473,Wolfberger 2012 Riesling (Alsace),"This is an attractive wine that maintains the steely texture of Riesling while also bringing out fragrant white flowers and refreshing fruitiness. It has a light touch of acidity, making it exceptionally adept with food.",18.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116

7508,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2012 Clos du Zahnacker White (Alsace),"A very soft but distinctly pure nose of ripe, yellow-pear flesh perfumes everything. The palate enters with far more texture than expected and girdles the fruit with phenolic grip, brightened by fresh acidity. The faintest slick of residual sugar boosts the fruit notes towards the dry finish. The pear notes linger beautifully.",33.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
7515,Maurice Schoech & Fils 2012 Harmonie R White (Alsace),"With a bit of air, ripe and mellow apple notes appear. These seem to be burgeoning and rich, ready to spill and splash along with notes of peach and dried pear. A phenolic, rich texture and fresh acidity keep them all in check. There is lots of interesting conflict in this glass. Let the drama play out on your tongue.",60.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
7559,Gustave Lorentz 2014 Riesling (Alsace),The lemony freshness that the nose promises is slightly unbalanced on the bright palate but the flavors are clean and invigorating. This easydrinking wine would make a perfect party apéritif.,24.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
7568,E. Guigal 2006  Hermitage,"This is the current release from Guigal, which makes it one of the few Hermitages on store shelves that's ready to drink.

Instead, it delivers beefy notes of coffee, black olive and spice, backed by hints of raspberries and cedar.",90.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
7579,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Thalabert  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood.

8178,Château Castera 2011  Médoc,Ripe plum fruits give this big and fruity wine from the 130-acre Castéra vineyard a rich character.

8179,Château Gramond 2011  Haut-Médoc,"Powerfully tannic, this dense and firm wine is dark in both color and fruit flavors.

8189,Domaine Zinck 2011 Terroir Muscat (Alsace),"There should be more Muscat planted in Alsace if this fine wine is anything to go by.

8210,Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux 2012  Moulis-en-Médoc,"This is turning into an impressive wine as it finds its way between solid tannins and ripe, full black fruits.

8211,Château Villemaurine 2012  Saint-Émilion,"This solid and powerful wine comes from a chateau right in the walls of Saint-Émilion. A dense texture brings out tannins and the wood-aging flavors.

8249,Château Lacombe Noaillac 2010  Médoc,"Stalky black currant fruit dominates this wood-aged wine. The black fruits are fresh, although with a stern structure of Cabernet Sauvignon. It need a year to develop.",18.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8254,Gérard Bertrand 2010 Gris Blanc Rosé (Pays d'Oc),"This is a very easygoing and drinkable rosé, with faint aromas and flavors of strawberry hull, ripe white cranberry and a touch of hard peach flesh. Overall, it's balanced and approachable, but also very light; pair with lighter fare.",15.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8261,Le Cirque 2010 Rosé (Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes),"A vibrant pink hue in the glass, this rosé has nice ripe fruit aromas of wild strawberry and fresh cherry that follow through to the juicy, red fruit-dominating mouth. Round and full, the rich mouth could use a bit more cut.",14.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8262,Château de Jau 2008 Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages),"Lean red fruit and sweet spice aromas lead the way on the bouquet of this blend, made from 45% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache and 15% Carignan.

8273,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2005 Réserve Spéciale  (Bordeaux),"A structured, firm wine showing a great balance of red fruits, dry Bordeaux-style tannins and a freshly jammy texture. For a branded Bordeaux, it has both quality and elegance.",14.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
8285,Château Peyrabon 2014  Haut-Médoc,"Owned by the Bernard family who also own one of the major Bordeaux negociants, Millésima, the wine is structured, deliciously fruity and with a series of smoky tannins that will allow it to age. It comes from a vineyard close to Pauillac and that shows in the dense Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its weight. Drink from 2021.",17.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
8290,Domaine Charles Baur 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin. The characteristic 2014 freshness makes this bright and sprightly and creates an off-dry finish to the concentrated palate.",35.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
8299,Joseph Cattin 2015 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"On the nose, luscious peach notes are slightly muddied by earthier notes. On the palate, generous sweetness boosts all the fruit flavors to an intense lusciousness. There is balance in the form of lemony freshness and a lovely tangy texture. This is momentarily quite intense.",35.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
8310,Dopff & Irion 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.,28.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
8322,Vignerons de Bel Air 2014 Les Crêtes  (Beaujolais-Villages),"Still young, this wine has considerable acidity that is surprising. Its cherry fruits are fresh with soft tannins and a juicy aftertaste. It needs another six months to calm down. Drink from summer 2016.",13.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8327,Domaine D'en Ségur 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Tarn),"This is a ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc wine.

8340,Domaine des Terrisses 2015 Doux Mauzac (Gaillac),"This intensely fresh wine is a blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah in a textured, stalky style that is tight and layered with tannins. It's certainly young, still bursting with fruit and needing to fill out as its tannins soften and its black currant fruit calms down. Then it will be a fascinating, complex wine, elegant and poised. Drink from 2018.",17.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8347,Les Vins de Vienne 2011 L'Arzelle  (Saint-Joseph),"All of LVV's 2011 Saint-Joseph's are impressive.

8359,M. Chapoutier 2011 Chante-Alouette Marsanne (Hermitage),"This is the most impressive Chante-Alouette I can recall, boasting layers of honeyed pineapple fruit, the barest hint of fresh, just-golden toastiness and notes of gingered apricot. It's full bodied and lush on the palate, ending long and mouthwatering. It should drink well into 2015, but expect it to close up only to re-emerge between 2020 and 2030.",109.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
8387,Ogier 2013 Héritages Elevé en Foudres de Chêne Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.",16.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116
8425,Château Grand Boise 2015 Cuvée Jadis Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"The top rosé from old vines at Grand Boise, this is a ripe, well-structured and balanced wine.

8442,Château Coussin 2015 Cuvée César à Sumeire Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),"The bottle carries the signature of French sculptor César, who marked his friendship with the Sumeire family, owners of the estate.

8443,Château d'Esclans 2014 Garrus Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Always aged for a year before it is released, this iconic wine is impressive. It is superrich without losing freshness.

8446,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière 2015 Confidentielle Rosé (Côtes de Provence La Londe),"A portion of this estate is in the cru appellation of La Londe, based on schist soil. This single-vineyard wine is impressive in its ripe fruit and vein of fresh acidity. It is full bodied and concentrated, while keeping a light touch. It is dry, lightly structured and likely will be even better from the end of 2016.",46.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
8463,Château Nozières 2011 Malbec (Cahors),"Earthy in character, this is a rustic wine. It does have attractive red fruits, and balancing acidity but these elements come up against a barnyard character and firm tannins.",13.0,83,3,0.9917289317502116

8489,Château de Ferrand 2012  Saint-Émilion,"With a dominance of Merlot in the blend, this Saint-Émilion-classed growth has ripe, jammy fruits and softening tannins.

8508,Château d'Esclans 2007 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Dominated by toasty, coconutty aromas, with just hints of peach and hazelnut. Hold six months and see what emerges; right now, this wine is defined more by technique (barrel-fermentation and aging) than terroir.",80.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
8561,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2009 Burlenberg Red (Alsace),"There is an appealing rusticity and a certain wildness about this wine. Hints of smoke and singed meat makes it visceral and unusual. Red fruit lurks here and there between the earthier notes and there also is a grip of firm, but unforced tannin. It's full of rugged, swarthy charm and secretive, intriguing depth.",33.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
8577,Château du Cèdre 2014 Malbec (Cahors),"This wine is ripe in spicy black-currant aromas on the nose and intense in juicy black fruit on the dense palate.

8579,Château Tour des Gendres 2015 Les Anciens Francs Parcelle A252 Cabernet Franc (Côtes de Bergerac),"A smoky perfume marks this young wine immediately as Cabernet Franc.

8581,Domaine Rotier 2014 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),"Get to know the local red grapes of Gaillac that make up this blend: Duras, Braucol and Prunelard.

8621,Château Vincens 2011 Origine Malbec (Cahors),"Almost black in color, this is a dark-hued, black plum and chocolate flavored wine.

8631,Château Vincens 2011 Prestige Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"A rich, Port-like wine that is full and concentrated while also soft and fruity.

8638,Château de Gaudou 2011 Réserve Caillou Malbec (Cahors),"A dark, dense wine that comes from a parcel of old vines. It's a solid, supremely tannic wine at this young stage, but that black fruitiness will push through over the next few years. Great swathes of juicy acidity, tannins and fruit, all impressive potential. Drink from 2018.",40.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
8639,Domaine Pichot 2011 Les Larmes de Bacchus  (Vouvray),"A gold-colored, supremely rich wine produced from a selection of grapes in the vineyard.

8641,Domaine Joël Delaunay 2013 Le Grand Ballon Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire),"A ripe wine, blended from fruit from across Touraine, this lively, smooth wine has a touch of sweetness at the end. That makes for a wine that's ready to drink with a soft aftertaste.",13.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
8642,Producteurs Plaimont 2013 Colombelle L'Originel White (Côtes de Gascogne),"A blend of Colombard and Ugni Blanc, this crisp, light wine is as fresh as a daisy.

8651,Marquis de Goulaine 2013 Le Puy Ferrand Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Showing its youthful side, this is a breathtakingly fresh wine with intense acidity and tight grapefruit flavors. It's the style of Muscadet that really needs to soften for a few months and round out, when it will be very drinkable.",13.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
8655,Georges Vigouroux 2012 Petit Jammes Malbec (Cahors),A light and fruity style of Malbec that emphasizes the red fruits and freshness that is possible with this often-tannic grape. The wine is designed to be drunk young and this bottling is totally ready to go.,17.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116

8769,Alain Jaume et Fils 2015 Domiane Grand Veneur Blanc de Viognier (Côtes du Rhône),"Relatively restrained for Viognier, with attractive fruit notes of muskmelon, apricot and pineapple, but not much more in the way of complexity. It's medium bodied, with a long, refreshing finish that hints at white pepper. Drink now.",25.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116
8806,Domaine Coustarret 2012 Le Barou  (Jurançon),"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019.",39.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
8811,Château Lagrézette 2013 Paragon Terroir de Massaut Malbec (Cahors),"A new wine for Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrézette, this comes from a single vineyard on mainly gravel soil.

8815,Domaine de Cause 2013 La Lande Cavagnac Malbec (Cahors),"This wood-aged, perfumed wine is serious, complex and will take its time to develop.

It will be ready to drink from 2019.",40.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
8840,Vignerons de Bel Air 2016 Bel-Air  (Beaujolais-Villages),"This soft wine is fruity, spicy and full of juicy red fruits. It offers plenty of acidity as well as a layer of tannins. An easy, open wine, it is ready to drink.",13.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8861,Château du Carrubier 2014 Red (Côtes de Provence),"This firm and tannic wine is more structure than fruit. It is dense with a dry core. The acidity suggests that there may be some fruit there, although the rest of the wine is ready to drink.",19.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
8876,Domaine de Dauliac 2015 Malbec (Cahors),"Organically cultivated vines, some over 80-years-old, on the upper terraces above the river Lot are behind this firmly structured, concentrated wine. With solid tannins as well as the potential of black fruits, it is young and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2020.",25.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
8886,Léon Perdigal 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is a juicy, medium- to full-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Mourvèdre. Berry-like fruit picks up some herbal, tea-like notes on the finish, creating mouthwatering tension. Drink now.",15.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
8889,Mailly Grand Cru 2008 Les Echansons  (Champagne),"The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintage—this is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine.",160.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8891,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",78.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8892,Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.",60.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8893,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 2017–2037.",29.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8894,Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",60.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8895,Julien Schaal 2016 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Glorious and utterly enticing notes of peach hover on the nose. They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate. It's a most unusual and most beguiling Riesling with incredible appeal and potential. Drink 2017–2040.",45.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116
8896,Kuentz-Bas 2015 Geisberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise.

8897,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate.

8898,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040.",120.0,96,3,0.9917289317502116

8905,Domaine Ostertag 2015 A360P Muenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power.

8906,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.",120.0,95,3,0.9917289317502116
8907,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully.

8910,Jean Biecher & Fils 2016 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last.

8911,Julien Schaal 2016 Rosacker Grand Cru Calcaire Riesling (Alsace),"A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin.

8918,Cave de Turckheim 2015 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses.

9410,Domaine du Moulin Berger 2007 Vayolette  (Juliénas),"Ripe red fruits are aided by a core of dark tannin to give this wine good intensity. There is acidity, followed by bubbling fruit, topped with berries and spice. Worth keeping until next year.",20.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116

9474,Château Les Bertrands 2015 Nectar Des Bertrands  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"New wood aromas lead this toasty wine that has spice, high toast flavors and the smallest hint of fruit.

9516,Château Roubine 2015 Inspire Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Unusually, Tibouren (a red grape more often found further east near Nice) forms part of the blend of this wine along with white Clairette.

9517,Château Sainte Marguerite 2015 Symphony Rosé (Côtes de Provence La Londe),"This is a soft, pepper and red-fruit-flavored wine. Crisp acidity is well integrated into the tangy, mineral texture.

9538,Domaine de la Bégude 2014 L'Irréductible Rosé (Vin de France),"Although this is labeled as Vin de France, its fruit comes from the La Bégude estate in Bandol. With one year's aging, it is full, soft and ripe with generous strawberry flavors. Dark in color, it may not follow the trend in Provence for pale rosés and its taste is rich and full bodied. The acidity at the end gives the necessary freshness.",40.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116

9564,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2010 Mouton Cadet  (Bordeaux),"This is a toasty, black-currant-fruited wine. Its structural tannins give a dry character. A touch of green herb and a hard edge of toast indicate that the wine needs another year to soften.",10.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116

9590,Albert Besombes 2016 Vallée des Rois Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),The wine has bitterness from the intense acidity and herbal character.

9644,Château du Cèdre 2007 Le Cèdre Malbec (Cahors),"High toast aromas are filled out on the palate with rich, concentrated fruit and bitter chocolate flavors.

9655,Domaine les Cantates 2012 Roussanne (Chignin-Bergeron),"This is an attractive, fruity, creamy wine that's full of rich yellow and white fruits.

9698,Vignerons de Buxy 2015 Buissonnier  (Coteaux Bourguignons),This blend of Gamay and Pinot Noir is soft and ripe with red fruits. The wine is all fruit: red cherry and raspberry with a light touch of spice and tannins. The wine is ready to drink.,15.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
9701,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2004 Bergheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Asian spice and developed bready notes dominate the nose of this mature example.

9729,Lafage 2005 Les Onze Terrasses Red (Côtes du Roussillon Les Aspres),"This blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Grenache and 5% Carignan is aging beautifully, and still shows great life ahead.

9730,Domaine Calvet-Thunevin 2008 Les Trois Marie Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages),"Despite the age, this still drinks quite young and tight, with firm tannins and a gripping structure framed against a fleshy black-fruit center. Rich and dense notes of blackberry, boysenberry and plum are laced with hints of cigar spice, licorice and toasted vanilla, and a sweet-wood sensation stays through the long finish. Big in almost every regard, this should continue to age well through 2016.",50.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
9731,Château Avernus 2005 Tautavel Red (Côtes du Roussillon),"This blend of 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 30% Carignan and 10% Mourvèdre is not showing its true age. Sure, it boasts some developed notes of charcuterie, balsamic herb and garrigue, but it's also still brimming with full, ripe black-fruit notes of plum and berry. With a crushed velvet texture, gripping tannins and a long, heady finish that's laced with hints of espresso and vanilla, this shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Enjoy now, or try after 2016.",39.0,91,3,0.9917289317502116
9754,Château Haut-Monplaisir 2012 Malbec (Cahors),"Ripe, almost sweet, fruit is full of delicious black plum and berry flavors. The wine is rounded, opulent and generous to a fault. A solid core of darker tannins hold all this richness together. Drink from 2015.",19.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
9756,Domaine du Fief aux Dames 2010 Monnières-Saint-Fiacre  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"This comes from a single vineyard that is owned by several growers but whose fruit is made into a single wine. It is rich, ripe and fruity, a powerful and full-bodied Muscadet. It has spice as well as citrus fruitiness and a rounded texture.

9763,Georges Vigouroux 2011 Château de Haute-Serre Grand Vin Seigneur Malbec (Cahors),"Haute-Serre is high on the plateau above the Lot river. It produces wines that are structured with complex tannins and an austere fruit character. This 2011 is in that mold. It has acidity as well as juicy black fruits, plus striated tannins that are in the process of being smoothed by the wood aging. Drink from 2018.",25.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
9771,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2015 Le Grand Roc  (Sancerre),"Still young, this rich, lightly honeyed and intensely ripe wine is beautifully structured. It has swathes of apricot, citrus and gooseberry fruits as well as a dense concentrated texture. The wine is certainly in need of aging. Drink from 2019.",40.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9773,Cave de Hunawihr 2016 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A subtle touch of lemon appears first. On the palate, this is amplified with lemony zest and brightness. Wonderfully dry and light, with a singing, illuminating freshness, this enlivens the palate and puts a spring in your step. There is concentration but also a wonderfully light touch. This is dry and utterly invigorating with a bracing, long and vivid finish of pure lemon. Drink 2017–2030.",25.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9774,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2013 Altenberg-Bergbieten Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027.",80.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9780,Domaine Zinck 2015 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A tropical whiff of passion fruit hovers enticingly on the nose. A touch of this also clings aromatically to the taut palate where concentrated citrus notes of orange, lemon and tangerine dominate. This is resolutely dry and bouncingly fresh with precision, fruit and verve. The finish is totally refreshing and lip-smacking.",49.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9781,Dopff Au Moulin 2015 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A lick of lemon tanginess plays on the nose alongside a touch of peach. The palate reprises this lemon freshness and lets it dance softly on the fluid, dry palate. Peach and mirabelle can be glimpsed, too. This is dry and fresh, clean and vivid, leaving the palate cleansed and refreshed. The lemon echoes long, joined by zesty grapefruit on the finish, and makes this totally moreish.",28.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9792,Willm 2012 Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Clos Gaensbroennel Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A funky smoky notion of yeast clings to the nose on which a pure lemon streak becomes apparent. A generous, luscious and almost creamy sweetness then conquers the palate, boosting all of the fruit flavors, wrapping them in its creamy mellow embrace. The pure lemon streak counters and brightens the richness and around the edges there is grapefruit spice. This is all rather beguiling but not overdone. The finish is moreish, medium sweet and long.",29.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
9795,Besserat de Bellefon 2008 Cuvée des Moines Brut Millésime  (Champagne),"Dominated by rich Chardonnay, this is a ripe wine.

9803,L. Tramier & Fils 2014 Collection  (Côte de Brouilly),"A soft and fruity wine, this is ripe with dark cherry and spice flavors. A hint of bananas from the fermentation spoils the rest of the ripe fruitiness of this ready-to-drink wine.",18.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
9804,La Fleur Ribeyrolles 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers,"It is the high proportion of perfumed Sauvignon Gris in this wine that creates its ripe, smooth and rich character. It brings in a calming, rounding influence to the more herbal Sauvignon Blanc and will allow it to develop a creamy character as it develops. Drink from summer 2017.",13.0,86,3,0.9917289317502116
9806,Château Champ du Moulin 2015  Bordeaux,"Produced from organically grown grapes, this is a ripe, easy and fruity wine. It has light tannins, juicy black-currant fruit and acidity.

9809,Cheval Quancard 2014 Fortin Plaisance  (Saint-Émilion),"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture.

9832,Domaine de Nalys 2009 Réserve Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Atypical for the appellation in that it's 80% Syrah, this is a dark-fruited, slightly pruny Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Chocolate and licorice notes add complexity to this full-bodied, firmly structured wine. With its long, chewy finish, consider deferring consumption until at least 2014.",68.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
9834,Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Guy Louis Red (Côtes du Rhône),"More Tardieu-Laurent than Côtes du Rhône, with hallmark exotic, nearly tropical notes suggestive of toasted coconut, vanilla and apricot.

9837,Château de la Jaubertie 2010 Mirabelle de la Jaubertie White (Bergerac Sec),"This wood-aged wine shows equal notes of toasty spice and ripe fruit.

9863,Henri Bourgeois 2015 La Chapelle des Augustins  (Sancerre),"This is an intensely herbal wine. Its high alcohol doesn't take away from its green fruit, gooseberry and cool taste. Perhaps it does increase the intensity of all these elements, producing a wine that is both rich and also taut and mineral. It does seem to need more aging, so drink from 2018.",35.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116

9898,Domaine Chiroulet 2011 Grande Réserve Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Both the aromas and the palate shout out the wood aging that's been used in this wine. It is still young and the spice and burnt toast character should soften further into the ripe blackberry fruits. The texture is certainly concentrated and firm; a wine with a good future. Drink from 2017.,20.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116
9924,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 1998  Graves,"This one comes from the Mouton branch of the Rothschilds. Showing its age a bit already, with mature apple and wood varnish aromas that perk up a bit on the palate, where they pick up some attractive lemon nuances.",14.0,82,3,0.9917289317502116
9928,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 1999 Mouton Cadet  (Bordeaux Blanc),"A famous old brand that seems to be living off past glory, this year's edition is quite neutral in aroma and flavor; you have to work to pick out some mild herb and citrus, but it does show a nice spicy, green-peppercorn character on the finish.",11.0,81,3,0.9917289317502116
9929,Michel Lynch 1998  Bordeaux,"The nose features some plum and faint cedar aromas, but not a lot of intensity; the light black-cherry and cedar flavors incorporate some earthy nuances on the finish. Light and correct, but where's the beef?",9.0,81,3,0.9917289317502116
9932,Seigneurs de Bergerac 1999 White (Bergerac),A white this age should be fresh and crisp; this one is a bit dull and shows only faint bitter lemon flavors on the finish to go with tired apple aromas.,8.0,80,3,0.9917289317502116
9933,Mont Tauch 1998 Red (Fitou),"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable.",11.0,80,3,0.9917289317502116

10045,Nicolas Gaudry 2014  Pouilly-Fumé,"Perfumed green fruits, a crisp texture and layers of tight acidity all point to a wine that is too young to drink. Its hints of ripe white fruits and tangy orange peel are still developing. Drink from 2017.",28.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
10061,Fournier Père et Fils 2014 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),"This ripe wine is full of citrus fruit, gooseberry flavors and fully integrated acidity.

10165,Maison Bouey 2011 Cuvée  (Bordeaux),"This is a wine that is totally dominated by wood. So much so that there is little sign of fruit. Maybe it will integrate, but there is a question mark.",15.0,82,3,0.9917289317502116

10190,Château Laronde Désormes 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a generous, full-bodied wine that shows the ripe fruit of the vintage. The fruit appears upfront, offering a warm mouthfeel, and the tannic structure is likely to allow it to age.",25.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116

10903,Château Sansey 2007  Graves,"A wine that seems to be all tannin, all wood, with only a feel of black currant fruits underneath all this dryness. These flavors suggest high extraction, giving spice, a high toast wood character, all too much for a delicate 2007.",11.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116
10917,Château d'Arcins 2006  Haut-Médoc,"This tastes lean, the fruit buried deep beneath hard, dry fruit tannins. There is an old style austerity here that demands food. The final juicy acidity does leave a welcome relief.",24.0,84,3,0.9917289317502116

10958,Château Monbrison 2000  Margaux,"Thanks to the total dedication of owner Jean-Luc Vonderheyden, Monbrison continued to perform outside its class in 2000.

11598,Jean-Luc Baldès 2012 Elegant Malbec (Cahors),"The latest releases from Clos Triguedina aim to create wines for early drinking.

It's firmly structured, with gripping tannins and a faint cocoa accent to the dry finish.",21.0,88,3,0.9917289317502116
13476,Château Beaubois 2009 Confidence Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Unlike most Costières de Nîmes, this is 95% Grenache, giving it a round, expansive mouthfeel and soft tannins. Warm baking spices complement black cherry fruit. Drink now–2015.",18.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116
13486,Domaine de Billards 2009  Saint-Amour,"With some firm tannins and considerable red fruit juiciness, this is a wine that combines a good fruity character with a solid structure. The balancing side is the acidity and very fresh finish.",21.0,89,3,0.9917289317502116
13546,Charlier & Fils 2005 Special Club Brut  (Champagne),"This is one of a collection of Champagnes tasted and approved by a group of growers under the Special Club label. With a predominance of Chardonnay, it's still crisp and fruity, showing rich apple and pear flavors. Its citrusy acidity gives it lift, slowing any signs of maturity. It will continue to age gracefully but is delicious now.",56.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
13586,Château Plaisance 2006  Bordeaux Supérieur,"A firm, dry textured wine, with tannins that are now losing more fruity character. It needs at least an hour in a decanter to show its more balanced nature. Ready to drink.",18.0,87,3,0.9917289317502116
13597,Domaine Berthoumieu 2012 Vitis MCM Tannat (Madiran),"Produced from vines planted in 1900 (MCM in Roman numerals), this is a serious, major wine. It is so concentrated with its dark tannins yet never loses its elegant balance between fruit and structure.

13600,Alain Brumont 2010 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age.

13649,De Venoge 2006 Louis XV Brut  (Champagne),"In its distinctive carafe-shaped bottle, this Champagne commemorates the French king who first said that Champagne had to be bottled (so the bubbles would not disappear). It is dominated by Chardonnay, giving a chalky, mineral texture to this ripe wine. While the fruit is still deliciously fresh, the wine is just beginning to add toast flavors to its repertoire. Drink now, or better from 2017.",153.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
13651,Domaine Fernand Engel 2010 Trilogie Dosage Zero Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"A golden color and a nose of honeyed evolution, reminiscent of fresh field mushrooms and chalk already hint at a vintage wine. The palate surprises with the most gentle, generous and balmy fruit, like an essence of peach, without resorting to any sweetness added by dosage. Its fruity freshness is truly astonishing. This is an evolved, gloriously fresh testament to what Crémant d'Alsace can be. This might work better alongside food than as an apéritif. In any case: let it speak to you and savor the long finish.",40.0,93,3,0.9917289317502116
13655,Bruno Paillard 2008 Assemblage Extra Brut  (Champagne),"With seven years on lees before disgorgement, this wine already shows some maturity. It is rich while also having the intense acidity of the vintage.

13741,Château Cadillac 2009 Cuvée J.J. Lesgourges  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"As its 14.5% indicates, this is a particularly rich wine.

13798,Domaine de Fondrèche 2014 Red (Ventoux),"In a vintage that yielded some attractive, supple wines, this wine stands out for its extraction and toughness. Chocolate, plum and clove notes are framed by firm tannins that come across gritty and hard on the finish.",20.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116

13820,Domaine de Vaugondy 2015 Sec  (Vouvray),"This ripe, complex wine offers a delicate combination of apple, lemon and honey, with a mineral texture.

13825,Henri Bourgeois 2015 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre),"From vines between 20 and 40 years old, this is a ripe, intense wine with great acidity.

Drink now.",18.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
13841,Les Astéries 2012  Saint-Émilion,"Very structured and packed with tannins, this has the weight to balance those qualities, promising layers of black fruits as it develops.

13852,Domaine Zinck 2015 Portrait Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A flinty note appears first, but juicy pear and ripe lemon take over. This wine is zippy, refreshing and defined on the palate.

13853,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Turckheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Subtle notes of concentrated rose petals and almost smoky honeysuckle come with a flinty aspect. The palate is defined by pithy lemon and bergamot interspersed with aromatic spices like lemon pepper and cardamom. It is the zesty core, however, that draws you in, with pithy grapefruit notes that last along with the fruity spice.",26.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
13878,Domaine Cazes 1999 Ambré Vin Doux Naturel Biodynamie Grenache Blanc (Rivesaltes),"Though this is in its infancy now, it's hard to pass up. Attractive notes of dried peach, golden raisin, orange marmalade and toasted almond are kept in check by mature oxidative and wood tones as well as a bright seam of rancio. It's delicious and well balanced, though more time in the cellar will allow it to develop additional layers of complexity.",35.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
13880,Château Eugénie 2014 Cuvée Tsar Pierre le Grand Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"Densely structured and full of dusty tannins as well as perfumed black fruits, this wine is named after Russian Tsar Peter the Great.

13903,Louis Roederer 2009 Brut Rosé  (Champagne),The latest vintage of Roederer Rosé shows all the finesse of which this producer is capable. It has fruit and the merest touches of bottle age.

13920,Jean-Luc Baldès 2012 Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine  Malbec (Cahors),"This wine recreates the medieval technique used to cook the fermenting must to make it more stable. In this case, it also produces a wine that is almost black in color, dark in appearance and in flavor. There is also some elegance here, with fine tannins that are well integrated into the juicy black fruits and ripe character. It's a wine to age, although it is juicy enough to drink now. Best, though, from 2018.",50.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14000,Château de Chambert 2010 Malbec (Cahors),"Black in color, this dense wine has power, concentration and a hugely tannic structure. Still in its infancy, it is darkly dominated by its dry, firm texture, the black fruits still hiding behind the framework and the acidity. Give this complex wine until 2018 before drinking.",19.0,92,3,0.9917289317502116
14001,Agly Brothers 2008 Red (Côtes du Roussillon),"This concentrated and lush wine opens with notes of black cherry and berry, with supporting accents of baking spice, toast and cigar tobacco.

Named after the producer's owner, it is a flagship wine, intense and just ready to drink.",100.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14017,Joseph Perrier 2008 Cuvée Josephine Brut  (Champagne),"This is the producer's prestige cuvée, a fine perfumed blend with a great balance between the ripe fruitiness, the balanced dosage and a crisp edge of pink-grapefruit flavors.

14018,Louis Roederer 2012 Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"This mature generous wine is perfectly ready to drink. Its red fruits are now balanced by a toasty character as well as ripe acidity and a touch of tannin. This is a very fine wine, balanced and rich. Drink now.",80.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14020,Domaine Saint-Rémy 2015 Ehrhart Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The senses are immediately captured by the purity of the perfectly ripe apple notes that rise from the glass. The palate continues in that pure, joyous, juicy vein. This has incredible power and despite its muscle and undoubted weight there is no fat. The palate is dry and streamlined and bouncing with fruit and life. Lovely now, sure to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2030.",30.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14021,Domaine Zinck 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The tart but tropical charm of passion fruit plays around the nose before more zesty citrus notes become apparent. The palate is generous with juicy peach, yellow pear and citrus. The vein of lemon freshness at the core is totally seductive. While the palate is patently dry, the absolute juiciness of the fruit will get you, as will the clean but aromatic finish. Drink 2017–2027.",49.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14022,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar. A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 2017–2035.",30.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14023,Emile Beyer 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Warming aromatic notes of fresh and dried peach reach the nose. The palate revels in the peachy sweetness, adding a lovely, pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. The flavors are concentrated and have both a welcome tangy zesty edge and some honeyed spice. There is quite a bit of palpable warmth. This is full on and exploding with peachy fruit. The medium-sweet finish is long and warming. Drink 2017–2027.",50.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14025,Hugel 2011 Grossi Laüe Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A very lifted touch of fir honey hits the nose first before ripe peach with the merest touch of vanilla follow. The palate is incisive and concentrated. Alcoholic heat fires up the mellow, rich and rounded palate that brims with peachy fruit and flavor while zesty lemon oil hints illuminate and brighten the richness. This seems to have only just started on its trajectory. It is ready to drink but it will evolve much further, becoming ever more itself. The finish is just off dry and very long with lemon zest and peach. Drink 2017–2037.",75.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14027,Boizel 2000 Joyau de France  (Champagne),"Aged for 15 years on its lees, this mature Champagne is toasty, shedding its bright fruitiness while gaining a richer, more developed and nuanced character. Almonds and spice are partnered with intense acidity, resulting in a beautiful wine that is ready to enjoy now.",150.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14028,André Kientzler 2016 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A very tender touch of peach is felt on the nose. On the palate it is bright lemon freshness that takes over. Despite the lemony concentration on the dry taut palate, there is a wonderfully light touch. A zesty edge of pleasantly bitter pith accentuates the citrus freshness perfectly. This is luminous and refreshing, vivid and bright. The finish is totally citrus-focused and lip-smackingly moreish. Drink 2017–2035.",37.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14029,Besserat de Bellefon 2012 Triple B  (Champagne),"Produced from organically grown grapes, this is a rich wine.

14030,Bestheim 2015 Anne de K Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Aromatic notes of tangerine and mandarin play on the nose, making for a heady opening.

14031,Boeckel 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 2017–2030 at least.",42.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14035,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"An earthy touch of yeast plays promisingly on the nose. The palate then comes in with a concentrated load of ripe peach, bright lemon and rounded rose perfume. An edge of dark fir honey adds even more spicy richness. This brims with flavor, showing rich fruit against fresh lemon. There is lots of excitement here but also balance. This is a rich warming generous wine. Drink 2017–2027.",36.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14036,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Mandelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Earth and apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose and palate. It is the green apple with its chamomile edge and above all the bright ripe lemon freshness which expands across the dry palate. This is full of bright refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030.",40.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14040,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2015 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Enticingly bracing grapefruit freshness streams from the glass. The palate has a milder sort of freshness—think very ripe bright lemon notes. The flavors are pleasingly focused—sharp and clean, with dryness and a soaring freshness that lightens up everything. There is a wonderfully light touch here. It's a beautiful and totally refreshing wine. Drink 2017–2030.",44.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14041,Kuentz-Bas 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Trois Châteaux Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of yeast still clings to the beautifully fresh apple nose of this wine while the palate still tingles with some residual carbon dioxide. This is rather young but the fruit is very pure in crisp green-apple notes and fresh, tangy lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and very taut and fresh. Some yeasty notes also swing along on the palate. This certainly needs bottle age but promises to become a lemon-scented, fresh and linear marvel. It certainly has bags of tension and freshness. The finish is bright, refreshing and utterly clean.",39.0,94,3,0.9917289317502116
14055,Les Vins de Vienne 2010 Les Archevêques  (Condrieu),"Despite showing a relatively dark straw hue, this wine is fresh and floral on the nose.

14059,Pierre Amadieu 2010 Domaine Grand Romane Cuvée Prestige  (Gigondas),"One of Amadieu's top wines, this is a full-bodied, richly textured Gigondas that nevertheless maintains a sense of precision in its assertive herb-laced notes of plum and espresso.

14084,Château Tour Grand Faurie 2014  Saint-Émilion,"Full of the bright fruit typical of the vintage, this wine is made from 90% Merlot with a touch of Cabernet Franc.

14172,Château Saint-Michel 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,A Bordeaux saved from its high alcohol by its acidity. There is power and superripe fruit yet parallel to these is the black currant acidity that cuts right through. Age for 1–2 years.,22.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
14176,Domaines Lapalu 2010 Famille Lapalu  (Médoc),"A soft wine, with some light wood aging while the fruit gives black currant stalkiness, dry tannins and fresh, juicy, smoky acidity. The wine needs no aging, but could develop for 2–3 years.",12.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116

14515,Château Margüi 2011 Titien de Margüi Red (Coteaux Varois en Provence),"While rich, this blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is also quite herbal in character.

14767,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Le Grand Chemarin  (Sancerre),"One of Jolivet's single-vineyard wines, this comes from a south-facing parcel in the heartland of Sancerre.

14768,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Le Roc  (Sancerre),"This wine comes from a single vineyard, planted on flint soil. It has a definite steely character that has been softened by the year in bottle.

14826,J. Dumangin Fils 2004 Vintage Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"Ripe yet crisp, this is a fine reflection of the excellent 2004 vintage in Champagne.

14904,Lelarge-Pugeot 2005 Millésime Premier Cru Extra Brut  (Champagne),"Still young, this wine is showing structure and a dense texture as well as tight fruitiness. It's a blend of one-third of each of Champagne's principal grapes, giving good balance and intense acidity. The low dosage has made the wine dry without losing a ripe, full character.

14922,Domaine de la Bonne Tonne 2013 Côte du Py  (Morgon),"Light in color, this wine seems already mature. It has a leathery character, the fruit subdued to the structure. It's attractive to drink as a mature wine that is ready now.",28.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
14924,Domaine Victor Sornin 2014 Nature  (Beaujolais-Villages),"An organic, low-sulphur wine, this is all about soft fruitiness.

14925,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine des Rosiers  (Moulin-à-Vent),"Aromas of bananas follow through to the palate of this wine, spoiling the structured black plums and tannins. The wine is fresh and juicy, with some dry structure at the background. Drink from 2016.",24.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
14926,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine Mont Chavy  (Morgon),"While there is a good structure here, this wine is spoiled by banana flavors that dominate the otherwise attractive red berry fruits.

14933,Louis Jadot 2014  Beaujolais,"This wine is fruity although it also has weight and a rich strand of spice and red plum-skin tannins. This 100% Gamay could age at least until early 2016, although one can just drink it now.",13.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
14934,Lucien Albrecht 2007 Cuvée Henri Riesling (Alsace),"A fascinating nose, with grapefruit, kiwi, citrus, orange rind and hay that fold in to a peach/pear structure in the mouth.

14948,E. Guigal 2007  Tavel,This is an expressive wine and quite powerful for a rosé.

14965,Château Lestruelle 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"Still very young, this is a Maison Bouey wine with good potential. It offers hints of the ripe yellow fruits and richness that will come as it develops.

14972,Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace),The nose is shy but the palate is full of generous ripe pear fruit that's wonderfully countered by equally ample freshness.

14973,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Bergheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The nose gives little away.

This is off dry, intensely fruity but very balanced and refreshing.",28.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
14974,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Cuvée Engel Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Lovely red apple, ripe pear and mirabelle plum create an appetizing nose.

14975,Domaine G. Metz 2014 Cuvée Mégane Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A touch of narcissus precedes the full-fruited notes of peach on the nose. The palate has the same generous peach but also a slightly bitter tangy edge that gives structure to the rich wine. This is intense, rich and medium sweet, with a lasting rich finish.",30.0,90,3,0.9917289317502116
14976,Domaine Jean Sipp 2015 Cuvée Carole Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Honey, honeysuckle and peach on the nose create a most inviting aroma. These flavors are even more clearly apparent on the medium-dry palate where they are brightened and intensified by lemon freshness.

14977,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler 2015 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"Pure notes of russet pear rise from the glass with their wonderful combination of juicy ripeness and moreish freshness.

15005,Château Moya 2011  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"With attractive mint aromas, this polished wine balances structure and fruit.

15033,Les Clos de Paulilles 2009 Rimage  (Banyuls),"Notes of dried dark berry, leathery spice, sweet tobacco and chocolate-covered cherry fill the nose of this wine.

15039,Sauvion 2001  Sancerre,"Its citrus and melon aromas unfortunately also take on the added and unwanted scent of cleaning solution. The mouth is tart and lean, with lots of lemon. It finishes on the sour side. Properly chilled and with the right food, however, it could be refreshing.",15.0,83,3,0.9917289317502116
15045,Domaine Champeau 1999  Pouilly-Fumé,"Flat and predominantly dull, there is some lemon and stoniness to the palate, but it's pretty thin and a tad chalky. Low acidity makes it feel heavier than it should.",19.0,82,3,0.9917289317502116

15086,Nicolas Idiart 2012 Château Caillivet  (Graves),"With 12 months in wood, this is a firm wine, with a rustic, funky character that masks the black-currant fruit. The smoky wood contrasts with the acidity while leaving a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",24.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
15088,Vieux Château des Combes 2013  Saint-Émilion,"This 90-acre vineyard has produced an attractive, light wine. Fruity with red-berry flavors, it is already soft and fresh. Acidity and touches of tannin are balanced enough for the wine to be ready to drink.",29.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116
15102,Château du Moulin Rouge 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Fresh and fruity, this wine is full of black currants and acidity that is structured by a core of dark tannins. While it is firm at the moment it's likely to fill out, with the fresh fruitiness emerging. Drink from 2017.",18.0,85,3,0.9917289317502116

15137,Château Côte Montpezat 2011 Cuvée Compostelle  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux),"This very rich, wood-aged wine is dense and powerful.

15193,Domaine Ehrhart 2006 Grand Cru Schlosberg Riesling (Alsace),The very reliable but little-known house of Ehrhart turns in a true stunner with this Riesling from the Schlossberg vineyard.
