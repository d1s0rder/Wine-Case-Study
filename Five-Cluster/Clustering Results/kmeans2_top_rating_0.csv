309,Torbreck 2012 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",225.0,97,0,0.9967532089723447
41067,Mouchão 2012 Red (Alentejo),"The estate wine from Mouchão is always a great wine. This latest release, almost black in color and five-years-old, is hugely rich, powered by black fruits and juicy acidity. Made principally from Alicante Bouschet, it shows the power and the aging potential of this variety in the Alentejo. This wine, foot-trodden in open stone lagars, is destined for much longer aging. Drink at the earliest in 2021.",75.0,97,0,0.9967532089723447
50987,Standish 2012 Andelmonde Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"You may have to scour the country to secure some of this (only 14 cases were imported), but this is a treasure worth the search. It's full bodied without seeming overly rich or heavy, framing the lush notes of dark berries, grilled meat, mint and licorice with supple tannins. Spice-driven flavors linger elegantly on the lengthy finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2030.",95.0,97,0,0.9967532089723447
78037,Teso La Monja 2012 Alabaster  (Toro),"Gorgeous from head to toe, this saturated Toro heavyweight sets a new bar for this winery and the region as a whole. Ribald blackberry aromas are toasty and carry a strong note of crushed stones. Cassis, black plum and blackberry flavors are complex and inspired, while the finish tastes of chocolaty oak, blackened toast and a black-fruit potpourri supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink from 2017–2030.",227.0,97,0,0.9967532089723447
102573,Quinta do Vale Meão 2012 Red (Douro),"This is one of the grand wines of the Douro, from the last estate to be founded by the legendary Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. This is a long-lasting wine showing a fresh character, with dense, dark tannins and intense floral fruit. This will age for many years, so don't drink before 2020.",90.0,97,0,0.9967532089723447
14199,Marco Abella 2012 El Perer Carignan (Priorat),"This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee. Drink through 2023.",770.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
50988,Thorn Clarke 2012 Ron Thorn Single Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa),"Thorn Clarke has taken its Shiraz to a new level with this single-vineyard wine, bottled only in exceptional vintages. The 100% new American oak gives this a classic Barossa profile, starting with vanilla, cedar and maple syrup-like notes and flowing seamlessly through ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's full bodied, lush and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2025, possibly beyond.",89.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
67014,Castell 2012 Casteller Kugelspiel Eiswein Silvaner (Franken),"Luscious honey, marmalade and grapefruit perfume bursts from the glass of this bristling Silvaner eiswein. The palate is almost cloudlike in its delicacy yet lavishly creamy too, dusted by lingering hints of mineral, earth and umami. It's delicious already but structured enough to improve over the next decade.",220.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
68926,F X Pichler 2012 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is always a major wine, and this vintage is no exception. It is spectacularly ripe, spicy, concentrated and fruity. The yellow fruits, tangy citrus and mineral structure all contribute to an intense complexity. Age this wine for many years and don't drink before 2017.",89.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
71397,Kracher 2012 Nouvelle Vague Nr. 6 Grande Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese White (Burgenland),"The perfume of fully ripe, lusciously juicy peach is nearly overwhelming. It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts. Nectar indeed.",45.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
78040,Kay Brothers 2012 Amery Vineyard Block 6 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length. Drink 2020–2030, and likely then some.",120.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
97934,Emmerich Knoll 2012 Ried Loibenberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017.",92.0,96,0,0.9967532089723447
320,Torbreck 2012 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2030.",125.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
13591,Vinha Paz 2012 Reserva Red (Dão),"Vinha Paz is the property of surgeon, António Canto Moniz, who decided to produce wine on his family farm in the 1990s. This latest vintage of the Reserva is intense, dense, and concentrated while never losing sight for an instant of the structure and texture of the finest Dão wines. Dark berry fruits are sustained by tannins, wood aging and final acidity. Keep this wine until 2020.",50.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
14132,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2012 Vinha do Rio Red (Douro),This top wine from Quinta Vale Dona Maria comes from a small parcel of old vines on the estate close to the river Torto. Foot treading in lagars give the wine its richness and sumptuous character. It also provides tannins that are cushioned by the superripe black fruits and acidity. This long-term wine shouldn't be touched until 2020.,150.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
14134,Wine & Soul 2012 Pintas Red (Douro),"The original vineyard owned by winemaking husband and wife Jorge Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva, this is halfway up the Pinhão Valley, close to some of the greatest Douro vineyards. Pintas is now well established as a Douro classic. It is powered by tannins at this stage, but the structure, the lush fruit that comes from fermentation in open lagars and the sheer density of the wine, speak of greatness. Drink from 2019.",100.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
14135,Wine & Soul 2012 Quinta da Manoella Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro),"Made from vines planted over a century ago and fermented in open lagars, this is a powerful and magnificent wine. With great tannins forming the base for opulent fruits black fruits and a serious structure, it should age for many years. Drink from 2020.",100.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
18849,Salomon-Undhof 2012 Alte Reben Berglagen Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Rich aromas of late summer are here: the ripe peel of yellow pears, luscious peach and yellow Mirabelle plum plus some dried hayflower notes. There is power and depth, along with some alcoholic heat and balancing acidity—beautiful now but it will get even better. Drink until 2020.",35.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
18853,Josef Jamek 2012 Ried Klaus Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"Lifted ripeness and candied lemon peel send their aromas heavenwards. These rounded aromas with a fetching touch of bitter fir and honey also appear on the palate where acidity is present but cushioned. Like honey parfait spiked with lemon peel, this is lovely and lingers long.",75.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
18856,Rudi Pichler 2012 Wösendorfer Kirchweg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"The tightly closed nose only gives away a little ripe red apple. Even with the fruit locked underneath the stones, the sleek power, the impression of saltiness and lime-zest purity of this wine whisper promises. These will be kept, at least if you wait until 2017. This one will last and last.",75.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
