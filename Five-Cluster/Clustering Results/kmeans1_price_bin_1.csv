25564,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",52.0,97,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
8890,Roark Wine Co. 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.",52.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
25567,Merry Edwards 2008 Flax Vineyard Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016.",54.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14198,Arista 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential.

25565,Merry Edwards 2008 Klopp Ranch Méthode a L'Ancienne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging.",57.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14786,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Estate Vineyard Etzel Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way.",60.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14211,Ken Wright 2014 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Somehow, in a stellar 2014 lineup, this vineyard designate stands out, as the 2012 did when it was the Wine Enthusiast 2015 wine of the year. Power and precision work in tandem here. The fruit blend conjures up melon, berry, cherry and more, and the oak has the gentlest touch to its presence. There's tremendous midpalate concentration, and the clear sense that this could age for decades. Let's just say drink 2018 through 2030.",63.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14196,Ken Wright 2014 Bryce Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This riveting wine displays the exceptional finesse and precision that fruit from this AVA can deliver.

Drink 2018 through 2030.",63.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
6571,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",70.0,97,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4058,Calera 2013 Reed Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"From a vineyard that Josh Jensen planted in 1975 comes this bottling that shows sultry black plum, minty herbs, tarragon, black slate, smashed mulberry and a touch of pork fat. A wondrous array of baked red and black fruit meet with clove, nutmeg, more tarragon and minty flavors on the palate too, producing delicious, dynamic flavor. It's like an expertly cooked stew of fruit, spice and herb.",70.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
25566,Lynmar 2009 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An enormously rich Pinot Nor, stunningly delicious. Hard to imagine a California Pinot offering more opulent notes at such a young age. Dazzles with raspberry and cherry pie filling, vanilla, toast and scads of spices, and feels so soft, so silky, yet finishes so dry. Really a stunner. Should glidepath through the next six years, gradually growing mushroomy.",70.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14205,Alloro 2014 Estate Justina Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"An extra dollop of toasty oak amplifies the deep black-cherry core.

Drink now through the mid-2020s.",85.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4064,Calera 2013 Jensen Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"A stunning range of black sage, fresh bay leaf, hearty mulberry, exotic cinnamon, raw beef and baking spice converge for a rugged yet pretty nose on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975. Elderberry and elderflower show on the sip, as do beet juice, dried ginger, crushed rocks, potting soils and a concentrated potpourri of purple flowers.",88.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4060,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle. Sultry baking spice accents kirsch and strawberry, with understudies of tar, rose garden and tannin, all framed by moderate acidity. Cellar through 2023.",90.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
14185,Arista 2014 Two Birds Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine.",90.0,97,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4059,Wayfarer 2014 Mother Rock Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024.",115.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4057,Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.",115.0,97,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4061,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024.",115.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
25501,Keller Estate 2005 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.",150.0,96,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
4054,Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",155.0,98,1,0.9331578735408413,above 40
