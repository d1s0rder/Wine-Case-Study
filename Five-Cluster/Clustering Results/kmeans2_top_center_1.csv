405,Chehalem 2012 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth.",29.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
545,Rodney Strong 2012 Charlotte's Home Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit.

624,Nottingham Cellars 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Micro-lot Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley),"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.",50.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
626,Pride Mountain 2012 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),"Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.",65.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103

914,Brecon Estate 2012 Forty Two Red (Paso Robles),"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas.

925,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",42.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
937,WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",28.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
961,Scott Harvey 2012 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin.

1028,Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley),"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot.

1265,Brys 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),"Dark-berry aromas meet hints of menthol and game on the nose. The medium-bodied palate follows suit on entry, but becomes lighter by the midpalate from a slick of minerality. Pair alongside gamy meats such as grilled venison loin.",50.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
1287,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits.

1295,Charles Smith 2012 Stoneridge Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth.

1450,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer.",18.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
1456,Gamache 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, licorice, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by slightly gritty-feeling cranberry flavors. This wine is interesting, but it doesn't all come together.",25.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
1521,Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon),"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",25.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
1579,Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones.

Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",40.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
1580,Va Piano 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents.

1587,Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",45.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
1602,V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley),"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",37.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
1669,Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi),"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",13.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
1676,Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley),"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",38.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103
1684,Merrill Cellars 2012 Cotes du Rogue G-S-M (Oregon),"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate.",29.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103

1773,Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",24.0,86,1,0.9650103428821103

1942,South Stage 2012 Carmenère (Rogue Valley),"This shows the tannic chewy, vegetal nature of the grape, without off-setting it with other flavors. One-third new French oak has made little impact, and the wine is rough and astringent through a quick finish.",28.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
1989,Rock Wall 2012 Heringer Vineyard Teroldego (Yolo County),"Floral aromas like lilac and lavender, then dry and substantial flavors like blueberry and boysenberry give this full-bodied wine an interesting personality.

1990,Santa Barbara Winery 2012 Curtis Vineyard Petit Verdot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Rich aromas of black cherry, anise seeds and buttered violets greet the nose on this dense bottling of a grape that rarely gets solo treatment.

2001,Merryvale 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley),"A soft and layered expression of dense black cherry, chocolate and spicy tobacco, this is easy to enjoy and approachable, rich and round. A taste of black licorice dots the finishing moments.",75.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
2060,Banshee Wines 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Sweet-pea and citrus flavors are pleasant, along with a welcome touch of creamy oak for richness. But there's also hints of green, unripe fruit in this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc.",18.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
2067,Emerson 2012 Viognier (Willamette Valley),"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.",20.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
2113,Hawk Watch Winery 2012 Syrah (South Coast),"Lighter in color and body than many counterparts, this wine presents a sour blackberry and woody herb nose. Black olives, elderberries, cedar and black pepper beef flavors show on the gravelly palate.",32.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103

2136,Collection 35 2012 Rancho Arroyo Perdido Grüner Veltliner (Santa Barbara County),"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare.",29.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
2147,Hogue 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish.",11.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
2216,Rancho Zabaco 2012 Sonoma Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone.

2224,Two Mountain 2012 Copeland Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.",25.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
2228,Borra 2012 Markus Nimmo White (California),"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly.",22.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
2238,Hansen Cellars 2012 Viognier (Lodi),"Rich in flavor and texture, this smells like white peach and buttered popcorn with a hint of chalky earthiness.

2265,Lone Madrone 2012 Barbera (Paso Robles),"A fairly uncommon grape for the entire Central Coast, this bottling offers squeezed blueberry and dark purple fruit aromas bolstered by black pepper and black rocks. Lighter in body than expected upon the sip, the palate shows cola, bright cranberry juice and a sandalwood spice that makes it very easy to drink.",40.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
2273,Asuncion Ridge 2012 Nefarious Red (Paso Robles),"Purple fruit aromas of blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry are given complexity with Indian spice, hot asphalt and beef char on the nose of this blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Grenache.

2296,Patland 2012 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),"The producer travels to Stagecoach Vineyard on Atlas Peak to source 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Syrah and 7% Malbec, making for a softly layered wine with plenty of structure.

2343,Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills),"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices.

Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine.

8355,Dusted Valley 2012 Squirrel Tooth Alice Red (Wahluke Slope),"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest.",39.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
8377,Ledger David 2012 Sangiovese (Rogue Valley),"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak.

11046,Tre Anelli 2012 Rosé Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Deep ruby pink in color, this wine begins with a nuanced nose, mixing the fun of grape soda with the elegance of purple flowers.

11544,Fess Parker 2012 Rodney's Vineyard Dry Riesling (Santa Barbara County),"This is a beautiful Riesling. It's not totally dry, like the label says, because there's a vein of honey that enriches the orange, apricot and white flower flavors, and persists into the finish.

This bottling offers red currant, cedar, leather and minty chocolate on the nose, while the palate conveys lots of herbal influence, from peppercorn, licorice and dill to minty black raspberry and eucalyptus oil.

18202,Kiona 2012 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Red Mountain),"Kiona's ice wines are legendary, and this latest is as excellent as any they've done. Butterscotch scents invite further exploration.

18288,Atalon 2012 Pauline's Cuvée Red (Napa Valley),"Made from a majority of Merlot rounded out by other red Bordeaux varieties, this wine leans savory, featuring mushroom and leather within a suggestion of Martini olive water.

18386,Qupé 2012 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley),"Avoids the variety's opulent, often sweet side in favor of a leaner, drier, more elegant style.

18400,Alma Sol 2012 Almazan Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"This blend of Tempranillo and Touriga Nacional delivers aromas of dried cherries, light herbs and graphite.

18633,Gård 2012 Lawrence Vineyards Grand Klasse Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine has unusual, penetrating, floral aromatics and a liqueur-like character.

37036,Bending Branch 2012 Estate Cuvée Red (Texas),"This is an approachable blend of Aglianico, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Mourvédre, Petite Sirah and Tempranillo, melding ripe dark cherry, vanilla and cedar on the nose and palate.

37265,Gård 2012 Lawrence Vineyards Grand Klasse Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used.

37272,Sleight of Hand 2012 The Conjurer Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and 34% Cabernet Franc.

37437,Keating 2012 Petite Sirah (Rockpile),"Complex tannins confound the palate at first, but mellow on the back side, inviting gregarious amounts of leather, black pepper and blackberry, a waft of cigar smoke in the mix, too. Fuller-bodied in style, the wine will benefit from time; cellar through 2020.",38.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
37439,Locus 2012 Stonetree Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas lead off this wine, along with plum. On the palate rich, textured dark fruit flavors intermingle with barrel spices. The fruit and oak have equal footing.",25.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
37447,Pacific Rim 2012 Noble Wine Selenium Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"This botrytized wine came from 2011 vintage grapes that were not harvested until February 2012.

37484,Rancho Sisquoc 2012 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"This wine from the pioneering producer deep in the Santa Maria Valley shows sweet cedar, chopped herbs, mocha, licorice, cherry and red berry juice on the nose.

37513,Terre Rouge 2012 Tête-à-Tête Red (Sierra Foothills),"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style red. The meaty, spicy, earthy aromas lead to enjoyable fruit, spice and mocha flavors that rest on a firm bed of fine tannins and good acidity.",20.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103

37574,Nico 2012 Moscato (California),"While this is a Moscato, it's unlike most of the Moscatos out there on the market. For one thing, it's bone dry. Without the distracting taste of honey, you can really taste the underlying citrus fruits and white flowers, as well as a stimulating minerality. The acidity is excellent.",20.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
37576,Oberon 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Tasted in late August, there was a spritziness that may well disappear by the time this wine is available on the market. That fizziness is by no means unattractive. It brings a bright, Champagne-like kick to the Meyer-lemon, lime, apricot and papaya flavors that make this Sauvignon Blanc so savory.",18.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
37577,Open Range 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"This is a tremendous value for such a good wine, made by Casey Flat Ranch winemaker Laura Barrett, a medium-textured swirl of grapefruit, melon and ripe orange.

37584,Vía 2012 Fox Hill Vineyard Tocai Friulano (Mendocino County),"Barrel fermented in neutral oak, this Mendo Tocai Friulano is dry and slightly savory. Aromatic with citrus—mostly lemon—and a crisp taste of lemon on the palate too. A plate of savory, spicy charcuterie and herb-dusted cheeses would pair just right.",25.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
37585,Longboard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The sour tang of green gooseberry immediately brings New Zealand to mind in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc.

37812,HammerSky 2012 Open Invite Red (Paso Robles),"This untraditional blend works well, with the leathery 25% Merlot component restraining the boisterous fruit of the 75% Zinfandel. The nose mixes gravel, black-cherry blossom, mint and black cardamom, while the palate is both ripe and grippy, with olallieberries, plum-skin tannins, woody elderberries and vanilla bean. It's quite complex and dynamic.",49.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103

37901,Obelisco Estate 2012 BDX Merlot (Red Mountain),"The wood and alcohol seem to get out front of aromas of plum, raspberry and medicine cabinet.

37933,Claiborne & Churchill 2012 Dry Gewürztraminer (Central Coast),"Another classic Gewürz from this fine winery, their best ever. As the label indicates, it's dry, but has an apparent sweetness, with honey-infused orange, Asian pear and litchee nut flavors, and those fabulous exotic spices that are so unique to the variety.",20.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
37941,Raptor Ridge 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Loaded with scents and flavors of grapefruit, this leesy, textural Pinot Gris is bracing and mouth-filling. It's definitely on the tart side, but could be paired with a wide variety of fish and poultry dishes.",20.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103
37943,Sineann 2012 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"A sweet, slightly sugary Oregon Riesling that gives a gentle nod to the German Kabinett style. The low (8%) alcohol is the tip-off.

37954,Campovida 2012 Bonofiglio Vineyard Roussanne (Mendocino County),"A fragrant Roussanne that could easily convince doubters that this variety does impressively stand on its own.

38096,Cloak & Dagger 2012 The Conspirator's Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),"An array of damp, dank herbs shows on the nose of this bottling from the Fairbairn Vineyard, with aromas of oregano, thyme, chaparral and moist earth. The palate is relatively light in body, showing flavors of oregano-crusted pork roast and a woody character.",49.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
38148,J. Lohr 2012 Cuvée Pom Red (Paso Robles),"This annual study of Pomerol by the longtime California producer is a bit reserved and nearly austere on the nose, slowly revealing black coffee bean, tar, elderberry and herbs. Crushed herbs and bittersweet chocolate show once sipped, giving slight spice to the dense elderberry and blueberry fruit. It's still a bit wound-up, so drink 2018–2028.",50.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
38170,Waters 2012 Interlude Red (Washington),"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec.

38175,Coquelicot 2012 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),"“Gas station” isn't necessarily the most attractive fine-wine descriptor, but it's both apt and complimentary for a dry Riesling. This one reeks of petrol and tar. On the palate, a warm tar presence slowly evolves toward vanilla. A vibrant, tingling acidity indicates decent cellaring potential. At the very least, this is a great wine to show your friends how petrol can be a defining and excellent character in wine.",29.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
38202,Palmer 2012 Albariño (North Fork of Long Island),"Intense perfume and floral notes overcome ripe apple aromas. It's dry on the palate with flavors of savory apple and green herbs, but feels a bit flat and heavy in mouthfeel.",25.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103

38229,Kunde 2012 Dunfillan Cuvée Red (Sonoma County),"Sanguine, high-toned red fruit features prominently in this almost-equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.

38277,Sunset Hills 2012 Viognier (Virginia),"This has a tropical- and grapy-scented nose, with notes of pineapple and melon at the fore. On the palate, this Viognier is voluptuous and intense, offering a peachy flavor and perky acidity that invigorate the palate.",26.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
38293,JCB 2012 No. 8 Pinot Noir Rosé (Sonoma Coast),"The dark orange-amber color suggests the extracted richness of this blush, which proves itself once you taste it. It's ripe in raspberries, strawberries, vanilla and orange zest, with a honeyed finish. While it's a little heavy for a rosé, it is delicious.",25.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
38296,Maddalena 2012 Moscato Muscat Canelli (Paso Robles),"You have to classify this as a dessert wine, because of the residual sugar sweetness. The honey, apricot, orange and vanilla flavors are balanced with refreshing acidity.",15.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
38418,Martin Ranch 2012 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Malbec (Santa Clara Valley),"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec.

38462,Shady Lane 2012 Estate Franc 'n' Franc Red (Leelanau Peninsula),"A blend of 57% Cabernet Franc, 26% Blaufränkish and 17% Merlot, this estate wine is overtly floral on the nose, with violet and earthy geranium on a bed of red berries. The palate is racy and lithe from pulsing acidity, yet flavors of juicy blueberry and red currant prevail and ultimately the grippy tannins balance it out.",25.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
38557,Gallegos 2012 Dos Hermanos Red (Napa Valley),"Made from half Merlot and half Petite Sirah, and aged in French oak, only 30% of it new, this wine shows well in a dusting of mocha powder and blackberry, the flavors built around a thick, dense torso of soft tannins.

38579,Schramsberg 2012 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Coast),"One of Schramsberg's younger releases, and made from all white grapes, this wine has tantalizing aromas of vanilla, apple and light toast that lead to layered and creamy flavors.

38867,Lancaster 2012 Sophia's Hillside Cuvée Red (Alexander Valley),"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also holds 4% of Malbec and 4% of Merlot, a hearty yet elegant showing of the appellation.

42051,V. Sattui 2012 Grenache (Napa Valley),"A brooding foundation of blackberry and mushroomy earth lift this full-bodied, tannic wine, which needs further time in bottle to develop. Spicy cinnamon, clove and pepper keep it lively on the palate, between the density and concentration of oak. Let this wine unwind in the bottle through 2020.",35.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42062,Kunde 2012 Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Raspberry and vanilla introduce this wine, made from a selection of vines 21 to 130 years old, with some planted in 1882. Lusty and lush layers of cinnamon and cola accent the fruit and provide complexity, the tannins resolved and thick.",45.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42063,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though not labeled as such, this is a single-vineyard wine coming from Dineen Family Vineyard. It shows appealing aromas of toast, nut oil and melon. The flavors are lighter in style but bring a sense of balance that carries through the finish.",35.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42066,South Stage 2012 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),"Cab Franc is often a high point in lineups of red wines from the Rogue Valley, but this one misses the mark. A sweaty nose gets it off to a rough start, and the flavors of stems and green tannins do nothing to help the tart generic fruit. It might slip comfortably into a flight of budget Bordeaux from a cool year.",29.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
42100,Pride Mountain 2012 Syrah (Sonoma County),"Full-bodied and layered, this is a stellar example of the variety, exhibiting elegance beneath a broader exterior. Black pepper and blackberry wrap around dense tannins and a robust texture. The wine is co-fermented with Viognier to bring a floral note to the bouquet.",60.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
42114,Acorn 2012 Alegría Vineyards Axiom Syrah (Russian River Valley),"From a field blend interplanted with Viognier, which accounts for 2% of the wine, this dense, thick expression of this burly variety exudes velvety blueberry and blackberry around almost impenetrable tannins, the leathery roughness still being sorted out. Cellar through 2020 to coax out its finer flavors of mocha and meat.",35.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
42150,Graziano 2012 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Somehow this wine is bold, full bodied and superripe—yet balanced, sleek and structured. Tart, vibrant fruit aromas like raspberry and cranberry are followed by rich, almost sweet strawberry and red cherry flavors. A layer of fine tannins adds grip to the mouthfeel, and firm acidity keeps everything from being heavy.",19.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
42151,Hendry 2012 Hendry Vineyard Red (Napa Valley),"Nearly equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also features good handfuls of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc that offer soft, velvety flavors of blackberry and blueberry.

42170,Shannon Ridge 2012 High Elevation Collection Zinfandel (Lake County),"Aromas like spiced apple and brown sugar lead to luscious fruit and spice flavors and a plush texture in this medium-bodied wine. It has the richness and near-sweetness that can pair well with slowly cooked meats and mildly spicy dishes, but sips well on its own as well.",23.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
42172,William Grassie 2012 Impératrice Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled as a red blend, at 94% this could be a varietally labeled Merlot and it drinks like it. Aromas of cocoa, raspberry and spice box are followed by plump, soft chocolate and raspberry flavors accented by tart acids that hold the balance through the finish.",49.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
42195,Peirano 2012 The Heritage Collection Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"Here is a big, friendly wine with plenty of sweet, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors, and an easygoing texture that's not too tannic or acidic. It shows smoky, almost sweet, toasted oak aromas and basically melts in your mouth like milk chocolate, which would make a good pairing.",13.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103
42215,Pepper Bridge 2012 Trine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is the first offering of this wine where Cabernet Franc (37%) takes the lead, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot (23%), Malbec (7%) and Petit Verdot.

42347,Reustle 2012 Prayer Rock Vineyards Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Umpqua Valley),"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins.",39.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
42512,Opaque 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.",35.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42514,Patland 2012 Terra Del Cuore Estate Grown Malbec (Napa Valley),"This majority varietal wine contains 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, which doesn't help to soften its powerful grip of sturdy tannin and sideshow of oak. Blueberry and chocolate come to the fore slowly between meaty leather and a dusty aroma.",75.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42545,Robert Mondavi 2012 Private Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"Green bell pepper and gooseberry notes dominate this Sauvignon Blanc, although it does have notes of honey and Meyer lemons. It's bright in acidity, and the finish is spicy and clean. For the price, it's a good value.",11.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
42546,Tin Barn 2012 Hi Vista Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"Ripe fruit and vibrant acidity combine to make this an easy-drinking wine. It exhibits honey-drizzled lemon, orange and pear flavors, but the acidity saves the day.",18.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103

42585,Chamisal Vineyards 2012 Syrah (Edna Valley),"Fresh yet focused aromas of pressed boysenberries, white pepper, beef jerky, teriyaki and wet stone greet the nose on this bottling by winemaker Fintan du Fresne. Asphalt-laden flavors of black cherries, dill and dried mint decorate a medium-bodied palate that will appeal to fans of both cool and warmer-climate Syrah.",38.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
42609,Gibbs 2012 Money Road Cuvée Merlot (Oakville),"This affordable offering from a prime site within the appellation introduces itself with burly, smoky undertones and a thick skin, remaining grippy and smoky in black fruit throughout. Full bodied, it shows the warmth of the vintage and ripeness of valley floor grapes.",24.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103
42636,Idilico 2012 Reserva Upland Vineyard Graciano (Snipes Mountain),"This wine captivates with its exotic aroma profile of citrus peel, mango, leather, cranberries and pepper.

42641,Owen Roe 2012 Union Gap Red (Yakima Valley),"This wine is 45% Cabernet Franc, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 11% Malbec.

42642,Rasa 2012 In Order to Form a More Perfect Union Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The oak (70% new puncheons) is primary at present on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Aromas of vanilla, café au lait and woodspice are out in front of cherry and herbs. The palate shows nuance, detail and length. It needs time in the cellar to come together. Best after 2020.",95.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
42651,Seven Hills 2012 Pentad Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Carménère, this brooding wine brings aromas of moist soil, herb, black tea, eucalyptus, fig and spice.

42653,Terre Rouge 2012 L'Autre Red (Sierra Foothills),"An impressive mouthfeel is the standout characteristic of this full-bodied, balanced and elegant wine. It smells and tastes subtly delicious, with restrained rather than overripe cherry and plum flavors, but the way the velvety texture of tannins and acidity surround the fruit and carry it through to the finish is remarkable. The blend holds Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah.",30.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
42662,J. Scott Cellars 2012 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Syrah is not new in Southern Oregon, but finding a consistent style has been a battle. Progress is being made. Tannins are tamed, alcohol is kept in hand, and the fruit is plenty ripe; maybe just a bit too ripe. Here the flavors are of strawberry preserves, leafy herbs, and lighter but still-astringent tannins. The wine fades fairly quickly, and should be consumed in its youth.",25.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
42664,Keating 2012 Montecillo Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Muted on the nose, this is a spicy, somewhat austere wine, shy in red berry fruit and soft tannins. From a 1,500-foot elevation vineyard, it lacks the power of some of its competitors, yet offers a balanced, less in-your-face take on the variety.",28.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
42672,Preston 2012 Syrah-Sirah Syrah-Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"A blend of 83% Syrah with 17% Petite Sirah, this is a juicy wine, bursting in black plum, blackberry and gamy smoke. Low in oak imprint, it's medium bodied, approachable and easy to like, plenty tannic but not over the top.",36.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
42733,Carr 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is a lovely Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well the Santa Ynez Valley can ripen the variety, while maintaining its vital acidity. Fermented in stainless steel, the wine shows tart flavors of lemons, limes and tropical fruits.",18.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103
42755,Deaver 2012 Petite Sirah (Amador County),"In a flight of incredibly dark, rich and mouth-coating wines, this one stood out as especially concentrated and high octane, but well-balanced. It smells and tastes like perfectly charred steak, dark chocolate, blackberry jam without the sweetness and spices like clove and cardamom. It's so tempting to drink now, but will be best after 2020.",27.0,93,1,0.9650103428821103
42810,Cayuse 2012 Cailloux Vineyard Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"A brilliant effort, this belongs right up there with the very best New World Viogniers. White flowers, lemon curd and a lush mix of citrus aromas show immense concentration right from the start. Both precise and dense, the scents and flavors flow through into a tightly wound, mineral-soaked finish, bright with citrus and apricot fruit. The length and concentration are simply spectacular.",70.0,96,1,0.9650103428821103
42812,Hess Collection 2012 Small Block Series Malbec (Mount Veeder),"From one of the few Napa Valley wineries to showcase Malbec, this wine is a testament to the virtues of that devotion. It offers rich, dreamy flavors of blueberry cobbler, blackberry and licorice, lifted acidity and plush, soft tannins, all gorgeously finished in spicy chocolate and vanilla.",55.0,95,1,0.9650103428821103
42893,Jamie Slone Wines 2012 Super Tuscan Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Aromas of ripe grapes and vanilla make for a lush, inviting nose on this fruit-forward bottling of 49.5% Sangiovese, 49.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Malbec. The juicy palate shows blackberries and black cherries as well as licorice and dark chocolate, with strong tannins giving textural balance.",50.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42895,VinRoc 2012 RTW Red (Napa Valley),"Blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah, RTW is somewhat classical in its black olive and dried herb, yet also rich and concentrated, with tannic bite and a taste of clove. It finishes like vanilla cola.",49.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42900,Vigilance 2012 Cimarron Red (Lake County),"This bold blend has aromas like charred oak barrels and saturated flavors suggesting blackberry, black pepper and clove. It is full bodied, thick in texture and moderately tannic. For those who like obvious oakiness, it will be a treat.",25.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
42929,Schmidt 2012 Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Scents and flavors suggest dried grain and cracker, along with black cherry fruit. At first, the wine flattens out in the midpalate, but ample breathing puts more fruit and flesh on its frame.",36.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
43091,Kontos 2012 Alatus Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is 37% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with the rest split equally between Malbec and Syrah. Reticent aromas of vanilla and baking spices lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, backed by lightly grainy tannins. The hang time on the finish is downright outrageous.",38.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
43099,Jaffurs 2012 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Clean and tight aromas of strawberry essence mesh with dried violets, rose petals, star anise and clove on this engaging while classically profiled bottling. It's light and lively on the palate, with tons of bright red fruit and cinnamon spice, showing cranberry tang in the midpalate and the structural bones to hold up its energetic game for years.",34.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
43181,Browne Family Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blends fruit from Force Majeure, Blackrock and Alder Ridge vineyards. Aromas of crushed rock, dried leaves, cherry and barrel spices lead to sweet cherry and chocolate flavors. The oak (58% new French) plays a big part but it works.",35.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43186,La Sirena 2012 Grenache (Napa Valley),"This brand is winemaker Heidi Peterson Barrett's ode to Rhône, as well as a place for her own Bordeaux-varietal wines. The first vintage of this 100% varietal wine on its own, it's soft and supple with a tannic backbone. Pretty plum aromas and a streak of peppery spice and leather are joined on the palate by juicy blueberry and finished off in restrained oak.",45.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43187,La Sirena 2012 Pirate TreasuRed Red (Napa Valley),"A playful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, this hearty bottling delivers something for everyone, from the austere, classic nature of the Bordeaux varieties to the fruitiness and savory leather tones of the Rhônes. It's made to be bold, black and enjoyable now; pack a bottle or two for your next adventures, eye patch optional.",65.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43193,Novelty Hill 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Milk chocolate, cherry and raspberry aromas lead to sweet, supple luscious fruit flavors. It keeps you coming back for more.",23.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43194,Novelty Hill 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Although this wine only saw 35% new French oak, the wood plays prominently, with aromas of toast and spice out in front of cherry and raspberry. The supple feel is where this wine shines, adding multiple layers to the concentrated flavors.",28.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43195,Novelty Hill 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There's no denying this wine's appeal with its aromas and flavors of dark fruit, café au lait, earth and herbs. It's restrained yet flavorful, with a lingering, coffee-filled finish.",28.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
43266,Damiani 2012 Bollicini Sparkling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of orange blossom accent sugar cookie and brioche in this sparkling blend of Chardonany, Pinot Noir, Cayuga and Pinot Gris. It's zesty in lemon-lime acidity, finishing rich and dense.",16.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
43293,Laura Michael 2012 Old Vines Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"High-pitched acidity helps balance the bigger, bolder elements of truffle earth, leather and cherry cordial than run freely in this full-bodied softly textured wine.",35.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103
43378,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2012 Reserve Merlot-Grenache-Mourvèdre Rosé,"A neutral salmon in color, with a slightly bricked orange tinge, this blend of Merlot, Grenache and Mourvèdre drinks dry. Abundant cherry flavors come through in this medium-bodied wine.",15.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
43383,Black Stallion 2012 Viognier (Napa Valley),"There's so much ripeness in this Viognier that it's almost a dessert wine. The apricot, orange, honeysuckle flower, vanilla and spice flavors taste like they were sprinkled with white, refined sugar. The balance is crisp acidity.",35.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
43392,Tedeschi 2012 Rosé (Sonoma Coast),"Made from Pinot Noir, this blush is dry and low in alcohol, with a great burst of acidity. It's a fun wine, but the strawberry and watermelon flavors, unfortunately, are thin.",22.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
43394,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),"While this wine is crisp and clean, and the price is right, it's a little thin in flavor. Suggests peaches, pears and citrus fruits that finish with a touch of honey. It's okay for everyday food, especially Asian.",13.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103
43417,Grayson 2012 Lot 12 Zinfandel (California),"There's lots to like in this affordable Zin. It's robust and juicy with ripe blackberry, cherry, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish slightly sweet. Nice with pizza, burgers or beef tacos.",11.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
43431,Seghesio 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A soft, melted mouthfeel and sweet flavors of raspberries and brown sugar mark this Zin. High alcohol gives it some heat, as well as a glycerine feel. The finish is dry.",24.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103
43539,Aaron 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Lavish aromas of black cherry, blackberry jam, gingerbread, mincemeat pie and caramel chews combine for a hedonistic nose on this wine from Aaron Jackson. Dense, dark blueberry fruit drives the palate, which gains complexity from espresso beans, dark chocolate and graphite minerality.",44.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
43548,Carhartt Vineyard 2012 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"This wine, which blends 75% estate fruit with 25% from Rodney's Vineyard, offers black raspberry juice, black cardamom, allspice, buttered cherries and sandalwood on the nose. Bright strawberry fruit flavors are enhanced with clove spice, and a decently tart tension holds it all together.",33.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
43550,Vasco Urbano 2012 Casa de Vinas Long Row Heine Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),"Not a shy wine, this looks very dark and smells smoky and meaty. It tastes extra ripe and rich, showing off both the grapes and the sweet-seeming oak with which the wine was apparently aged. There is a strong maple syrup and smoked bacon flavor, a thick, tongue-coating texture and lingering finish.",32.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
43606,Wyncroft 2012 Shou Red (Lake Michigan Shore),"Hailing from a single vineyard in Michigan's southern AVA, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (77%), with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Verdot making up the difference. This has cooked-down bramble berry aromas on the nose, and also brings to mind twings and stems. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more character, with juicy black berry and red currant flavors elevated over green peppercorn and medium-grained tannins.",45.0,86,1,0.9650103428821103
43614,Griffin Creek 2012 Malbec (Rogue Valley),"Very little differentiates this from the winery's other single-varietal reds. They all seem like components rather than complete wines. It's dry and austere, with barely ripe red berry fruit. The hard, short finish and drying tannins make this wine difficult to like.",40.0,86,1,0.9650103428821103
43637,Gary Farrell 2012 Russian River Selection Rosé of Pinot Noir Rosé (Russian River Valley),"Although pricey for a rosé, this shows wonderful  complexity. The grapes come from two well-regarded vineyards, and the wine shows an elegant structure, with crisp acids and a dusting of tannins. It tastes of rose petals, herb tea, raspberries and nectarines.",28.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
43684,Winery by the Creek 2012 Helwig Vineyard Reserve Tempranillo (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Dried fruit flavors give a Port-like character to this full-bodied, mature and dry red wine. It smells like cherries and prunes and tastes juicy and ripe.",26.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103
43689,Westport Winery 2012 Smoky Nor'wester Red Willow Vineyard Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"Mostly Sangiovese, this wine appears to have seen some oxygen exposure that interferes with its blue fruit and herb aromas. It drinks quite sweet with a mixture of chocolate and cherry flavors.",26.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103
43745,Ampelos 2012 Phi Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley),"One of the more controlled, tighter Viogniers out there, without showing the variety's rich flamboyance. It could be a Pinot Gris, with brisk acidity and a clean, cold, steely mouthfeel, except that the citrus fruits do have rich suggestions of mangoes. Still, it shows tremendous elegance and will be delicious in many settings.",25.0,87,1,0.9650103428821103
43754,Foxen 2012 Cuvée Jeanne Marie Williamson-Dore Vineyard Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"An aromatic profile of crushed mint, hot gravel and red fruit introduces this blend of 83% Grenache and 17% Mourvèdre.

43757,Sparkman 2012 Darkness Syrah (Yakima Valley),"One of two Sparkman Syrahs, Darkness showcases fruit from two stellar Yakima valley vineyards, Boushey and Olsen. A whiff of Syrah funk, herb and earth ties into dried blueberry with a brambly, plummy component. Lovely details of nutmeg with a streak of vanilla keep the flavors interesting through a long finish.",62.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103

43887,Horse & Plow 2012 McFadden Farm Pinot Gris (Mendocino),"Subtle and steely, this Pinot Gris is crisp and lemony. It has plenty of citrus amidst a core of herbs and flowers.

43985,Reininger 2012 Birch Creek Vineyard Semillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A wine this good makes you wish there were a lot more of it. Pure Sémillon from a single vineyard, fermented in stainless steel, it opens with lovely fragrances of linalool and citrus pith, softens up in the mouth, and brings grapefruit and a hint of wet stone. It has the power of Chardonnay with more complexity than most unoaked versions of that grape.",36.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
44045,The Boneyard 2012 Skins Rkatsiteli (Virginia),"Having fermented on its skins, this wine is bolstered by delicate tannic traction, giving some foothold to the subtle white-apricot flavor. Lax acids give it an open-textured core.",20.0,83,1,0.9650103428821103
44073,Quivira 2012 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"This Rhone-inspired specialist, who also does a fine job with Zin, shows both sides of the coin in this Rhône variety that in California is more often associated and blended with Zin.

44139,Standing Sun 2012 Riesling (Santa Barbara County),"A bit more oxidized style of Riesling from Buellton-based winemaker John Wright, this delivers aromas of baking bread, roasted almonds and toast with marmalade.

44432,Simple Machine 2012 Grenache (Rogue Valley),"This is a syrupy, ripe take on Grenache, which renders it varietally unrecognizable. There's a deep core of cassis and black cherry fruit, but any remaining details have been blown out by the alcohol.",34.0,86,1,0.9650103428821103
44454,Starmont 2012 Merlot (Carneros),"From the Napa side of Carneros, this Merlot is blended with 1% Petit Verdot, which presumably has added a smidgen of weight and color to the mix.

Off-dry in style, it's round and rich on the palate with loads of luscious peach and apricot flavors, yet nuanced with layers of white blossoms, lavender and spice.

45256,Savage Grace 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"An immediately appealing wine with notes of freshly cut apple, apricot, mineral and jasmine. Though it has 17 g/L residual sugar, it drinks barely off dry with the vineyard's electric acidity more than balancing out the midpalate's sugar, providing a dry feel to the drawn-out finish.

57096,Pianetta 2012 Tuscan Nights Red (Central Coast),"The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre.

57105,Chacewater 2012 Malbec (Red Hills Lake County),"Deep color, firm tannins and a fine-grained texture set this wine apart. It smells fresh and sophisticated, with bright cranberry and rich black-cherry notes shaded by cinnamon and nutmeg. This should stand up to the richest rack of lamb and age well, too.

69826,Francis Tannahill 2012 Sundown Red (Oregon),"Off-the-charts alcohol notwithstanding, this massive wine will surely please those who like their reds big, dense and deep. It's principally Grenache, packed with pure fruit flavors of cassis and blackberry compote. It retains sufficient acidity to keep it buoyant. Tannins are tongue scrapers, bone dry and astringent.

It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish.

70084,Renwood 2012 Red (Amador County),This wine shows an almost-black core with a red rim. Jammy blackberry aromas lead to rich and mouth-coating fruit flavors that are ripe.

70296,Pedroncelli 2012 Mother Clone Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and then aged almost a year in American oak, 30% of it new, this is fruity and smoky in equal measure.

70302,Four Fields 2012 Viognier (El Dorado),"Aromas of white peach and vanilla highlight this rich-textured, rather full-bodied white wine.

73855,Martin Ranch 2012 Thérèse Vineyards Lester Family Vineyard Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is immediately recognizable as a bottling from a cool-climate vineyard, with tons of cracked black pepper, asphalt and black fruit on the tense and intriguing nose. That pepper character follows through on the palate, mixing with crushed bay leaf, underripe elderberries and a touch of black currant, but fruit plays second to the spice and structure.

74696,Seven Deadly Zins 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"This has an unusually dark color. Aromas of blackberry jam and maple syrup are followed by equally rich, deep and expressive flavors. The remarkable concentration of ripe berry flavors layered densely with fine tannins is at least partly due to blending in Petite Sirah.

74709,Alder Springs 2012 Kinesis Red (Mendocino),"Lots of sweet berry flavors and equally large doses of fine-grained tannins are the opposite poles in this full-bodied blend. It smells like boysenberry and blackberry jam, with similar fruit notes on the palate. Then very firm tannins kick in, making the texture at once blanketing and a bit drying. This has so much flavor that time in the bottle will tame some of those tannins and leave plenty of character to enjoy. Best after 2019.",42.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103

78633,Whitecliff Vineyard 2012 Merlot-Malbec Red (New York),"Ripe bramble and and berry notes are concentrated in this crisp, elegant blend of Merlot and Malbec.

81739,Delectus 2012 Cuvée Julia Red (Knights Valley),"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this bombastic blend also has Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Sirah.

Only 92 acres are planted in all of California, including the ones Volk himself planted in Paso Robles in 1994. Aromas of red apple and pear slowly draw you in, not spilling all the goods on the nose. The flavors are relatively slight on the tongue, with nectarine, honeyed nuts and baked apple. The tight acidity makes it a great pairing for Thai and Vietnamese dishes.",24.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103

84467,Lost Blues 2012 Good Fences Grenache-Syrah (California),"At first whiff, there's a slightly odd funkiness to this co-fermented blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, but that blows off with time.

84676,Panache Cellars 2012 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This tiny Oregon winery sourced Yakima Valley fruit for this wine. Though many West Coast producers take a stab at this Italian grape, most settle for a faux “Super Tuscan,” highly oaked style.

84682,Dolin 2012 The Blue Note Red (Malibu Coast),"This blend of 44% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc makes a strong case for growing Bordeaux varieties in Malibu.

84840,Jaxon 2012 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),"Add Jaxon to the growing list of Southern Oregon wineries making exceptional Tempranillo. Plump and polished fruit flavors emphasize huckleberry, plum and black cherry. The aging for 21 months in French oak (one new barrel out of six) adds nuances of toasted walnuts, smoke and butterscotch. This is one of those surprising bottles that you just can't stop hitting on.",28.0,91,1,0.9650103428821103
84846,Marimar Estate 2012 Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown and Bottled Unfiltered Syrah (Russian River Valley),"As the producer's first 100% Syrah, this impressive wine shows the vibrancy of cool-climate influence in distinct notes of saddle leather and white pepper on the nose.

84887,Michael Gill Cellars 2012 Black Tie Syrah (Paso Robles),"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper.

85095,Patland 2012 Terra Del Cuore Estate Grown Malbec (Napa Valley),"This majority varietal wine contains 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, which doesn't help to soften its powerful grip of sturdy tannin and sideshow of oak.

85140,Joseph Phelps 2012 Insignia Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),"In this vintage, the producer's beloved blend is a commingling of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Two years in new French oak give it a youthful, tannic nature around smoky black cherry, burly leather and full-bodied richness and concentration.

87238,Terre Rouge 2012 Viognier (Fiddletown),"The earlier release of Terre Rouge's two Viogniers, this one, in screwcap, is clearly the friendlier and more immediately accessible.

87759,Black Star Farms 2012 Leorie Vineyard Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),"After a bit of searching through a blanket of coffee and cocoa, fresh red currant and plum show on the nose.

87968,Château Bianca 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"The unusual aromas on this wine are a confounding mix of fusel oil and grass, much like a Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has noticeable residual sugar as well. This seems way out of any varietal norm for Oregon Pinot Gris, but other than that, it's perfectly quaffable.",15.0,86,1,0.9650103428821103
87977,Benessere 2012 Scintillare Moscato (Napa Valley),"Made from 100% Muscat di Canelli grapes, retaining 9.5% residual sugar, this is a perfumed dessert wine, reminiscent of Gewürztraminer in its lychee aromas.

88123,Conspire 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"The winery's Rutherford-grown Sauvignon Blanc needs warm vintages to ripen. The last time that happened was in 2009.

88318,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An excellent follow-up to the 2011 Roussanne, this elegant, precise wine intrigues from the first sniffs of camomile, lemon zest and honeysuckle, right on through a full-bodied middle with a range of stone fruits.

94603,Maisonry 2012 Hudson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it.

94612,Avennia 2012 Oliane Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Two thirds Boushey Vineyard, and one third Red Willow, this pure Sauvignon Blanc has not yet completely knit itself together. There's a solid core of clean and tangy ripe lemon, citrus and pineapple fruit.

94717,Quivira 2012 Rosé (Dry Creek Valley),"The cold, uneven vintage gives this rosé a green, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc-style gooseberry aroma and flavor that makes it odd. There are some good watermelon and strawberry flavors, but it tastes unripe.",19.0,84,1,0.9650103428821103

95047,Naggiar 2012 Mistero Red (Sierra Foothills),"Not as full bodied as the tall bottle might indicate, this is instead a restrained, not-so-ripe wine that has an appetizing dryness, firm tannins and supportive acidity.

100699,Eberle 2012 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"The grapes for this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle are nearly equally sourced from three vineyards: Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and CoCaVin.

100809,Obelisco Estate 2012 Estate Grown Malbec (Red Mountain),"Aged in equal parts French and American oak (43% new), this initially puts barrel tones in the lead. Notes of toasty spices, cocoa, toffee and coffee come out in front of blue and black fruit. The flavors are sweet but reserved in style, trailing toward the finish. There's a lot to enjoy but the oak seems a little overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle.",45.0,88,1,0.9650103428821103

101386,Broken Earth 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Dense blackberry aromas meet with nuances of coffee, lavender and graphite on the nose of this bottling from a warm section of Paso Robles along Highway 46. The fruit is surprising bright on the sip, with black currant lifted by mocha, espresso syrup and purple flower touches. The acidity is quite strong and persistent, and it finishes the slightest hint of dried herbs.",28.0,89,1,0.9650103428821103

101675,Côtes de Ciel 2012 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Syrah Syrah (Red Mountain),"This Syrah was aged in 100% new oak, two thirds American and one third French. Barrel flavors abound, especially vanilla, and the fruit seems a bit overshadowed at this point in time. The tannins are aggressive, and overall this young wine seems to need more time in bottle to smooth out.",55.0,90,1,0.9650103428821103
101681,Miro 2012 Piccetti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This offers excellent refinement, with high-toned red-berry fruit and sarsaparilla that are on the edge of jammy—in a good way.

Wiemer 2012 HJW Vineyard Dry Estate Bottled and Grown Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of white blossoms and waxy lime and lemon skins, this dry, delicately composed Riesling is a stunner. Tart mango and and tangerine flavors are juicy on the palate, accented with lemon verbena and a lingering waxiness. It finishes remarkably long with a streak of lemon acidity and a zesty astringency. Delicious now for its youth and exuberance, but likely to develop well over through 2021–2024.",39.0,92,1,0.9650103428821103
101805,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Méthode Champenoise Brut  (Finger Lakes),"Saline and mineral tones accent fresh apple, pear and lemon in this zippy, invigorating sparkling wine.

101930,Shippey 2012 Flaming J Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Dark and inky, this wine is made from a small vineyard on the western slopes of its appellation, planted entirely to the variety.

102163,Legendre 2012 Tailrace Red (Amador County),"A relatively pale color and rather delicate plum and red cherry aromas suggest a light, elegant wine, but these are followed by richer flavors and a very tannic texture that dries the teeth like strong tea.

102164,Vellum 2012 Black Petit Verdot (Suisun Valley),"A very dry and firmly tannic wine, this doesn't give up much aroma, and the flavors also seem bound up with the astringent texture. With a bit of time some blueberry and blackberry aromas emerge, and flavors of black olive, too. This wine seems to require the most marbled steak to balance its austerity in texture, or perhaps 10 years in a cool cellar.",75.0,85,1,0.9650103428821103

107629,Robert Biale 2012 Old Kraft Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),"Soft, subdued, savory and subtle, Old Kraft dates back originally to the 1860s, much of its plantings traceable to the 1890s.

108643,Daou 2012 Mayote Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District),"It's no surprise that the Daou brothers blend of 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot packs a rich blueberry, dark chocolate and espresso nose. Nor is the lush mouthfeel, the grippy, fine-grained tannins, or the the black cherry, stewed beef and black peppercorn flavor profile particularly shocking.

109661,Vista Hills 2012 Orange Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"An interesting experiment, this Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for six months. It's a pale rose color, and the skin contact has resulted in some quite puckery phenolics.

But the wine is really all about fruit—massive flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots, oranges, pineapples, peaches and honey. While that sounds like a laundry list, if you pay attention you'll find each strand of the tapestry. At the same time, it's bone dry and balanced with acidity.

110434,Y Rousseau 2012 Pépé Cavedale Vineyard Merlot (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County),"Named for the producer's French grandfather, who loved Merlot, this 100% varietal wine from a high-elevation site is leathery, meaty and quite debonair.

Sattui 2012 Entanglement G-S-M (Napa Valley),"A Grenache-driven blend with 28% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this is a substantial, concentrated wine generous in leather, pipe tobacco and blackberry pie, accented teasingly in clove.

110554,Januik 2012 Weinbau Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This was aged in equal parts new and used French oak. The new takes the lead with its aromas and flavors of coffee, cocoa and barrel spices out in front of dark fruit.

110907,Darioush 2012 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This is a gorgeously luxurious wine, vibrant and alive in blackberry and raspberry, a savory lining of red currant providing its edge. The big tannin presence speaks to cellaring, through 2022, but a decant should help, too, allowing the herbal and fruit components to come into balance with its powerful density.",62.0,94,1,0.9650103428821103

The color is almost black to the rim, the aromas are meaty and peppery, and the flavors are very concentrated. The texture is thick and yet creamy with layered, smooth and bold tannins. For all its density and depth, however, this is not an overpowering monster.

111001,Shared Notes 2012 Les Pierres Qui Decident Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A rare style of California white, this is made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, but is not labeled that way. Striking smoky, white-pepper aromas and aggressive dried herb flavors jangle with apparent oak character. The combination of sharp acidity and soothing body begins to come together on the finish.

115127,Andis 2012 Amador Zinfandel Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"An assertive if not aggressive wine, it smells like smoke and charred wood, tastes like espresso dosed with raspberry syrup, and feels tannic, oaky and astringent.

458,Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley),"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",35.0,91,1,0.961534340884752

673,Pech Merle 2013 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine.

4208,Lang & Reed 2013 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones.

4250,Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley),"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed.

4552,Savage Grace 2013 Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills),"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs.

4625,Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island),"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate.

6361,Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit.

7108,Fenestra 2013 Semillon (Livermore Valley),"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat.",18.0,90,1,0.961534340884752

7531,Sanford 2013 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills),"A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea.

8449,Dry Creek Vineyard 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From vines averaging 95 years old, this is an impressive effort, in balance between savory, sultry overtones of peppercorn and espresso and a riper, juicier core of blackberry. Supportive acidity provides a freshness to the wine, which offers plenty of length and breadth on the finish.",32.0,93,1,0.961534340884752
8483,Efeste 2013 Eleni Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"The aromas of embers, black pepper, dark fruit, herbs, smoke and spice are brooding and locked up on first pour, showing more on each swirl. The blue and black-fruit flavors are ripe, sweet and full, with savory notes fleshing out the crazy long finish.",54.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8484,Elyse 2013 L'Ingenue White (Sierra Foothills),"Floral, citrus aromas, honeylike flavors and an unctuous texture make this white Rhône-style blend almost a dessert in a glass—without being sweet. The wine is full bodied, mouthfilling, complex and gushing with great pastry-like flavors.",32.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8486,Baer 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The variety announces itself with aromas of dark plum, fig, herbs and blackberry bud that enchant the senses.

8500,Efeste 2013 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain),"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs.",39.0,91,1,0.961534340884752
8501,Efeste 2013 Emmy Stone Tree Vineyard Mourvèdre (Wahluke Slope),"The white-pepper, garrigue, raspberry, orange-peel and pot-roast aromas pop. The palate is action packed with raspberry and cranberry flavors that lead to a long, savory finish.",49.0,91,1,0.961534340884752
8503,Fidelitas 2013 Optu Red (Red Mountain),"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (74%) with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine starts out brooding, with aromas of coffee, spice, vanilla, plum, dark fruit and high-toned herbs. The cherry and barrel spice flavors coat the palate, backed by firm tannins that need time to soften.",50.0,91,1,0.961534340884752
8543,Saracina 2013 Pick and Shovel Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish.",30.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8545,The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado),"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins. The distinctive flavors match the powerful structure, so it should age well. Best to drink after 2020.",36.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8554,Terre Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.",30.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8556,Three 2013 Live Oak Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist. There is little obvious oak to get in the way of flavors like vine-ripened raspberries and blackberries as they stream along on fine tannins and lithe acidity.",34.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
8557,Three 2013 Old Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish.",22.0,92,1,0.961534340884752
