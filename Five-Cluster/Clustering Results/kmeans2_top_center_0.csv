9282,Encanto 2012 Roble Mencía (Bierzo),"Grapy, balsamic aromas of blueberry and wild brush come with a hint of animal fur.

10145,Tinhof 2012 Feuersteig St. Laurent (Burgenland),"Crunchy red cherry and stone, the merest hint of vanilla and a densely-packed but toned texture of bundled, fine tannins make for a compact wine.

45105,Finca Hispana 2012 Cuvée Monastrell (Jumilla),"Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins.

45374,Domaine du Castel 2012 Grand Vin Red (Judean Hills),"Inky ruby in the glass, this Bordeaux-style blend has aromas of caramel and anise that all but hide a whiff of cherry.

45375,García Figuero 2012 Viñas Viejas  (Ribera del Duero),"Concentrated tight-grained oaky aromas rest on top of deep smoky blackberry and cassis scents.

45854,Koyle 2012 Costa Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Costa),"This is almost brutally austere.

This is overpowering and clipped; it has merits but needs to be more friendly.",25.0,84,0,0.9967532089723447
45860,Ochoa 2012 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"Whereas once Ochoa produced some of Navarra's best rosés, lately the wines have been marginal. This is awkward, with aromas of chemicals and rubber gloves.

45921,Marqués de Murrieta 2012 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),"This Viura smells oxidized and soft, with barrel-based aromas in charge.

46510,Pratsch 2012 Steinberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"An aroma of fresh, green Bartlett-pear peel comes first, then the riper notion of pear compote, with a grippy, lime-zest accent and a dash of pepper. Waves of flavor unfold on the tongue and give exquisite length. It has ample mileage to develop; enjoy it now while primary and zippy or wait for mellowed richness later. Either way, it belongs on the table. Drink 2014–2020.",24.0,92,0,0.9967532089723447
46597,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2012 Anderra Carmenère (Central Valley),"There's more meatiness, olive and wood to the nose than fruit aromas, and the palate is plump and a touch syrupy.

84884,Lapostolle 2012 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Plum, blackberry and boysenberry aromas show nuances of citrus peel and rubber band. On the palate, this is tight, mildly tannic and slightly astringent due to firm tannins. A mix of ripe blackberry and cassis flavors come with chocolaty oak in front of a hard-pushing, lightly herbal finish. Drink through 2018.",24.0,92,0,0.9967532089723447
84965,Torbreck 2012 The Pict Mataro (Barossa Valley),"Imagine a dark, smoky espresso bar, lined with leather banquettes. Mouthwatering scents of grilled meat waft in from a back garden. This is a full-bodied, plush rendering of Mourvèdre that doesn't show much freshness or fruit yet still caresses the palate.",75.0,91,0,0.9967532089723447
84976,Mascota 2012 Unánime Gran Vino Tinto Red (Mendoza),"Lush, jammy, soft aromas of black plum and cassis are full but a touch lazy. On first take, this feels saturated but deeper examination reveals zesty tartaric acidity.

85146,Kracher 2012 Zwischen den Seen Nr. 10 Trockenbeerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland),"The term “heady” surely was coined just for a wine like this—immensely rich but traveling on very light feet, concentrating the perfumed aromatics of Scheurebe on the palate while exuberantly vaporizing them on the nose. The honeyed blossoms of nettle come to mind as well as summer sprays of honeysuckle. The palate is ultrasweet, evoking tropical largesse of pineapple and passion fruit, always luminous, always bright. This is dessert in itself and shines with immense purity.",51.0,95,0,0.9967532089723447
85158,Alta Vista 2012 Single Vineyard Temis Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Inky berry and smoky, minerally aromas of charcoal properly introduce a saturated palate with tons of oak but even more fruit at its base. This supercharged Malbec is almost over the top, with massive blackberry, chocolate and molasses flavors. Burnt toast and chocolate mint-chip flavors on the finish confirm that this is a monster red.

86059,Balduzzi 2012 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Berry and cassis aromas are a bit raisiny and steer clear of the varietal-based green that Carmenère is known for.

86159,Naia 2012 Las Brisas White (Rueda),"Apricot and nectarine notes rise up from the bouquet. This is juicy but bland, with melon and green-herb flavors.

88637,Robert Weil 2012 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"A sweet trail of orange marmalade percolates through this succulently sweet wine. On the midpalate, savory tones of smoke, nuts and bruised apple add shades of complexity, but the finish is pure and pristine, a shower of lemon and honey that goes on endlessly.",365.0,94,0,0.9967532089723447
88699,Quinta do Cavalinho 2012 Herdade dos Templários Grande Escolha Red (Tejo),"This is a rich wine, soft and juicy. Superripe—perhaps overripe—fruit gives a jammy character to the wine. The core woody flavor from aging in French and American oak is prominent and needs to round out. Drink from 2017.",25.0,86,0,0.9967532089723447
88718,Angosto 2012 La Tribu Red (Valencia),"After a sulfuric, gaseous opening, ripe aromas of blackberry and black cherry along with a hint of horsehide rise up.

88720,Castillo de Maluenda 2012 Punto y Coma Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Calatayud),"Minerally raspberry and plum aromas are smoky and woodsy in nature.

88757,Valle da Fonte 2012 Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),"Big damson fruits dominate this rich wine. The wood aging has smoothed out some of the dense tannins although the wine remains firm and solid. There's a sense of power behind the juicy dark fruits and the dry core. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",25.0,92,0,0.9967532089723447

88802,Dr. Hermann 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Fresh orange peels lend a zesty vibe to summer melon and peach flavors in this decadent, sun-kissed Riesling. It's so delicate in texture, it's as if gossamer layers of acid and sweetness could dance on the palate, but the finish lingers long with a streak of honey, wax and lanolin. Delicious now, but it's components should meld gorgeously from 2017 and on.",55.0,92,0,0.9967532089723447
88803,Dr. Loosen 2012 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Pink grapefruit and waxy lanolin notes entice on this intensely fruity, honey-kissed Riesling.

88850,Mission Hill 2012 Southern Cross Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley),"Partially (35%) fermented in French oak, this is a soft, round and fruity wine.

88882,Quinta da Romaneira 2012 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"This is a rich wine in a dry style for Port, bringing out the red fruits as well as dried fruits and acidity.

88923,Chaman 2012 Red (La Consulta),"Floral red-fruit aromas are slightly medicinal and suggestive of cherry cough drop.

89372,Rutini 2012 Apartado Gran Malbec (Mendoza),"Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid.

89724,Emina 2012 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Jammy blueberry and prune aromas are ripe but a bit dull and rudimentary.

Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit.
