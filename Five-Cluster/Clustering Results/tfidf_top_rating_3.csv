100099,Château Cheval Blanc 2010  Saint-Émilion,"This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine.",1500.0,100,3,0.2754109229966164
105755,Verité 2007 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),"This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",450.0,100,3,0.26307297900242377
103998,Alpha Omega 2012 ERA Red (Napa Valley),"This blend from individual blocks includes 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Merlot. Juicy and round, it expresses chocolate, vanilla, dark cherry and cassis flavors and is a joy to drink and experience evolve. Despite plenty of ripe power and lushness, it also boasts substantial elegance.",300.0,99,3,0.2699173512496105
34830,Yao Ming 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"We can debate the pricing on Yao Ming's new reserve, but what's undeniable, by any modern standard, is the wine's excellence. A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years.",625.0,98,3,0.29642180935702545
1417,Pirouette 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.",50.0,98,3,0.2738439173228189
70829,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2004 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"This is a hopelessly gorgeous wine with so much energy, intensity, density and good cheer. The superb ensemble—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot—delivers chocolate fudge, ripe cherry, rhubarb, cola, tobacco and cedar wood. It's tight and supple, with seamless harmony and excellent succulence on the finish. But it's that incredible intensity that truly sets this wine apart.",175.0,98,3,0.25943546656964384
74118,Continuum 2007 Red (Napa Valley),"Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",140.0,97,3,0.32026335135801115
88295,Viader 2010 Red (Napa Valley),"Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years.",200.0,97,3,0.3062292473823249
1421,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2008 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry. There are beautiful elements of soft spice and chocolate at the back and the wine ends with soft, plush tannins and smooth, berry-rich flavors.",215.0,97,3,0.3034955213687179
73347,Stonestreet 2007 Black Cougar Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Pretty much as good as any Cabernet out there, if not better, and at a fraction of the price you'll pay for the “cults.” If there was ever a wine made for the cellar, it's this one, the antidote for those who consider California Cabernet a simple fruit bomb. Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is. Drink 2013–2020 and beyond.",75.0,97,3,0.30296716988678596
109829,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2008 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined. If you can keep your hands off it, this is a wine to cellar for many years.",195.0,97,3,0.2967459664164198
43712,Betz Family 2005 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry.",55.0,97,3,0.2920356016532499
114196,Arkenstone 2006 Obsidian Red (Howell Mountain),"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome. Near perfect tannins, soft and intricately firm, and grand acidity make for a total Cabernet experience. Tremendous now, and should age for years.",120.0,97,3,0.2875356263662003
38341,Lynmar 2007 Hawk Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An extraordinarily lush, dramatic Pinot Noir. Dense and full-bodied, it shows flashy flavors of black and red berries, currants, cola, pomegranates and dusty spices, enhanced with the most perfect application of smoky oak and wrapped into a rich, silky texture. The balance is exquisite, a tension of acidity and tannins. Beautiful now, and should develop bottle complexity for at least six years.",70.0,97,3,0.28615155740657194
105759,Verité 2008 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County),"The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014.",450.0,97,3,0.28350008543405414
100702,Arista 2005 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Showing the superb structure of the vintage and the spectacular way this great vineyard can ripen Pinot Noir, this polished wine is not only delicious from the get-go, but ageable. Floods the mouth with lush black cherry, red currant, cola, sweet oak, anise, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on. A memorable wine that should slowly gather steam and peak by 2011, then begin a long, steady arc downward.",54.0,97,3,0.2828199095141538
40894,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2006 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Consistently among Italy's top-scoring wines, this vintage of the celebrated Ornellaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a gorgeous expression of the very best of European enology. It delivers extraordinary richness, succulence and intensity, but remains elegant to the end. Aromas include black cherry, spice and dark chocolate.",200.0,97,3,0.28161139848129035
73350,Black Coyote 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"Tasted blind in a large group of Napa Valley Cabernets, this one stood out for sheer power and authority. It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020.",85.0,97,3,0.27654148383553256
45461,Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.",150.0,97,3,0.27616357542219927
115017,Trefethen 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least.",50.0,97,3,0.275981371166571
