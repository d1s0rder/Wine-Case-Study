63874,Paul Hobbs 2010 Richard Dinner Vineyard Cuvée Agustina Chardonnay (Sonoma Mountain),"Made in the popular modern style, this is a particular success. It shows ultraconcentrated orange, apricot, green apple and peach flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture, and a strong coating of oak brings layers of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. This richness would be excessive without the minerality and acidity that Sonoma Mountain brings. Don't drink this too cold.",100.0,94,4,0.967226227373154
110068,Marimar Estate 2012 Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown and Bottled Chardonnay-Albariño (Russian River Valley),"There's quite a bit of new French oak used in this blend, adding complexity in the form of buttered toast notes. But the wine is really all about fruit—massive flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots, oranges, pineapples, peaches and honey. While that sounds like a laundry list, if you pay attention you'll find each strand of the tapestry. At the same time, it's bone dry and balanced with acidity. Don't drink it too cold.",34.0,92,4,0.9672217860545437
47676,MacLaren 2015 Lee's Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This small-production, light and bright white wine is worth seeking out and succumbing to, lovely in green apple, peach, almond and apricot. It was fermented in neutral-oak barrels, the oak adding just enough body to what is otherwise a balanced and restrained wine encased in minerality.",28.0,90,4,0.9672210979089089
14146,Villa Raiano 2013 Alimata  (Fiano di Avellino),"Yellow flower, Mediterranean herb, cut grass, crisp green apple, juicy citrus and intense mineral are some of the sensations offered by this structured and savory white.

40786,Ventana 2008 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"The aromas and tastes of oak dominate this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and sweet caramel riding high over the pineapple, mango and pear flavors. But crisp acidity provides needed balance, and there's a fine minerality that gives a tang of stone. A good price for a Chard this complicated.",13.0,87,4,0.9672002997721113
28016,Stonestreet 2009 Broken Road Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Dry, racy and elegant, a food-friendly Chardonnay to pair with shellfish in cream sauce, salmon, or a fine roasted chicken.

109795,Loimer 2015 Langenlois Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"There is something juicy on the nose that suggests freshly cut apple and pear. The palate is rich with these flavors but something mellow, savory and yeasty cuts in that is reminiscent of miso and soy, adding interest and above all spice. The palate veers between fruit and spice but is united by bright lemony freshness. The lasting savoriness is testament to this wine's concentration and balance.",60.0,94,4,0.9671905713431153
103526,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato 2014 Demi Long  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"Heady scents of jasmine, wisteria, chopped herbs and fresh orchard fruit lead the way on this delicious sparkler.

108320,Diatom 2016 Machado Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Greg Brewer resurrects his briefly shuttered brand to show what can be done on the floral edge of Chardonnay. This bottling that is very light in the glass offers tons of boisterous fruit displayed with delicacy, including tuberose, orange blossoms, lime and ripe pears. Guava powers the sip along with coconut, mango and apple-blossom flavors, wrapped in a tantalizing acidity. It would go great with sushi.",42.0,92,4,0.9671854470768683
9418,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Skyline Riesling (Monterey),"A wonderful Riesling, so polished and pretty.

65447,Domaine Schoffit 2011 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A rather earthy pull envelopes the fruit: both of dried apple and fresh, ripe pear. The palate adds a honeyed tone to this and a fluid richness that glides like silk across the palate. All is fringed with pleasantly bitter hints of crushed apple seeds, creating appetizing tension between sweet and bitter poles. This really holds your attention.",53.0,93,4,0.9671517997831054
72949,Robert Hall 2006 Blanc de Robles White (Paso Robles),"Hall hits all the right notes with this unusual white Rhône blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Piquepol Blanc.

85255,Gainey 2014 Limited Selection Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Warm aromas of yellow peach, baked-apple croissant, vanilla and marzipan show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime family-run winery near the town of Santa Ynez.

Mouthwatering aromas of toasted nuts and pineapple set the stage for a full-bodied, rich, succulent wine experience whose finish lingers.

42593,Foley 2013 Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip.",30.0,92,4,0.9670923113058039

25314,Daedalus Cellars 2007 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Delicate and poised, this unusual Pinot Gris was fermented half in stainless and half in neutral oak, then kept on the lees for an extended period before bottling.

71326,Mariposa 2016 Albariño (Edna Valley),"This bottling combines the variety's zippy character with a touch of ripeness, which makes it accessible to many palates.

15633,Anthony Nappa 2013 Giallo Sémillon (North Fork of Long Island),"Bold and unconventional, there's nothing quite like this late-harvest wine. Made from Sémillon grapes left to ripen and shrivel through midwinter, it's deeply concentrated with dried mango and orange-peel flavors. Fermentation via natural yeast on its skins lends a deeply phenolic astringency to the palate. It's dusty and mineral with a sherried aldehydic character attributable to deliberate oxidation in barrels, yet somehow, it maintains a luminous core of fresh fruit. A curious and thought-provoking wine for the adventurous wine lover.",40.0,89,4,0.9670504974650632

75685,Adelsheim 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"A solid effort from a well-balanced vintage, this is whole-cluster pressed and largely fermented in stainless steel.

52682,Tablas Creek 2006 Esprit de Beaucastel White (Paso Robles),"This Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul blend may be technically dry, but it's so rich in fruity extract, it tastes almost as sweet as an off-dry dessert wine.

The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own.

39108,Jacob's Creek 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (South Australia),"JC is making an effort to upgrade its Reserve range, and this is a good example, offering peach and pineapple flavors framed by vanilla, butter and toast.

83678,Radog 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"The Arroyo Seco is a rocky bench between the Salinas Valley and the Santa Lucia Highlands. It's really great terroir for white wines because the conditions allow for extraordinarily long hangtime, while cool, foggy nights preserve vital acidity.

70302,Four Fields 2012 Viognier (El Dorado),"Aromas of white peach and vanilla highlight this rich-textured, rather full-bodied white wine. It's made in a generous rather than crisp style, as if it were barrel fermented, and a buttery lushness defines it more than the fairly subtle fruit flavors.

52310,Daou 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaida District),"This is a richer style of Sauvignon Blanc, as would be expected from the Daou brothers, but is a fresher style than the last vintage. Aromas of toast, oak and yellow fruit prove quite seductive, and the palate proves grippy with dried lemon peels and cut-grass touches.

103463,Bonair 2005 Chateau Puryear Vineyard Chardonnay (Rattlesnake Hills),"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya.

59406,Four Vines 2006 Naked Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine.

13533,Columbia Winery 2007 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Some diesel and cracker on the nose, along with the usual Gewürztraminer mix of citrus and soap. The fruit is substantial and fills out the midpalate, offering peaches, apricots, suggestions of papaya and some crisp, apple acids. In keeping with past vintages, this new release is finished at just under 3% residual sugar. It should stand up nicely to spicy noodle dishes.",12.0,87,4,0.9626638324283169
107174,Salomon-Undhof 2009 Bienenfeld Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040.",38.0,96,4,0.9626633250304993

38998,Bergström 2013 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"The Sigrid never fails to deliver lush fruit and hedonistic barrel flavors. However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well.

39916,Piera Martellozzo 2013 Giade  (Prosecco),"As the cloudy sediment at the bottom of the bottle indicates, this intriguing Prosecco was refermented in the bottle as opposed to in steel tanks. It opens with a heady aroma of white flower, green apple and kiwi. These carry over to the palate with a hint of exotic fruit and lime alongside a soft, persistent mousse and brisk acidity.

40458,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Burg White (Alsace),"Hints of peach and blossom tell of aromatic varieties in this field blend. The palate confirms this with the rich, almost oily texture of rose oil.

28848,Moorooduc 2013 Robinson Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula),"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon.

30800,Maison Bleue 2007 Notre Vie Viognier (Yakima Valley),"The blend is 85% Viognier and 15% Roussanne, and finishes off-dry with 1.5% residual sugar.

It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance.
