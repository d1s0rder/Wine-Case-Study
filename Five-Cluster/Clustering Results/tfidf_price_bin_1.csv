108638,Tenuta Roveglia 2013 Vigne di Catullo Riserva  (Lugana),"Delicately scented, this radiant wine opens with ultrarefined scents of white field flower, citrus blossom, aromatic herb and a whiff of orchard fruit. The creamy, elegantly structured palate boasts layers of juicy white peach, crisp green apple, tangerine and a hint of white almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while an energizing mineral note closes the lingering finish.",24.0,94,1,0.38594154489682386,20-40
74187,Rosenhof 2015 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),"The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length.",30.0,95,1,0.3243008214747286,20-40
34913,Dutton-Goldfield 2015 Dutton Ranch Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley),"Juicy acidity buoys layers of wet stone, crisp apple and white peach in this lovely aromatic white. Textured, subtle and complex, it's fresh in the glass, accented in floral rose petals, grapefruit and lemon peel, dry and fermented entirely in stainless steel.",30.0,94,1,0.363809146639964,20-40
92148,Malat 2014 Alte Reben Höhlgraben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"A touch of flint on fleshy peach is followed by juicy citrus and ripe pear bedded in nettle and watercress. Together they present an immensely enticing nose, hinting at whole oceans of luscious fruit beneath the surface. The palate then invokes all the varietal spice: white pepper, arugula and chervil, illuminated by bright, zesty citrus to finish in a concert of layered zestiness. Overtones of orange and pink grapefruit zest make it even more compelling. Lip-smackingly irresistible and a paradigm of its vintage.",36.0,95,1,0.31933909401461746,20-40
53724,Paul Blanck 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Dried lemon peel and hay flowers make for an inviting nose. On the palate, the vivid brightness of lemon brightens notes of tart apple and the merest touch of earth and stone. This is precise and pure, absolutely dry and magnificent. The freshness is incisive and invigorating. It's another one of those gloriously bright and unapologetically fresh 2014 Rieslings. Clearly a vintage for adults only. The finish is lip-smackingly clean and utterly moreish. Drink 2017–2037.",36.0,95,1,0.29817462014256996,20-40
14036,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Mandelberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Earth and apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose and palate. It is the green apple with its chamomile edge and above all the bright ripe lemon freshness which expands across the dry palate. This is full of bright refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030.",40.0,94,1,0.35049014530740386,20-40
14031,Boeckel 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 2017–2030 at least.",42.0,94,1,0.36281736725390373,above 40
100710,Stonestreet 2006 Upper Barn Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"This is a big, powerful Chardonnay that impresses for sheer volume. Crisp acidity provides a keen balance to the ripe pineapple, white peach custard, sweet green apple purée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors that finish with a smoky swirl of dusty spices.",42.0,94,1,0.36677975037593774,above 40
14021,Domaine Zinck 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The tart but tropical charm of passion fruit plays around the nose before more zesty citrus notes become apparent. The palate is generous with juicy peach, yellow pear and citrus. The vein of lemon freshness at the core is totally seductive. While the palate is patently dry, the absolute juiciness of the fruit will get you, as will the clean but aromatic finish. Drink 2017–2027.",49.0,94,1,0.351206758335219,above 40
19973,Domaine Zinck 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The tart but tropical charm of passion fruit plays around the nose before more zesty citrus notes become apparent. The palate is generous with juicy peach, yellow pear and citrus. The vein of lemon freshness at the core is totally seductive. While the palate is patently dry, the absolute juiciness of the fruit will get you, as will the clean but aromatic finish. Drink 2017–2027.",49.0,94,1,0.351206758335219,above 40
88986,Biecher & Schaal 2015 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",50.0,95,1,0.3408860842520813,above 40
41076,Royal Tokaji 2013 5 Puttonyos Aszú Red Label  (Tokaji),"Straw colored with gold reflections, this delightful sweet wine has aromas of dried pear, fresh apricot and yellow peach. Flavors of fresh Bartlett pear, acacia honey and tinned apricots unfold on the palate. The finish is sweet, with just the right amount of acidity.",54.0,96,1,0.3115394428209559,above 40
82291,Bucci 2013 Villa Bucci Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),"Finesse abounds on this radiant wine, starting with alluring scents of Spanish broom, aromatic herb, citrus and a delicate whiff of beeswax. On the elegantly structured palate, a mineral vein underscores crisp apple, pear, lemon zest and white almond. Vibrant acidity provides the backbone. It's still young so give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2018 through 2028.",57.0,95,1,0.3129454561093549,above 40
53716,Gustave Lorentz 2011 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of luscious peach plays among the ripe lemon notes of the nose. A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish. Drink 2017–2030.",60.0,95,1,0.3099718757254583,above 40
24016,Bründlmayer 2015 Heiligenstein Lyra Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"The merest hint of reduction reminds you of how young this wine actually is. On the palate, a very generous full-fruited picture unfolds: there is very ripe juicy yellow pear and countless juicy citrus notions of clementine, tangerine, satsuma and orange. All of this is cut with precise, tart and ripe lemon freshness. This interplay of tart and ripe creates tension and drive. This is lovely now but is a powerhouse of potent long-lasting fruit. Drink 2017–2040.",70.0,95,1,0.2970129243201588,above 40
53730,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"Hay flowers, honey and ripe yellow pear create an alluring nose. The palate adds even more fruit, with juicy mirabelle and peach carried by boost of residual sugar. This richness is aptly countered by lemon and tangerine zest. This joyful exuberant medium-sweet wine has a tightrope balance and incredibly deep and rich dimensions of fruit. The finish is lasting and pure. Drink 2017–2037.",74.0,95,1,0.30338010323904324,above 40
52227,Paul Hobbs 2010 Edwards James Estate Wente Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"There isn't a Chardonnay out there as rich, opulent and delicious as this one. It dazzles with tropical fruit, pear, peach, green apple, honey, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Brisk, lime-driven acidity provides beautiful balance. It's oaky, but the smoky, buttered-toast and butterscotch notes are nearly perfect. Drink now with rich crab, lobster or scallop dishes.",75.0,95,1,0.33388106964126935,above 40
104014,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035.",80.0,95,1,0.31854235739432324,above 40
68519,Klein Constantia 2007 Vin de Constance Muscat (Constantia),"A well-balanced, powerful dessert wine, this opens with an intense bouquet of fresh peach, orange blossom, jasmine, gardenia and honeysuckle. The mouthfilling, sweet palate is loaded with flavors of ripe stone fruit, mango, melon and orange marmelade, but is kept bright by refreshing acidity on the close. Secondary notes of ginger and white tea linger long on the evolving finish. A wine of class and strength, this is delicious now, but should also easily age through 2020.",90.0,95,1,0.3173960572039381,above 40
24642,Wittmann 2015 Westhofen Morstein Trocken GG Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Electric acidity and pure, pristine fruit collide in this full-bodied Riesling. Dry in style, it offers layers of crisp green melon, apple and lime flavors, with a textural density that's profoundly majestic. While beautiful already, its mineral richness should only intensify over the next decade.",92.0,95,1,0.31934906436635097,above 40
